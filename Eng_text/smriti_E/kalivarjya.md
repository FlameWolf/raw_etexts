Yogendra Ramanathapura, you said that "Manusmriti advises not to have niyoga paddhati at all" but that is not correct. Manusmriti 9.56 onwards gives the details on this: 
vidhavAyAM niyuktastu ghR^itAkto vAgyato nishi |
ekam utpAdayet putraM na dvitIyaM kathamchana ||
Manu says this niyoga is applicable only in case of a difficult situation (and also when there is no progeny for the deceased). The section also mentions that the brother-in-law must treat the widow like a mother (if elder bro's wife) or like a daughter (if younger bro's wife).

You are right that other smritis stopped this practice for kaliyuga. Generally the following verse from yajnavaalkya smriti, which gives this as one of the kalivarjya (things forbidden in kaliyuga): 

yugadharmAH parigrAhyAH sarvatraiva yathochitaM | 
**devarAt sutopattiH** vAnaprasthAshramagrahaH |
**dattAxatAyA kanyAyA punardAnaM parasya vai |**
mahAprasthAnagamanaM gopashushcha surAgrahaH | 
asavarNAsu kanyAsu vivAhashcha dvijAtiShu | 
prAyashchittavidhAnaM tu viprANAM maraNAntikam |
samsargadoShaH pApeShu madhuparke pashorvadhaH |
putraM datvetareShAM tu putratvena parigrahaH |
dIrghakAlaM brahmacharyaM naramedhAshvamedhakam |
kalau tvimAn dharmAn varjyAnyAhurmanIShiNaH |

As you can see, a widow remarriage is also prohibited. But our Vishnu Shanbhag sent me an article around last year from RG Bhandarkar upholding the marriage of a widow, whose earlier marriage wasn't consummated. I don't know how our people consider those quotes.

So it is not correct to say that there are fewer restrictions in kaliyuga. In fact the restrictions are more, because kali corrupts the mind by default so the mental strength needed to do some things like niyoga, with dispassion and as pure devatAkArya, is impossible. So more restrictions are put.

From a practical point of view, I have the same questions about a widow's life, particularly a young one. I don't think any current Achar / swamiji can offer a good solution without being deviant from scripture. This is certainly an unfortunate part of our scriptures.
