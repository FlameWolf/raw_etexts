**FOREWORD**

THE awakening in our country has a much wider significancethan most people, with their preoccupation in the struggle for political freedom, recognise. The desire for self-government isonly one phase and not the most important phase of thisgeneral awakening. The awakening is like a rising flood that covers the whole space between the banks or, more appropriately,like a flood of light that lights every nook and corner. In artsand letters, in music and painting and sculpture, and in fact, in allthe departments of life, the new consciousness is doing its work.  
     In the sphere of music, this awakening has been a visible process. For years, Sangitha Sabhas have, in different parts ofthe Madras City, had their annual celebrations; and their weeklyperformances have been increasing from year to year. There is now a vast and growingly larger number of men and women in the country taking an interest in music and themselves learning tosing. Academies of music are springing up; and broadcasts ofmusic are being attended by vast crowds. There is evidence,which few can fail to recognise, that in music, as in other spheres,this awakening is at work.  
    That there is a literature dealing with South Indian music is known. Few, outside the small class of experts conversant with the theory of music or music as a science, know even the names of the writers. It is, therefore, a great service at this moment to open up theliterature of Indian music and make it available to the public. Mr. M. S. Ramaswami Aiyar, who is an eminent exponent of the present-day music, both in its theoreticand practical aspects, is eminently fitted to undertake this task.And the public owes a debt of gratitude to the Annamalai University for the help and encouragement which it has given toMr. Ramaswami Aiyar in performing this very useful service.  
    Râmâmâtya, the author of the book here published, recognised twenty Mêlas; his successors went on increasing thenumber; and the present-day theory recognises seventy-two, though it is doubtful whether all of them are in actual use or cansatisfy the ear of the people. It is a result of pure mathematicsa question of how many combinations of the seven notes and theirvariations can be made. Mr. Ramaswami Aiyar thinks that even the two and thirty were the resulting combination of the seven notes, five of which had a sharp and flat sonance and the word 'raga'itself indicates the number 32, according to the peculiar Indian Notation of numbers by the letters of the alphabet. A questionmay here arise as to whether the word 'raga' was a new introduction into music after the thirty-two Mêlas had come to berecognised.  
   Mr. Ramaswami Aiyar refers to a criticism of the author bya successor of his, that two of his twenty Mêlas have the samenotes. I am inclined to agree with Mr. Ramaswami Aiyar that itmust be a slip and the manuscripts may be responsible for it. Isit impossible to find out what combination it must be for eitherthe one or the other that has been written amiss and resulted in the error criticised?  
    Experts, like Mr. Ramaswami Aiyar, must not only open upthe past of music but point the way to its future.

**PREFACE**

THE manuscripts of *Svaramêlakalânidhi* are found in Tanjore,Madras, Baroda, and Bikanir. Its bare text, for aught I know,was printed twice—*first*, at Kumbakonam in 1906 by Mr. S.Nârayanaswâmi Aiyar and *secondly*, at Bombay in 1910 byMr. V. N. Bhâtkhandê, though under the pseudonym ofBhâradvâja Sarma. The latter edition contained, at least, arunning commentary in Maharâti.  
  But both the printed editions happened to be, alike,defective and even misleading. I shall give only one instanceand pass on.  
  In the fifth chapter of the work, the two Râgas of*Sudhavasantha* and *Mâlavasri* are correctly defined, in two[verses[^20] thus:—

[^20]: # "The verse regarding Sudhavasantha is marked A, while that regarding Mâlavasri is marked B."

***Sudhavasantha.***

A.**रागः शुद्धवसन्ताख्यः सांशः स्यात्सग्रहस्तथा।  
   पत्वर्जितः षाडवोऽपि ह्यवरोहे पसंयुतः।  
   एवं लक्ष्ये प्रसिद्धोऽसौ गेयो यामे तुरीयके॥**

**इति शुद्धवसन्तः।**

***Mâlavasri***

B.**रिवर्जितो मालवश्रीः सांशः स्यात्सग्रहोऽपि च।  
   गीयते सर्वयामेषु सर्वदा मङ्गलप्रदः॥**

**इति मालवश्रीः।**

  But how did Messrs. Nârayanaswâmi Aiyar and Bhâtkhandê present to us, in their respective editions, the same two Râgas ? Both of them gave us, alike, the following two lines regardingthe point under consideration :—

**रागः शुद्धवसन्ताख्यः सन्यासः स ग्रहोऽपिच।  
गीयते सर्वयामेषु सर्वदा मङ्गलप्रदः॥**

  Here, both of them consciously began with *Sudhavasantha*but unconsciously ended with *Mâlavasri*. In other words, theytook the first line of A and the last line of B, mixed themtogether with a little modification, and produced a meaninglessjargon which explained neither of the two Râgas.  
  A fresh edition of *Svaramêlakalânidhi* containing, as itought, a full and correct text, a true and free translation, and ahistorical and critical introduction is therefore felt as adesideratum-to supply which mine is an humble contributionor, at best, a provoker of a better one.  
  I feel bound to record here that the credit of havingprepared a correct version of the Sanskrit Text of *Svaramêlakalânidhi* and enabled me to bring it to the light of the day-belongs to the joint-labour of the two veteran Sanskrit scholarsof Tanjore-Messrs. P. S. Sundaram Aiyar and Pundit S. Subrahmanya Sâstri, who are also well-versed in the *theory* ofIndian Music. I heartily thank them there for and also for thekindness where with they went through the proof-sheets andeven otherwise gave me very valuable hints and suggestions.  
 Thanks be, also, to the Diocesan Press, Madras, for itsprompt and neat execution of the work.  
  It only remains for me to say that, on February 1, 1931, Idelivered the subject-matter of *Svaramêlakalânidhi* as a Lectureunder the auspices of the Annamalai University which, I feelthankful to state, was good enough to give her *imprimatur* to itspublication in the present form.

**INTRODUCTION**

**===========**

*  Svaramêlakalânidhi* is one of the standard works, in Sanskrit,on the *Carnatic* Music. Râmâmâtya, its author, was a native of Ândhradêsa and lived in or about Kôndavit[^1], which was not faraway from Bezwada, in the principality of which he had a fort ofhis own and in the vicinity of which he enjoyed the overlordship[^2] of a large estate of land washed by the eastern sea. He belongedto the Tôdarmal family; his father was Thimmâmâtya;[^21]and hehimself was such an efficient musician-composer that he won thetitle of ‘[Abhinava Bharatâchârya](http://This%20means%20Modern%20Bharatâchârya. "This means Modern Bharatâchârya.")'.  
  He was associated with Râma Râja of Vijayanagar, perhapsas his minister, as the word *amâtya* indicates. His father too hadthe same title of 'amâtya' appended to his name. But whetherthe father and the son were ever real ministers, who moulded the destinies of Vijayanagar, or were so called only by way of courtesy— a glance at the History of Vijayanagar seems to throw a doubt on.  
  Nothing else is known to us of the father than his fatherhood. As for the son, Râmâmâtya, he exhibited his person, in his work,more as a prolific *Vâggêyakâra* than a serious-minded politician.All that he could record of himself was :--- (1) He had studied the secret of [music](http://अधीतसंगीतकलारहस्यम्%20-%20Svaramelakalanidhi. "अधीतसंगीतकलारहस्यम् - Svaramelakalanidhi.").
(2) He alone, of all others, knew both the theory and art of [music](http://सलक्ष्यलक्ष्मोभयसारवेदी%20संदृश्यते%20नैव%20भवानिवान्यः%20-%20Ibid. "सलक्ष्यलक्ष्मोभयसारवेदी संदृश्यते नैव भवानिवान्यः - Ibid.").
(3) The traditional lore of music, in-herited from his grandfather, Kallapadêsika—evidently, Kallinâth,a Commentator of *Sangitharatnâkara*—palpitated in his pulse.¹ (4) Râma Râja requested him, in preference to others, to write anew treatise on music reconciling the conflicting views that were then in vogue.² And (5) the same Râma Râja gave him, in recognition of his (musical) services many a valuable present.³  
  This, surely, is not the language of a veritable *minister*, whowielded the mighty empire of Vijayanagar and who, in theintervals of his State-business, managed to write a musical work also, just as Mr. Gladstone wrote his *Homer* or Vidyâranya, his*Panchadasî*.  
  Further, a reference to Robert Sewell's *Forgotten Empire*shows that Achyutha succeeded Krishna Râya Dêva in 1530, that Sadâsiva succeeded Achyutha in 1542, and that the latter(Sadâsiva) was virtually a prisoner in the hands of Râma Râja who was, at first, his minister but became afterwards [independent](http://Vide%20Sewell%20s%20Forgotten%20Empire,%20page%20109. "Vide Sewell s Forgotten Empire, page 109."). By ‘independent', Sewell should have meant that Râma Râja was *de facto* the ruler of Vijayanagar. So he might  
have been. But *de jure* the ruler was, undoubtedly, Sadâsiva ; for, a very large number of inscriptions, ranging from 1542 to 1568, recognize Sadâsiva as the *real* [sovereign](http://Ibid-page%20179. "Ibid-page 179.").Why, Râmâmâtya himself admits that Râma Râja helped Sadâsiva to regain his throne.⁶ Hence, it is submitted, Râma Râja should have

been, at least whenRâmâmâtya wrote his work, only a minister,though the king was a puppet in his hands. How, then, couldRâmâmâtya afford to be a minister of a minister?  
  Further again, Râmâmâtya's description of Râma Râja'spedigree is more fanciful than real and betrays the mentality of aflattering court-poet rather than that of a responsible State-officer.  
  The following Table shows Râma Râja's pedigree, accordingto Râmâmâtya :—

<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1691913378Untitled1.png"/>  
(FIG. 1)

  But Sewell's [genealogy](http://Sewell%20s%20Forgotten%20Empire,%20page%20180. "Sewell s Forgotten Empire, page 180.")¹, taken from epigraphical records,gives Râma Râja his proper place in the royal line of Vijayanagarthus:—

<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1691913655Untitled2.png"/>

  It is thus clear that Râma Râja belonged, if at all, to theroyal family only by marriage. Râmâmâtya only confirmed itwhen he observed: "Krishna Râya gave his daughter inmarriage to Râma Râja and thereby enhanced the dignity of theparenthood of [daughters](http://कन्या%20प्रदोऽस्मै%20स%20तु%20कृष्णरायः%20कन्या%20पितृत्वं%20बहुमन्यते%20स्म%20।%20Svaramêlakalânidhi. "कन्या प्रदोऽस्मै स तु कृष्णरायः कन्या पितृत्वं बहुमन्यते स्म । Svaramêlakalânidhi.")."  
  History gives us no pedigree of Râma Râja except that hewas a son of one Ranga and that he had two brothers, namely,Thimma Râja and [Venkatâdri](http://Vide%20Sewell%20s%20Forgotten%20Empire,%20page%20214. "Vide Sewell s Forgotten Empire, page 214.").This Thimma Râja is said tohave murdered Sadâsiva in 1568 and usurped his [throne](http://Ibid,%20page%20212. "Ibid, page 212."). ButRâma Râja ruled, if at all, only on behalf of his king, Sadâsiva.  
True, he was a brave [soldier](http://विजित्य%20सर्वानपि%20पारशीकान्रणेषु%20तत्कीर्त्तिपटच्चराणि%20।%20आधूय%20भूयो%20हरितो%20वधूटीर्विशोभयत्येष%20यशोदुकूलैः%20॥%20Svaramêlakalânidhi. " विजित्य सर्वानपि पारशीकान्रणेषु तत्कीर्त्तिपटच्चराणि । आधूय भूयो हरितो वधूटीर्विशोभयत्येष यशोदुकूलैः ॥ Svaramêlakalânidhi."); but he was over-ambitiousand a little reckless too, with the result that he precipitated the battle of Talikota in 1565 and brought about his owndeath.

  I digressed, so far, only to emphasise my doubt whetherRâmâmâtya was a minister in fact or only by courtesy, and alsoto warn the reader against blindly accepting unhistorical, andtherefore untruthful, statements.

  Let us now proceed to study Râmâmâtya as a *Vâggêyakâra*, pure and simple.  
  His exact date is not available. Being however a contemporary of Râma Râja, he should have lived in the *sixteenth century*.He was well-versed in Sanskrit and Music; and in Râma Râja's opinion, he was the best of the then existing musicians.He wrote many musical works, such as for instance, Êla,Râgakadamba, Mâthrika, Sudaka, Panchathalêsvara, Sriranga,Dvipada, Svarânka, Srîvilâsa, Dhruva, Pancharatna, and soforth.

  No wonder, then, that Râma Râja—at the instance of hisbrother, Venkatâdri—required Râmâmâtya to write a new workon music. Of this requisition, *Svaramêlakalânidhi* was the result.

**INTRODUCTION**

The colophon¹, at its end, clearly shows that Râmâmâtya finishedhis work in Sâka 1472, Sâdhârana Year, Srâvana Month, and the, tenth day of Nirmalathara (Sukla) Paksha—all of which correspondto Thursday, August 21, 1550 A.D.²  
  Now, be it noted, it was in order to reconcile some conflicting views on music that *Svaramêlakalânidhi* was written, asevidenced by Venkatâdri, in his request to his brother, RâmaRâja :— The science of music has, both in theory and practice,degenerated into conflicting views; let Râmamantri (Râmâmâtya),by your command, reconcile all (the conflicting views) and write a(new) science';³and as confirmed by Râma Râja, in his requisition to Râmâmâtya : 'In the science of music, conflicting viewshave indeed arisen. Bring to a focus all their salient features andwrite an interesting treatise on music, embodying therein itstheory and practice.'⁴  
  Be it, again, noted that, about the same time or withinthe space of about a decade after the publication of *Svaramêlakalânidhi*, Pundarika Vittala finished his *Sadrâgachandrôdaya*.Even in that book, the same note of complaint was sounded that the theory and practice of music did conflict with eachother and that, therefore, Burhan Khan asked Vittala to reconcile them.⁵ Again, in 1609, the self-same note of complaint

was resounded when Sômanâth declared: I write *Râgavibôdha*only to reconcile the conflict between the science and the art of[music](http://रागविबोधं%20विदधे%20विरोधरोधाय%20कक्ष्यलक्षणयोः%20! "रागविबोधं विदधे विरोधरोधाय कक्ष्यलक्षणयोः !").'Even the recently published *Sangithasudha* contains asimilar note of [complaint](http://लक्ष्यस्वरूपे%20हि%20विचिन्त्यमाने%20नानाप्रभेदः%20परिदृश्यते%20हि%20।%20नैकोऽपि%20शास्त्रानुगुणो%20विभाति... "लक्ष्यस्वरूपे हि विचिन्त्यमाने नानाप्रभेदः परिदृश्यते हि । नैकोऽपि शास्त्रानुगुणो विभाति...").  
  A question, therefore, naturally arises, namely, '*Why shouldthe musical views conflict, at all, with one another*?' To put thesame question sarcastically: Why should the *harmonious* musicproduce *disharmony* amongst its votaries?'  
  Because the old order changes, giving place to the new; and,in the transition-period, both the *orders* struggle with each other—the one anxious to get in and the other unwilling to get out.  
  But why should the 'old order' change? In addition toTennyson's philosophical answer, there is here an important truthto be grasped. Into two broad divisions, Sciene falls-*exact*and *non-exact*. The rules of an 'exact' science are inflexible andnever change with the times. H₂O, for instance, was, is, andshall ever be *water* and never anything else. But as regards a'non-exact' science, such as for example Music, it is alwaysprogressive; and, a *fortiori*, its rules do change from time to time,in order to suit the growing taste of the people.  
  Mark! I said from time to time' and not from day to day.For, if music—like dream—changes from day to day; surely, likedream, it will be labelled as mere phantasy and treated as such.Being, however, too momentous for his own welfare, man learntto so mould and fashion music as to make it grow only very slowly and even imperceptibly, as well as to imprint every one of the stages of its growth with its peculiar technique. This position Mr. P. C. Buck explains in his *History of Music* in afelicitous language, which I shall re-state with a little modificationthus: *The various stages of musical progress are not the inventionsof the learned few imposed on, and adopted by, the unlearned many;but rather, a summing-up and organization by the former of those practices and usages at which the latter had arrived by instinct*.

  Hence, the technique of music of a particular age meansand includes the summary of the music of the preceding age*plus* the conventions engrafted, from time to time, upon theoriginal stock, by the masses, as enabling them to attain an idealdimly seen in the distance. A real musician cannot thereforeafford to ignore the aspirations of the people at large, fly at atangent and pooh-pooh the technique of his age which is thenatural growth of years and sometimes of centuries and to which he is tied and bound, whether he wills it or not.  
 It is, however, true that, oft and on, a genius like Thiâgarâjaarises and gives his countrymen not only a summary of the musicof the past but also a programme for the music of the future. Inthat sease, he may be said to have interfered with, and evenchanged or modified, the musical technique of his age. Such a rare exception is due to the fact that the particular ‘gênius' hashad the intuition to see and realise that all the possibilities of thecode of convention, prevailing in his time, had been exhausted;that 'the orange had been sucked dry'; that the period, in whichhe happened to live, had come to a natural end; and that he hadbeen impelled to inaugurate a fresh period, in which the newformula of music arose, as it were, from the ashes of the old.  
 To sum up:The musicians of a particular age stick, underordinary circumstances, to the technique of that age. Extraordinary circumstances occasionally arise when a new age sets inwith a new technique of music. Both the techniques—old andnew—struggle, for a while, after which the old dies and the newflourishes, till a still newer age brings with it its own newertechnique to supplant it. In all these cases of succession, thestruggle between the old and the new techniques lasts only during the transition-periods.  
  It is this inevitable struggle that goes by the name of ‘theconflict of musical views' which, in the nature of things, doesarise from time to time.  
 The same truth Mr. Bhâtkhandê expressed at Lucknow inanother way: ‘Our music has undergone changes, from time totime, according to the tastes of the different ages. We find thesystem propounded in *Sangitharatnâkara* of Shârngadêv is a considerable advance on that described in Bharata's *Nâtyâ Sâstra,* being more exhaustive, more scientific, and expressive of greaternational culture. A mere glance at Lôchana, Pundarika, HridayaNarayana, Ahôbala, and Srinivasa will be enough to show us thatthe systems of music propounded by them mark a still further advance and that they considerably differ from the systems appearing in *Nâtya Sâstra* and *Ratnâkara*. We ourselves are in the twentieth century and the system of music, now in vogue, has left the other systems far behind.'¹

  We are, at this stage, tempted to inquire whether Râmâmâtya recognised the *progressive* nature of music and whether he enunciated, in his work, any principle of guidance, where with he could emphasise the importance of such recognition. A study of *Svaramêlakalânidhi* enables us to answer both the questions in the affirmative. The principle of guidance, spoken of, has already been referred to, though in another connection, but can bear repetition; and it runs as follows: ‘The various stages of musical progress are not the inventions of the learned few imposed on, and adopted by, the unlearned many; but, rather, a summing-up and organisation by the former of those practices and usages at which the latter had arrived by instinct.'

  The idea, conveyed hereby, Shârngadêv first put, in his own way, thus: ‘The learned men are of opinion that the Science follows the Art and must respect the current practice. If any discrepancy arises between the two, the proper procedure is to interpret the science in such a way as it can be reconciled with the practice.² But, unfortunately, he relegated this principle almost to the end—to the sixth chapter—of his work and made it appear as a mere suggestion for any one to take it for what it was worth.

  Râmâmâtya, however, brought it to the forefront of his book and laid such an emphatic stress on it that it developed in his

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  One word of caution is here necessary. The changes, referred to, are in connection with the superstructure of Indian Music, while its foundation or basic principle remains as constant as ever. It is, in fact, this basic *principle* that distinguishes the Indian system from all other systems of music.

     तस्माल्लक्ष्यविरुद्धं यत्तच्छास्त्रं नेयमन्यथा॥**

hands into a star-like maxim for all future writers to follow. Hereis what he wrote on the point: ‘The *Gândharva*-music is everemployed in conformity with the (inflexible) rules of its theory.But if the violation of those theoretical rules, inflexible though, donot lead to any absurdity; and if, again, the contravention of anyof the rules of practice does not give pleasure, but jars, tothe ear; then, the *practice* of music shall be preferred to its *theory*.And it is in conformity with the ‘practical' rules of music (as opposed to its ‘theoretical’ ones) that the *Gâna*-music prevails. In his chapter on *Instruments*, Shârngadêv, well-versedin music-lore, argued that the practice of music was more important than its theory.'  
  If Shârngadêv originated this principle, which may-forfuture guidance-be called ‘the Principle of *Lakshya*'; if, again,Râmâmâtya elaborated and developed it into a maxim; PundarikaVittala chose to condense it into an aphorismic form, namely:-

**लक्ष्यप्रधानं खलु शास्त्रम् ।**  
(*Science only follows Art ; isn't it?*)

  Let us proceed to see how Râmâmâtya applied the principleof *Lakshya* to the development of his musical system.

  Before so doing, we shall first get to know which system ofmusic he took up for study. Even a cursory glance at his workwill show that he referred only to Shârngadêv's system of musicand made it clear that he wanted to modify and bring that system alone in line with the condition of his own times.

  The reason is not far to seek. Almost all the musical worksthat are now coming into prominence, such as for instance, *Sadrágachandrôdaya, Râgavibôdha, Sangithadarpana, Sangithasudha*,

***Svaramêlakalânidhi.***

*Chathurdandiprakasika, Sangithaparijâtha, Sangithasârâmritha,
Nagmut-es-Asphi, Sangithakalpadruma*, and *Lakshyasangith—*all these works came successively one after another, but mark!only *after* the time of *Svaramêlakalânidhi*. And Râmâmâtyahad no other work to criticise before him than Shârngadêv's*Sangitharatnâkara*.

  No doubt, Bharata's *Nâtya Sâstra* and Narada's *Sangithamakaranda* had been in existence long before *Sangitharatnâkara*.But, evidently, Râmâmâtya *did* not mind the former and *could* notmind the latter. For, the one lay involved in a debris at Gadwal,till Mrs. Ananthakrishna Sastri discovered it in 1919 and broughtit to the light of the day; while, the other was a treatise more on dramaturgy than on music.

  Could, then, Lôchanakavi's *Râgatarangini* have come to his notice? We have no definite answer to give. For, the date of*Râgatarangini* is uncertain, in as much as its colophon points to the twelfth century, while its reference to Vidyapati points to thefourteenth century and even later. Even assuming that the bookwas before him, we can easily conjecture that he should havebrushed it aside; for, it was an out-and-out North Indian bookand dealt with the *Hindustani* music.

  Hence Râmâmâtya looked, for guidance, to none elsethan Shârngadêv and even [averred](http://तस्मालक्ष्यप्रधानत्वं%20कृत्वा%20वक्ष्येऽस्य%20लक्षणम्%20। "तस्मालक्ष्यप्रधानत्वं कृत्वा वक्ष्येऽस्य लक्षणम् ।") that he would, like his own chosen guide, make the *Principle of Lakshya* the chief thing inhis book. And he *did* make his averment good. Let us seehow.

  The first point of conflict between Shârngadêv and Râmâmâtya was with reference to the *Sudha-Vikrithá* svaras. At anyrate, both of them agreed with regard to the *Sudha*-svaras andallocated them, alike, thus :-

**A. तत्र तुर्यश्रुतौषड्जः सप्तम्यामृषभो मतः।  
    ततो नवम्यां गान्धारस्त्रयोदश्यां तु मध्यमः॥

***           Sangitharatnâkara.***

**  **The idea conveyed by both A and B, quoted above, is the same and may be stated thus :-  
  ‘The svaras arise from the srutis in such a way that Shadja takes *the 4th sruti* of the Vina, Rishabha *the 7th*, Gândhâra *the 9th*, Madhyama *the 13th,* Panchama *the 17th,* Dhaivatha *the 20th,*and Nishāda *the 22nd*.'  
  The *Sudha*-svaras, which were *common* between Shârngadêv and Râmâmâtya, may be tabulated thus :-

  As regards the *Vikritha*-svaras, both Shârngadêv and Râmâmâtya *differed* from each other. While Shârngadêv presentedto us so many as twelve *Vikritha*-svaras, Râmâmâtya found, *inactual practice*, only seven. He therefore recognised only thoseseven and left out the remaining five.  
  Shârngadêv worked up his twelve *Vikritha*-svaras thus :-  
• The twelve Vikritha Svaras are explained. The four-srutiedShadja becomes two-srutied Vikrithas, namely, Chyutha *Sa* andAchyutha *Sà*. When *Ni* takes the Kaisiki sruti, it is Chyutha ;but when it takes the Kâkali sruti, it is Achyutha. That Rishabha which is four-srutis from Chyutha *Pa* is regarded as a Vikritha.Gândhâra is declared by Shârngadêv to fall into two divisions,three-srutied Sâdhârana and four-srutied Anthara. Madhyama,like Shadja, falls into two divisions viz., Chyutha and Achyutha.Panchama of Madhyamagrâma is three-srutied and has one more variety, namely, four-srutied Kaisiki *Pa*. Dhaivatha, in Madhyamagrâmâ, becomes a four-srutied Vikritha. The three-srutiedNishâda and the four-srutied Nishâda are treated of as Vikrithasof *Sa* and named Kâisiki *Ni* and Kâkali *Ni* respectively.'

  On the other hand, Râmâmâtya worked up his seven *Vikritha*-svaras thus :–  
  'How is it that only seven *Vikritha*-svaras are given here, while Shârngadêv mentioned, in his *Ratnâkara*, so many astwelve ? It is true that, from the theoretical point of view, thenumber twelve may be desirable. But, *in actual practice*, that is,*according to the principle of Lakshya*, there are only seven *Vikritha*-svaras different from the seven *Sudha*-svaras. Ifthe basic notes are left out, there does arise a difference insound, as regards the remaining five Vikritha-svaras. But if they(the basic notes) are retained, the said difference disappears inpractice, though not in theory, by the process of taking thepreceding-but not the next preceding-srutis. I shall tell youhow. *Achyutha-Shadja* does not differ from *Sudha-Shadja*;nor does *Achyutha-Madhyama* differ from *Sudha-Madhyama.* Again, *Vikritha-Rishabha* does not differ from *Sudha-Rishabha*;nor does *Vikritha-Dhaivatha* differ from *Sudha-Dhaivatha*.Further again, *Vikritha-Panchamà* which is taken from *Madhyama-Sruti* does not surely differ from the other *Vikritha- Panchama*. Hence under the category of the above-mentionedfourteen (*Sudha-Vikritha*) svaras, no separate mention was madeof these five svaras, inasmuch as they had effected a merger,as indicated above. We shall enunciate the seven *Vikritha*-svarasby mentioning their names :–

(1) Chyutha Shadja  
(2) Chyutha Madhyama  
(3) Chyutha Panchama  
(4) Sâdhârana Gândhâra  
(5) Anthara Gândhâra  
(6) Kaisiki Nishâda     and  
(7) Kâkali Nishâda.

*  Chyutha Shadja* is the name given to that *Shadja* which gives upits own fourth sruti and takes the third one. The same ruleapplies equally to *Chyutha Madhyama* and *Chyutha Panchama*.When *Sudha-Madhyama* takes the first *Gândhâra*-sruti, it iscalled *Sâdhârana-Gândhâra*; but when the same *Sudha-Madhyama*takes the second *Gândhâra*-sruti, it goes by the name of *AntharaGândhâra*. When, again, *Sudha-Shadja* takes the first *Nishâda*-sruti, it is called (by expert musicians) *Kaisiki Nishâda*; but whenthe same *Sudha-Shadja* takes the second *Nishada*-sruti, it goes bythe name of *Kâkali Nishâda*. Thus, the seven *Vikritha*-svaras have been described’.¹

  1 ‘In fulfilment of a usage, I shall now mention a few different nomenclatures to some of these 14 *Svaras* obtaining elsewhere. On account of itsidentity with Nishâda, Chyutha Shadja is also called *Chyuthâ Shadjâ Nishâda*.On account of its identity with Gândhâra, Chyutha Madhyama is also called*Chyutha Madhyama Gândhâra*. On account of its identity with Madhyama,Chyutha Panchama is also called *Chyutha Panchama Madhyama*. Inasmuchas Rishabha is, *in practice*, known to identify itself with Sudha Gândhâra, thelatter is also called *Panchasruti Rishabha*. When however, Rishabha identifies itself with Sâdhârana Gândhâra, that (Sâdharâna Gandhara) is, *in practice*,also called *Shatsruti Rishabha*. Likewise, when Dhaivatha identifies itselfwith Suddha Nishâda, that Sudha Nishâda is called *Panchasruti Dhaivatha* ;but when it identifies with Kaisiki Nishâda, that Kaisiki Nishâda is calledShatsruti Dhaivata.

***Lakshya***; we shall now proceed to deal with the next question which happens to be five-fold :—

(1) Why were the Sudha-Vikritha svaras so-called ?  
(2) Wherein lay their importance ?  
(3) Are they extant to-day ? If not, why not ?  
(4) What, if any, are their modern proto-types ?  
and (5) What part, if at all, do they now play in actual practice ?  
These five questions we shall now consider.  
First, why were the *Sudha-Vikritha* Svaras so called ?  
No doubt, the time-honored verse, transmitted to us from author to author, namely—

**चतुश्चतुश्चतुश्चैव षड्जमध्यमपञ्चमाः।  
द्वे द्वे निषादगान्धारौत्रिस्त्रीरिषभधैवतौ॥**

sums up ‘the Rule of the ancient *Sudha*-Svaras,' according to which the seven *Sudha*-Svaras were *Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni*, made up—as they were—of 4, 3, 2,4, 4, 3, 2srutis respectively. *Or*, as Râmâmâtya would have it, out of the 22 srutis, numbers 4, 7, 9, 13, 17, 20, 22 were alone spoken of as *Sudha*-svaras ; and they were technically called *Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni,* respectively.[^3]All other numbers were called *Vikritha*-Svaras, of which Râmâmâtya chose seven.  
  But the question is : How did the Sudha-svaras, mentioned above, come to be called *Sudha*-svaras ?  
  One explanation is that those seven svaras—which formed, as they even now form, the scale of Sâmagânam—were called *Sudha*-svaras, because they were used in singing the *pure* music of Sâma-Vêda.  
  There seems, here, to be a confusion of ideas. What did the 'pure' music of Sâma-Vêda indicate—the purity of the *music* or of the *sentiment* expressed thereby ? If the former, what was the standard ? But, if the latter, what connection was there between musical notes and Vedic sentiments ?  
  Another explanation Mr. E. Clements attempted to give. The ancient text-books on music took the Vina-point of view[^4] ;and almost all the ancient terms of music were derived from stringed instruments with frets, which gave a series of semitonesup to a certain point and, then, a scale of tones and semitones.This latter scale (of tones and semitones)was, in the normalposition of the frets, known as the *Sudha*-Scale and the notes itcomprised were called *Sudha*-Svaras[^5].  
  The following tabular statement[^6]of Mr. Bulwant Trimbuckseems to strengthen the position of Mr. Clements :—

[^3]: "1 Vide Fig. 3, page xxi."

[^4]: "सुव्यक्तमेव वीणायामस्यार्थस्य निदर्शनम्   Svaramélakalänidhi."

[^5]: "Cf. Ragas of Tanjore, page 15."

(FIG. 5)

  ‘How delicate and accurate,' remarked Mr. Trimbuck, 'musthave been the organs of hearing of the Aryans, when they couldreach so near the truth, unassisted by the paraphernalia ofthe modern science!’  
  As between these explanations, there emerges a truth that aSvara, according to our ancients, was called *Sudha*, when itremained in its appointed position and was made up of the exactnumber of srutis assigned to it ; that, when it left off any of itssrutis or took any sruti from its preceding or succeeding note,it became a Vikritha-Svara ; and that, sometimes, a *Sudha*-svara,though it retained its own seat, lost its *Sudha*-character andbecame a *Vikritha*, when it lost any of its own srutis and wasthus reduced in value.  
  Finally, just as in Western Music, though a scale may beformed in more ways than one, namely:

(1) 1, $\\frac{9}{8}$,$\\frac{5}{4}$,$\\frac{4}{3}$,$\\frac{3}{2}$,$\\frac{5}{3}$,$\\frac{15}{8}$, 2;  

(2) 1, $\\frac{9}{8}$, $\\frac{6}{5}$, $\\frac{4}{3}$, $\\frac{3}{2}$, $\\frac{5}{3}$, $\\frac{15}{8}$, 2;  

(3) 1, $\\frac{9}{8}$, $\\frac{6}{5}$, $\\frac{4}{3}$, $\\frac{3}{2}$, $\\frac{8}{5}$, $\\frac{9}{5}$, 2;  

(4) 1, $\\frac{9}{8}$, $\\frac{81}{64}$, $\\frac{4}{3}$, $\\frac{3}{2}$, $\\frac{27}{16}$, $\\frac{243}{128}$, 2;

yet, the first scale alone is held to be important and ever brought into the forefront for any kind of musical discussion ; so too, inIndian Music, from amidst a variety of its scales, the *Sudha*-Scalealone was considered to be important and was, in fact, constitutedto be the basis of the ancient Indian musical system.  
  Secondly, we shall determine the importance of the *Sudha*-svaras and of the *Sudha*-scale formed thereby. I may state it, asa general rule, that just as a tourist, on entering a new country,finds it convenient, nay, necessary to study its language with aview to understand the real nature of that country ; so too, a music-student, on opening any one of our ancient books on music, finds it convenient, nay, necessary to study the *terms* or phraseology employed therein, with a view to understand the real natureof the *Râga System ¹*which its author finally built. A mereglance at those texts will show that one and all their authors spoke of their Râgas only in terms of *Sudha*-svaras and alsoemployed therein the *Sudha-Vikritha* phraseology. Take, forinstance, *Srirâga*, of which Râmâmâtya wrote :— ‘The Mêla of*Srirâga* consists of these seven svaras, namely, *Sudha Sa, Panchasruti Ri, Sâdhârana Ga, Sudha Ma, Sudha Pa, Pancha-sruti Dha and Kaisiki Ni.*²Surely, none could understand thiskind of description without a previous knowledge of the meaningof the terms employed therein. Hence, the *Sudha-Vikritha*Svaras of our ancient authors formed, as it were, a key to open,and see for ourselves, the rich treasures of their musical systems.  
  Are those ancient *Sudha-Vikritha* Svaras extant to-day ? Ifnot, why not ? What, if any, are their modern prototypes ? Whatpart, if at all, do they now play in actual practice ?  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  1Râga was, as it even now is, the soul of Indian Music. The *Srutis*,the *Svaras*, and even the *Mêlas* form so many means, while the *Râgas* aloneform the end. Even the compositions and their various types are so many*Râga-manifestations,* perhaps with the additional elements of rhythm andpoetry. Hence the determination of the *Râgas* and their *Lakshanas* formsthe main, if not the sole, portion of our musical system.

*                     Svaramêlakalânidhi.***

  These questions may be grouped together and discussed as such.  
 Now, the ancient *Sudha-Vikritha* Svaras are not extantto-day. Because, according to Mr. Clements's opinion, they hadbeen looked at only from the Vina-point of view, while theirmodern prototypes have had an entirely different principle tostand upon ; because the ancient *Sudha-Vikritha* system wasbased upon *Bharata Matha* which had 'Dha' for keynote, whileits modern prototype has been based on *Hanumanta Matha* whichhas' Sa' for keynote ; because, in Bharata Matha, the frets were somoved and adjusted as to give the exact scale required, while, in Hanumanta Matha, the increase of tension is one of the chiefmeans of getting the right notes ; and lastly because the *Sudha-Vikritha* system allowed itself to be differently interpreted, whileits modern prototype has only one interpretation to view it with.  
  The last reason requires explanation. Three differentauthors, Râmâmâtya, Ahôbala, and Bhâtkhandê, chose the same*Sudha*-Svaras, from Fig. 3, for their *Sudha*-scales and, yet, arrivedat three different *Râgas*, viz., Mukhâri, Kâphi, and Bilâval whichare said to respectively correspond to Kanakângi, Kharaharapriya  
and Sankarâbharanam of the Carnatic Music.¹  
  A question, at once, arises as to why the self-same *Sudha*-scale, formed out of *Sa* (4th sruti), *Ri* (7th), *Ga* (9th), *Ma* (13th),*Pa* (17th), *Dha* (20th), and *Ni* (22nd) gave rise to three different*Râgas*.  
  Mr. D. K. Joshi made an attempt to answer it and observed :‘Suppose a man in Bombay buys a seer of sugar and a manin Poona buys a seer of sugar ; they will find that the quantitiesof sugar, though identical in having the name *seer*, in each case

differed in their weight—Bombay *seer* weighing 28 Tolas and Poona *seer* 76 Tolas. If the quantities of sugar differed in theirvalue or weight, why should they be identical in having the samename *seer* ? The answer to this question is sure to satisfy thequestion suggested in our case. And I think the answer, in boththe cases, is one and the same. It is *Convention'*. ¹  
  Apart from the vibrational values ² which Mr. Joshi gave eachof the *Sudha*-Svaras of each of the three authors he selected, theanalogy, that he took, seems to be a little unhappy and does not,I fear, strengthen his position. In the case of *seers*, there is aclear difference, according to Mr. Joshi, of 48 Tolas betweenBombay and Poona. Even in South India, there is a widedifference, in quantity, between the *measures* of Madras andCoimbatore. Whereas, in the *seer* or *measure*, there is the sameness only in name but not in quantity ; in the *Sudha*-Scale, therewas the sameness not only in name but also in quantity. For,whether the Râga that emanated was Kanakângi, Kharaharapriya,or Sankarâbharanam, the original stock of the *Sudha*-Scale gave*Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni* respectively srutis 4, 3, 2, 4, 4, 3, 2.Unless, therefore, the 4th sruti—to take one for example—doesnot mean only the 4th sruti but also anything above or below, noclue presents itself to explain why three different Râgas were saidto emanate from one and the same *Sudha*-Scale.  
  From all standpoints of view, the ancient theory of *Sudha*-Scale was given up, as being practically useless for the modernrequirements.  
 To-day there is no scale, called *Sudha*-Scale, unless the first*Mêla* of Venkatamakhi's System counts for such. Even that firstMêla (Kanakângi), had to give way to Purandra Das's *Mâyâ-mâlavagowla* which the very Râmâmâtya proclaimed in his book,as 'the best of all Râgas'.  
 Of this ‘Mâyâmâlavagowla,' Mr. Clements remarked: 'Iam not in favour of Sankarâbharanam as the *Sudha*-Scale. Unscientific writers put Bihag in the same family. We do not wantany ambiguity in our *Sudha*-Scale. Mâyâmâlavagowla is entirely

free from this defect. Further, to adopt the Mâyâmâlavagowla-scale as the *Sudha*-Scale does no violence to the feelings of themusicians[^7].Here came Mr. A. H. Fox Strangways, as it were,to help Mr. Clements and observed : *'Mâyâmâlavagowla* onlydeveloped from *Mukhâri* by way of modal shift of tonic, as in thecase of the modern Greek Scale[^8].And here, again, Mr.H. A. Popley amplified that the modal shift of tonic was made byone semitone higher and, having illustrated his point by thefollowing diagram

wrote, by way of explanation,—'B to B form *Mukhari* and C to Cis *Mâyâmâlavagowla*[^9] ¹.  
  All the three, I fear, overshot the mark, inasmuch as the*Mukhâri* of the above Fig. 6 points only to *Kharaharapriya*wherein alone *Ga* (D) and *Ni* (A) are *Kômal* or flat and surelynot to *Kanakângi*, wherein *Ga* and *Ni* are really conspicuous bytheir absence, though *Ri* Thivra and *Dha* Thivra are made tofalsely personate them.  
  The trend of the modern view is that, while *Bilâvâl* is the*Sudha*-Scale of North India, *Mâyâmâlavagowla* is that of SouthIndia. But, be it noted, that neither of them is the *Sudha*-Scalein the sense in which our ancient writers held, viz, that its sevensvaras had their respective sruti numbers 4, 7, 9, 13, 17, 20 and22, but that the elementary songs have been traditionally taughtto the children in those *Râgâs*. Such *traditional* teaching began,at first, as a matter of convenience or, better, inclination ; but,then, it took root by force of habit.  
  Now, though the old seven *Sudha*-Svaras and the *Sudha*-Scale formed thereby have, doubtless, become obsolete ; yet, we have

  4 It may be that Purandra Dâs wanted that the beginners of music should not be troubled with the controversial svaras (*Ri₂*or Sudha *Ga*), (*Ga₁*or Shatsruti *Ri*), (*Dha₂* or Sudha *Ni*), and (*Ni₁*or Shatsruti *Dha*) but should be confined, at the outset, only to the non-controversial svaras (*Ri₁*and *Ga₂*) (*Dha₁*and *Ni₂*) and also Sudha *Ma.*

now *Sa* and *Pa* as *Sudha* (or better, *Prakrithi*) Svaras, inasmuchas they are fixed or admit of no varieties at all ; while *Ri, Ga, Ma,Dha, Ni* are *Vikritha*-Svaras, inasmuch as each of them admits oftwo[^10]clear varieties, viz, *Kômal* and *Thîvra*, that is, flat and sharp.These modern '*Sudha-Vikritha* Svaras, twelve[^11]in number, maybe tabulated thus :—

[^10]: "A third variety is added by Venkatamakhi."

(FIG. 7)

  And, again, these modern *Sudha-Vikritha* Svaras enable usto formulate, according to the Principle of *Lakshya*, the followingworking scheme which may be styled *Laghumêakartha* (लघुमेलकर्ता)as distinguished from the *Brihanmêlakartha* (बृहन्मेलकर्ता) of Venkatamakhi :—

[TABLE]

(FIG. 8)  

  In order to be able to compare the *Mêlas* of Fig. 8 withthose of Râmâmâtya, it is desirable that we should, first, knowhow Fig. 8 was worked up and, secondly, learn how the *Mêlas* of*Svaramêlakalânidhi* were formulated.  
  Now, *Ri* and *Ga* may be combined in four different ways,*viz*, (1) Ri₁and Ga₁ (2) Ri₁ and Ga₂ (3) Ri₂ and Ga₁and (4) Ri₂and Ga*2*.Similarly *Dha* and *Ni* may be combined in fourdifferent ways. By tacking the four varieties of *Dha* and *Ni* toeach of the four varieties of *Ri* and *Ga*, we have sixteen varietiesof *Ri, Ga, Dha*, and *Ni*. These sixteen varieties, when furthermanipulated with the two varieties of *Ma*, yield thirty-two¹working *Mêlas*, for which see Fig. 8, where it will be seen that *Melas*1 to 16 are *Sudha*-Madhyama or *Poorva Mêlas*, while *Mélas* 17 to32 are *Prathi*-Madhyama or *Uthara Mêlas.*  
  Râmâmâtya, on the other hand, merely specified the namesof his *Twenty Mêlas* and stopped with explaining their characteristics. Here is what he wrote :

**लक्षणं वक्ष्यते पश्चादुद्देशः क्रियतेऽधुना।  
सर्वेषु रागमेलेषु मुखारीमेलआदिमः॥**

**ततो मालवगौलस्य मेलः श्रीरागमेलकः।

**शुद्धरामक्रियामेलो देशाक्षीमेलकोऽपरः।

**आंहरीमेलकश्चैव नादरामक्रिया परः।

^(\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_)  
  1 Even the *Katapayadi-Sankhya* seems to point to 32 as being theoriginal number of the prime-*Râgas* (or M*ê*las) ; inasmuch as *Ra* (रा)represents 2, and *Ga* (ग) represents 3, and therefore Râga (राग) represents,according to the said formula, 32.

**मेलः सामवराल्याश्चरेवगुप्तेश्च मेलकः।  
सामन्तनाममेलश्चकाम्भोजीमेलकस्ततः॥**  
**मेला** **विंशतिरेवैते॥¹**

And continued Râmâmâtya :—

**तेषां लक्षणमुच्यते।  
शुद्धसप्तस्वरैर्युक्तो मुखारीमेलको** **भवेत्॥²**

  In this way Râmâmâtya went on. Evidently he did not care to deduce his twenty *Mêlas* from any kind of *principles*, but perhapsrecorded such of the *Mêlas* as were in vogue during his time.  
  Even in so doing, he happened to slip into a palpable mistakeof giving the same identical characteristics to two of his twenty*Mêlas*, viz., *Sâranganâta* and *Kêdâragowla* thus :—

[TABLE]

(FIG. 9)

  The veriest tyro will not fail to note the identical samenessin the characteristics of both the *Mêlas* in Fig. 9. Inasmuch,therefore, as *Sâranganâta* and *Kêdâragowla* merged, in point of

  1 ‘I shall now specify the names (of the Mêlas) and then explain their characteristics. Of all the Mêlas, *Mukhâri* is the first. Other Mêlas are as follows : — *Mâlavagowla, Srrirâga, Sâranganâta,* *Hindôla,* *Sudharâmakriya, Desâkshi, Kannadagowla, Sudhanâti, Âhari, Nâdarâmakriya, Sudhavarâli, Rithigowla, Vasanthabhairavi, Kêdâragowla, Hêjujji, Sâmavarâli, Rêvagupthi, Sâmantha,* and *Kâmbhôji.* Thus there are twenty *Mêlas*.'  
 2‘And their characteristics are explained thus : the *Mêla* of *Mukhâri,* for instance, consists of seven *Sudha-svaras*.'

their characteristics, into one ; how could Râmâmâtya counttwenty different *Mêlas*?Quickly, therefore, did Venkatamakhihasten to lash him on this vulnerable point and wrote :

**त्वदुक्तरीत्या सारङ्गनाटकेदारगौलयोः।  
संप्राप्तमेकमेलत्वं मेलाः स्युर्विंशतिः कथम् ॥¹**

  Nor did Venkatamakhi stop here. But he proceeded toattack Râmâmâtya, using even rough language, on *nine* morepoints. We shall deal with them, one by one, and place theviews, thereon, of both Râmâmâtya and Venkatamakhi in juxta-position :—

(1) As regards some derivatives of  
*‘SRIRÂGA MÊLA.'*

  *Râmâmâtya*.—The *Mêla* of *Srirâga* consists of these seven *Svaras*,viz., *Sudha Sa, Panchasruti Ri, Sâdhârana Ga, Sudha Ma, Sudha Pa,Panchasruti Dha,* and *Kaisiki Ni.* Then do I enumerate some of the*Râgas* derived from this *Mêla*, and they are :—*Srirâga, Bhairavi, Gowli,Dhanyâsi, Sudhabhairavi, Vêlâvali, Mâlavasri, Sankarâbharanam, Andôli,Dêvagandhâri,* and *Madhyamêdi.'* ²  
  *Venkatamakhi*.— You said that *Bhairavi*, *Sankarâbharanam*, and *Gowli*were derived from *Srirâga Mela.* Inasmuch as *Bhairavi* has *Sudha* *Dha*,*Sankarâbharanam* has *Anthara Ga*, and *Gowli* has *Kâkali Ni*, and inasmuch

as (the last mentioned) *Gowli* may (rightly) be derived from *Mâlavagowla*,how can you (dare to) say that these *Râgas* were derived from the*Mêla* of *Srirâga* ? O ! Râma ! Râma ! Râma !. How confused (is yourhead) !!!’¹

(2) As regards some derivates of  
*‘SUDHARAMAKRIYA MÊLA'*

  *Râmâmâtya*—‘Some of the *Râgas* derived from the *Mêla* of *Sudharâmakriya* are :— *Sudharâmakriya, Pâdi, Ardradêsi*, and *Dipaka*.²  
  *Venkatamakhi*.— 'Inasmuch as you (wrongly) said that *Pâdi* and *Ardradêsi* were derived from *Sudharâmakriya*, and inasmuch as the truth is thatthey were derived from the *Mêla* of *Gowla*, O ! Râma, you have committeda great sin, to remove which, you should contemplate the name of (thatgreat) Râma.’³

**(3)** As regards the Mêla of  
*'KANNADAGOWLA.'*

*  Râmâmâtya*.*-* As between the characteristics of *Dêsâkshi and Kannadagowla,*there is one point of difference, viz., the latter (*Kannadagowla*) has *Kaisiki Ni*, as practised by the experts (instead of *Chyutha Shadja Ni of Dêsâkshi*).'1  
* Venkatamakhi*.– ‘The statement that *Dêsâkshi,* when it attains *Kaisiki Ni*, becomes *Kannadagowla* leads to an absurdity. The fact is that *Kannadagowla* belongs to the *Mêla* of *Srirâga’*.²

**(9)** As regards  
*‘KÂMBHÔJI.’*

*  Râmâmâtya*.- ‘The *Mêla* of *Kâmbhôji* consists of these *Svaras,* viz., *Sudha Sa, Panchasruti Ri, Anthara Ga, Sudha Ma, Sudha Pa, Panchasruti Dha,* and *Kâkali Ni.'* ¹  
* Venkatamakhi*.- ‘Does not even the maid-servant of a Vainika know that *Kâmbhôji* has *Kaisiki* (and not *Kâkali*) *Ni?'* ²  
  The reader will, at this stage, do well to guard himself against entertaining any mistaken notion that Râmâmâtya was all wrong or that Venkatamakhi was all right. He will further do well to remember that, between *Svaramêlakalânidhi* and *Chathurdandiprakâsika*, there elapsed a *full* century and a little more; that the musical systems, worked out in both the books, must-on account of the *progressive* nature of the art-be necessarily different from each other; and that some of the views of both the authors might therefore be right and wrong-*right* in their own times, and *wrong* in other times.  
 Living, as I do, three centuries after Venkatamakhi who insisted on having only Kaisiki *Ni* for *Kâmbhôji,* I may repay the author of *Chathurdandiprakâsika* in his own coin and retort: 'Does not even the cook of a Vainika know that the *Kâmbhôji* of the present day has not only Kaisiki *Ni* but also Kâkali *Ni,* as in the case of the phrase *Sa-Ni-Pa-Dha-Sa?* Again, in your chapter on *Râgas*, you dared to write-

**कांभोजीरागः संपूर्णोऽप्यारोहे मनि वर्जितः ।³**

  From this heinous sin, O ! Venkata, you cannot escape even though you go on a pilgrimage to Tirupati, the abode of Lord Venkateswara. For, whether your *Kâmbhôji*corresponds to our

     ³*Cf*. *Kâmbhôji Râga*, though *Sampurna,* leaves out in the ascent *Ma*and *Ni.*

*Kâmbhôji* or *Harikâmbhôji,* *Ma* is never left out, though *Kâmbhôji* leaves out *Ni* in the ascent.'  
 Surely, then, Venkatamakhi threw stones at Râmâmâtya, while himself was living in a glass-house;¹and his strictures on *Svaramêlakalânidhi* are unjust, uncalled-for, and even offensive to a degree.  
 Still, a Venkata may persist in reminding us as to why Râmâmâtya, having merged, into one, *Sâranganâta* and *Kêdâragowla*, ventured to count twenty *Mêlas*? This, as I said, is no doubt a vulnerable point. But be it, at the same time, noted that, during the long period of a full century, after which Venkatamakhi criticised it, Heaven alone knows what changes or modifications the manuscripts of *Svaramêlakalânidhi* underwent in the hands of different indifferent copyists and what sort of a copy finally fell into our critic's hands. Even assuming that Râmâmâtya committed the blunder attributed to him, I am disposed to think that it is a matter only of a slip of the pen and that he had no time to revise what he wrote. For, does not Fig. **II** show that the *Graha, Amsa*, and *Nyâsa*, as well as the time of singing, of both *Sâranganâta* and *Kêdâragowla* are quite different from each other?  
 I said that Râmâmâtya did not care to deduce his *Mêlas* from any kind of *principles* but perhaps recorded such of the *Mêlas* as were in vogue during his time.  
 My view seems to be confirmed, when we note, that, at the end of his fourth chapter on *Mêla*, Râmâmâtya felt that, in actual practice,[^12]Anthara *Ga* and Kâkali *Ni* were not only of very small or occasional use but also were represented³by Chyutha

[^12]: "That is, according to the Principle of Lakshya."

** 1**Surely, Venkatamakhi did live in a *glass-house*; for, did he not solemnly record, in his book, without any attempt on his part to inquire, a mere *hearsay*-matter, which turned out to be altogether false? In his *Râgaprakarana*, he stated**रागास्तावद्दशविधा भरताद्यैरुदीरिताः॥**, that is, 'Bharata and others say that *Râgas* are of ten kinds.' But in Bharata's *Nâtya Sâstra*, there is no mention of the word *Râga* at all, much less of its ten kinds !

***³Cf*. अन्तरस्य च काकल्या ग्राह्यः प्रतिनिधिः क्रमात्।  
    च्युतमध्यमगांधारश्च्युतषड्जनिषादकः॥**

***Svaramêlakalânidhi***

madhyama *Ga* and Chyuthapanchama *Ni* respectively, and, therefore, chose to reduce, as an alternative, his twenty-into fifteen-*Mêlas,* and also stated that the remaining five must be deemed to be implied in the fifteen. To illustrate, Hejujji must be deemed to be implied in Vasanthabhairavi; Sâmavarâli, in Sudhavarâli; Rêvagupthi, in Bowli; Sâmantha, in Kannadagowla; and Kâmbhôji, in Sâranganâta.¹

 Further, the recognition of the theory of *representation*, referred to, is tantamount to almost identifying Chyuthamadhyama *Ga* and Chyuthashadja *Ni* respectively with Anthara *Ga* and Kâkali *Ni* and also to driving, out of the field, one of the two pairs of svaras, preferably the latter.  
 As regards *Râgas*, Râmâmâtya divided them into three kinds-*Superior,* *Middling,* and *Inferior*. The ‘superior' Râgas are said to have been free from any kind of mixture and also suitable for singing, composition, elaboration and for Tâya; and they were twenty in all. The ‘middling' Râgas were employed to sing fragmentary portions of songs and were fifteen in all; while, the ‘inferior' Râgas, plentiful though, were calculated to dazzle (and not illumine) the masses and were \[dis-\] regarded as being unsuitable for compositions.

 These three divisions were once repeated by Sômanâth in his *Râgavibôdha*; but they disappeared from the time of Venkatamakhi, with the result that they are unknown to, and unrecognized by, the modern musicians. For, which musician of to-day will reconcile himself to blackmark and taboo, for instance, *Sankarâbharana*-unless it be that it does not tally with our

(FIG. 13)

 In the above Fig. 13, Mâyamâlavagowla occurs twice and Sankarâbharana thrice ! If Râmâmâtya had given Kaisiki *Ni* to Kâmbhôji, we could have interpreted that Râga in terms of the modern Harikâmbhôji. But he chose to give it Kâkali *Ni* !! We feel puzzled.  
 Again, as regards the twenty-three Derivative Râgas delineated in Fig. 12, most of his arrangement seems to have been upset by his successors. Though, for instance, *Lalitha, Sourashtra* and the like are, even now, retained under the same category as Râmâmâtya's; most of the other Râgas, such as for instance, *Sâvêri, Dhanyâsi* and the like, have been made to change their categories. Further, what did Râmâmâtya mean by proclaiming *Bhairavi* and*Sankarâbharana* to be each a Sampurna and, yet, a derivative of *Srirâga,* which was (also as it ought to have been) a Sampurna? Furthermore, Râmâmâtya's *Srirâga* corresponds, as per Fig. 13, to the modern *Kharaharapriya*. Could, then, Bhairavi or Sankarâbharana come out of Kharaharapriya? We feel, again, puzzled.  
 There, yet, appears a way-out. Gentle reader, follow.  
 In the first place, I would put you in mind of what I had said in connection with Venkatamakhi's unwarranted onslaught on Râmâmâtya, namely, *Heaven knows what changes or modifications the manuscripts of ‘Svaramêlakalânidhi' underwent in the hands of different indifferent copyists and what sort of a copy finally fell into our-own-hands*. In the second place, the names of the Râgas and, for that matter, of the Thâlas, of the Svaras, and of even the 22 Srutis—have been from time to time changing, like chameleon's colour. Here are, for instance, two sets of names, given in two different periods of time, to one and the same time-honored 22 Srutis, wherein all the names differ, except Ugra, even which figures itself in the 7th Sruti in the one case and in the 21st Sruti in the other :—

(FIG. 14).

 Hence, Râmâmâtya's *Sankarâbharana* is not the modern Sankarâbharana; nor is his *Bhairavi* or even *Srirâga* our own. The only sensible inference, that we can draw under the circumstances, is that we should not allow ourselves to be \[mis-\] led by the mere *names* of Râmâmâtya's Râgas but should delve deep and study the *characteristics* of each of them and find out its modern prototype and its modern name as well.

 Will a study of Râmâmâtya's *Vîna* help us to understand his Râga-system, especially as he assures us it would? Let us, then, take up the subject of *Vina*, which Râmâmâtya dealt with, in his third chapter, at the very outset of which he emphasised the importance of Vîna, as creating a nice taste for, and a fine discrimination in, Srutis, Svaras, Mêlas, and Râgas; besides being a means of attaining Dharma, Artha, Kâma, and Môksha.  
 Be it noted that Râmâmâtya fundamentally differed from Shârngadêv in the matter of constructing his *Vîna* and thereby cut a new path for his successors to follow. While Shârngadêv presented to us a Vîna of twenty-two strings; Râmâmâtya simplified the process by requiring only four strings to produce all his *Sudha-Vikritha* svaras in all the three registers. While, again, Shârngadêv's Vîna was only of two kinds, viz., *Sruti Vîna* and *Svara* *Vina;* Râmâmâtya's Vîna was of six kinds, which may conveniently be tabulated thus :—

<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-16912454071.jpg"/>

  All the six kinds of Râmâmâtya's Vîna were provided with frets. In the *Sarvarâga Mêla Vîna,* they were fixed and immovable, as in the case of our modern *Tanjore Vîna;* while, in the *Êkarâga Mêla Vîna*, they were not fixed and therefore movable, as in the case of the modern *Sitar* of North India. In fact, the frets of the latter kind were moved or changed every time a Râga was changed; while, those of the former kind were fixed andyet made to produce all the Râgas in all the registers. Hence their respective names.  
 As for the construction and characteristics of Râmâmâtya's Vîna; first, there was a Cross-Bar, called *Danda*, on the left-hand side of which there was a Gourd, called *Thumba*, attached thereto by means of a round piece of metal, called *Nâbhi*. Over and along the cross-bar, four metallic wires were fastened between the left-hand bridge, called *Mêru,* and the right-hand piece of wood at the end of the cross-bar, called *Kakubha*; and these (four) wires were also made to run over a metallic piece, on the right-hand side, called *Pathrikâ*. The *Dôraka*-strings intervened between Pathrikâ and Kakubha and held the four wires tightly from the basis of the latter; while, bits of cotton (or woollen or even silken) threads, called *Jiva,* were used over the Pathrika and under the (four) wires, with a view to refine the sound. All over the cross-bar but underneath the (four) wires were placed metallic frets, called, *Sârikas*, by means of which alone proper sounds could be produced on the (four) wires. Below the cross-bar, but near the four wires and on the right-hand side, three additional wires were fastened for *Sruti*-purposes.

 What *Svaras* did each of the four upper-wires and of the three lower-wires speak, when sounded? The answer depends on whether the Vîna was Sudha Mêla, Madhya Mêla, or Achyutha- râjêndra Mêla. For, while the order of the three lower-wires was the same in all the three kinds of the Vîna, namely, Madhya *Sa,* Mandra *Pa*, and Mandra *Sa,* except an additional Madhya *Pa* was tacked on to the lower-wires of the third kind of the Vîna; the order of the four upper-wires, in *Sudha Mêla Vina*, was:- Anumandra *Sa,* Anumandra *Pa*, Mandra *Sa,* and Mandra *Ma;* that, in *Madhya Mêla Vîna,* was:-Anumandra *Pa*, Mandra *Sa*, Mandra *Pa*, and Madhya *Sa* ; and that, in *Achyutharâjêndra Mêla Vina*, was:Anumandra *Sa,* Anumandra *Pa,* Mandra *Sa*, and Mandra *Pa.*  
 Confining, now, our attention to the Sudha Mêla Vîna, we note that, over its cross-bar, six frets were placed in such a manner as they produced, *in order*, by *the first (Anumandra Sa-) wire*, the following svaras :-

  Even for other registers, such as, *Madhyathâra* and *Anuthâra*, the same method was pursued and suitable frets were fixed. But, be it remembered, in those higher registers, the only wire that could possibly produce sweet or agreeable svaras was the *fourth* and not any of the other three upper-wires.  
 Be it also remembered that Sudha *Sa* and Sudha *Ri* of the second-wire occurred again on the third and were therefore of no use on the second and that, similarly, Sudha *Ma* and Chyuthapanchama *Ma* of the third wire occurred again on the fourth and were therefore of no use on the third.  
 Finally, Râmâmâtya made reference to what were called *Svayambhus*, which were self-produced svaras or which, in the language of Râmâmâtya himself, ‘emanated of their own accord[^13].'Could Râmâmâtya's ‘Svayambhus' be the same as what, in Physics, is known as the Harmonics,' inasmuch as even the latter emanate of their own accord? It is said that, while there are more ways than one to hear the *Harmonics* on a string, only one of them is implied by the term *Svayambhus*. How far this statement is true can be judged only by studying the Harmonics, at first, and by seeing whether and, if so, how far they tally with the Svayambhus.  
 What are the *Harmonics?* If you strike a string of any instrument—provided it is in a proper state of tension—you will observe that it vibrates not only in its entire length but also in segments. All these motions are simultaneous and the soundsproceeding therefrom are blended into one note. The fundamental *Sa*, that is struck, is the loudest and is called the *prime* or the *prime* *partial tone*, while others are called the *upper partial tones* or the *overtones;* and the whole series of the upper partial tones form the *Harmonics*.  
 The first upper partial tone is the higher octave of the fundamental *Sa* and makes twice as many vibrations as the prime in the same time; and it is *Så.* The second upper partial tone is the fifth of the octave *Sa* and makes thrice as many vibrations as the prime in the same time; and it is *På.* The third upper partial tone is the second higher octave and makes four times as many vibrations as the prime in the same time; and it is *Sä*. The fourth upper partial tone is the major third of the second octave and makes five times as many vibrations as the prime in the same time; and it is *Gä.* The fifth upper partial tone is the fifth of the second octave and makes six times as many vibrations as the prime in the same time; and it is *Pä*. And so on and on. Thus, the relative numbers of the vibrations which make the *Harmonic Series* of sounds, are as 1: 2: 3: 4: 5: 6 and so on. You can hear this series in the wire of any instrument—say, of the sonometre—if you vibrate it after it has been successively shortened, , $\\frac{1}{2}$,$\\frac{1}{3}$,$\\frac{1}{4}$,$\\frac{1}{5}$,$\\frac{1}{6}$etc., of its whole length.  
 But the point to be remembered is what we, in this connection, began with. If a wire is struck, it vibrates not only in its whole length but also in its aliquot parts.. In other words, if you, by striking a wire, produce the fundamental *Sa*; all the upper partial tones, mentioned above, namely,

[^13]: "स्वयंभुवः स्वराः ह्येते न खबुद्ध्या प्रकल्पिताः ।  Svaramêlakalânidhi."

* Sȧ—Pȧ—Sä—Gä—Pä*, etc., etc.  
are simultaneously produced on the same wire by a *natural* process. A trained ear will surely detect the upper partial tones, sounding of their own accord and blending with the prime or fundamental *Sa—*at least the first few partials which are loud enough to be heard, if not the other ones which become fainter and fainter as they rise higher and higher in pitch.  
 We, thus, find that the striking of a wire, the production thereby of the fundamental *Sa* and the detection, with a trained ear, of the upper partial tones which sound of their own accord by a natural process on the same wire—all these jointly form the first or *natural* way to hear, and thereby recognize the existence of, the *Harmonics.*

 It is not, however, impossible to *artificially* produce and distinctly hear each of the upper partial tones. If, for instance, you strike a wire and touch the said wire at its middle with your finger (or better still with a feather); you will distinctly hear the higher octave of the fundamental *Sa*. Other upper partial tones may similarly be produced by touching the said wire at a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth and so on, of its length.

 There is, yet, a third way of hearing the Harmonics. Stretch, for instance, the two wires—A and B—of a sonometre and tune them to *exact* unison. Place, then, a moveable bridge underneath the wire B, so as to gently touch it at its middle point and to produce, if vibrated, the first upper partial tone, namely, the octave *Så*. Now, set the whole wire A in vibration and make it produce the fundamental *Sa.* You will note that even the neighbouring wire B, though untouched, vibrates of its own accord and produces the harmonic first higher octave *Sà*. This remarkable fact that a vibrating body may cause another elastic body, in tune with it, also to vibrate is called the *Co-vibration.*  
 We are, now, in a position to arrive at the following conclusions regarding the *Harmonics* :—  
 (1) The Harmonics co-exist, in nature, with the note of a string.  
  (2) Those Harmonics may be heard in more ways**^(I)**than one, such as for instance :—  
 (a) Hearing the fundamental *Sa*, struck in the wire of any instrument—provided it is in a proper state of tension—along with its naturally-arising upper partials, all in a happy blending;

  or (b) Striking the wire and at the same time touching it at a half, a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth and so on, of its length and hearing the corresponding upper partials, in order, as well as separately;  
 or (c) Striking one of the two wires of a sonometre, both of them being tuned to exact unison, and touching the other wire at a half, a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth and so on, of its length and hearing the corresponding upper partials by virtue of the co-vibration.

**————————————————————————————————————**

  1 In every one of those ways, only the first few partials will be loud and heard, while the other ones become fainter as they rise higher in pitch.

 Before we proceed to compare the ‘Harmonics' with the ‘Svayambhus,' we will do well to study the connotation imported into the term *Svayambhu* by Râmâmâtya. And on this point, I shall let Râmâmâtya himself speak :-  
 ‘The Mandra Sudha *Pa*, produced on the fourth wire by the second fret is called Svayambhu. Hence all the svaras produced (on all the four wires) by the second fret are Svayambhus and cannot be otherwise. Inasmuch as the Anumandra Sudha *Ni*, produced on the second wire by the second fret, is of the same value as the Mandra Sudha *Ni*, produced on the fourth wire by the fourth fret; all the svaras, produced (on all the four wires) by the fourth fret are determined to be Svayambhus; and they cannot be otherwise. Inasmuch, again, as the Anumandra Chyuthashadja *Ni*, produced on the second wire by the fourth fret, is of the same value as the Mandra Chyuthashadja *Ni*, produced on the fourth wire by the sixth fret; all the svaras produced (on all the four wires) by the sixth fret are determined to be Svayambhus; and they cannot be otherwise. The *Sa-Ma* svaras, produced (on the first three wires) by the fifth fret are all Svayambhus. Inasmuch, again, as the Mandra Kaisiki *Ni*, produced on the fourth wire by the fifth fret, is of the same value as the Anumandra Kaisiki *Ni*, produced on the second wire by the third fret; all the svaras, produced (on all the wires) by the third fret are Svayambhus. Inasmuch, further again, as the Mandra Sudha *Dha*, produced on the fourth wire by the third fret is of the same value as the Anumandra Sudha *Dha*, produced on the second wire by the first fret; all the svaras have been shewn to be of definitely determined values. In this manner Râmâmâtya determined the values of all the svaras produced on all the four wires by all the six frets.'^(**1**)

  In so many words, Râmâmâtya meant to drive home to his reader's mind that, among the twenty-four svaras, compressed in all the six frets on all the four upper-wires of his Vîna, very many pairs would, on close scrutiny, be found to be related to each

other as the fundamental or prime tone would be to its upper partial tone; such as for instance, the Sudha *Dha* in the first fret on the second wire to the Sudha *Dha* in the third fret on the fourth wire.  
  Evidently, therefore, Râmâmâtya's *Svayambhus* had a close affinity with the *Harmonics,* inasmuch as the former belonged to the second, and perhaps even third, category of the latter, mentioned above. Further, does not Râmâmâtya's method of merely tuning the four upper-wires, as well as the three lowerwires, of his Vîna into Sa—Pa—Sa—Ma, on the one hand, and into Sa—Pa—Sa, on the other, testify to the fact that he *did* recognise the *harmonic* relation between those svaras? Sômanâth too, harped, in his *Râgavibôdha,* on the same point; and it was Mr. K.B. Dêval of Sangli that showed it to the musicworld, in the face of his two opponents, Messrs. V. N. Bhâtkhandê and P. R. Bhandarkar.  
  Having taken so much pains to show that our ancient textbook writers, such as Râmâmâtya and Sômanâth, knew, each in his own way, the (modern) *Harmonics;* we should like to know what part the Harmonics or, for that matter, the Svayambhus played-and even now play - in music. In other words, what is the value of the discovery of the Harmonics or the Svayambhus in the actual or practical singing?  
  Prof. Blaserna answers, in his *Theory of Sound in relation to Music: '*A note, not accompanied by its harmonics, may sometimes be sweet; but it is always thin and poor and, therefore, but little musical. This is the case with tuning forks (and even with the flutes). The richest in harmonics are the sounds of the human voice and of strings'. And Sômanâth adds, in his *Râgavibôdha:*'The larger the number of the harmonics in a musical note, the more sonorous (and agreeable) [it is '.](http://्र "Cf. श्रावणयोग्यता अनुरणनात्मकस्य स्वराख्यस्य दीर्घत्वे न वर्तते।                                            Commentary to I. 14 of Râgavibodha.")  
  Having studied the subject of the *Vina* in almost all the aspects pointed out in *Svaramêlakalânidhi,* we shall now revert tothe original question as to how far that study helped us to understand Râmâmâtya's *Râga-system.*

  The following Diagram,¹ which represents Râmâmâtya's *Vina-system,* shows that, from among the fourteen svaras which Râmâmâtya had originally taken up to build his *Svara-system,* Anthara *Ga* and Kâkali *Ni* were eliminated, for the reason that

[TABLE]

(FIG. 16)

Chyuthamadhyama *Ga* and Chyuthashadja *Ni* were deemed to practically represent them² and that, therefore, the whole of his *Râga-system* was built up, only with the twelve remaining svaras, mentioned in Fig. 16.  
  If, now, you look at Râmâmâtya's twelve svaras and the modern³twelve svaras, at a glance, thus-

and if you refresh your memory of the special instructions given in connection with Fig. 13; you will not find it difficult to interpret almost all the Râgas of Râmâmâtya in terms of the modern Râgas. Suffice it, therefore, for me to repeat once again and emphasise the importance of what I said a little while ago,viz., *we should not allow ourselves to be \[mis-\] led by the mere 'names' of Râmâmâtya's Râgas but should delve deep and study thecharacteristics' of each of them and find out its modern prototype and its modern name, as well.*  
*  *It now remains for us to estimate the nature of the services rendered by Râmâmâtya to the music world.  
  Râmâmâtya, Sômanâth, and Venkatamakhi, the respective authors of *Svaramêlakalânidhi,* *Râgavibôdha,* and *Chathurdandiprakâsika,* were all South Indian musicians and wrote for South India. They might, therefore, be grouped together and called by a generic name-*the Carnatic Trio.* All these three authors were, alike, shrewd enough to realise the futility of writing a v-o-l-u-m-i-n-o-u-s treatise, as Shârngadev had done, on the ever-progressive, and therefore ever-changing, art of music; and they prudently chose to be agreeably brief in their works and confined their attention to the most fundamental portion of the Carnatic Music, viz., the *Râga-system.* Hence the 'Râgaprakarana' of each of their works formed, as it were, a pivot round which all other *prakaranas* or chapters revolved. Râmâmâtya, no doubt, led the way, by comprising his book into five short chapters dealing with (1) Preface, (2) Svara, (3) Vîna, (4) Mêla, and (5) Râga, by not allowing the number of his verses to rise over 328, and by making each successive chapter lead ultimately to the last. Sômanâth went one step further and made the very name of his book indicate the object of his writing[^14].  
  Again, Râmâmâtya was the first to break loose from Shârngdêv's theory of twelve *Vikritha-*svaras and reduce those twelve into seven, which Sômanâth chose to retain, but which, in the hands of Venkatamakhi, came further down to (the modern) five. In so breaking loose, he justified his position by invoking the help of a principle, learnt from Shârngadêv himself, viz., the principle of*Lakshya.*

[^14]: "Cf. ननु रागविबोधायारब्धे ग्रन्थे भवतु नामैव वस्तुसंग्रहः ।—                                Râgavibodha."

  Calculating at least from Shârngadêv's time, this 'Principle of *Lakshya'* is, to-day, about seven centuries old. But long, long ago, Kâlidâs had given us, in his *Mâlavikâgnimitra,* a popular version of the same *principle* in the following inspiring verse :-

**पुराणमित्येव न साधु सर्वं  
न चाऽपि काव्यं नवमित्यवद्यम्।  
सन्तः परीक्ष्यान्यतरद्भजन्ते  
मूढः परप्रत्ययनेयबुद्धिः॥¹**

  This verse, like the Principle of *Lakshya,* sounds to us a noteof warning that we cannot afford to live on our heritage, however great it may be, except at the peril of stagnation but must ever progress and conquer fresh fields and pastures new.  
Thanks be, therefore, to Râmâmâtya for his having set, to the music-world, a wholesome example by mercilessly attacking the old theories, however time-honored they might be, if only they contravened the eternal Principle of *Lakshya.* For, did he not make, in his second chapter on Svara, the following statements:²  
  'Achyutha Shadja does not differ from Sudha Shadja; nor does Achyutha Madhyama differ from Sudha Madhyama. Vikritha Rishabha does not differ from Sudha Rishabha; nor does Vikritha Dhaivatha differ from Sudha Dhaivatha. Vikritha Panchama, which is taken from Madhyamasruti, does not surely differ from the three-srutied Vikritha Panchama. Hence, under the category of the above-mentioned fourteen *(Sudha-Vikritha)* svaras, no separate mention was made by me of these five svaras, inasmuch as they had effected a merger'?  
  Did he not, thus, eliminate from his system, on the plea of *merger*, the five (unnecessary) svaras, viz., Achyutha *Sa,* Achyutha*Ma,* Vikritha *Ri,* Vikritha *Dha,* and Vikritha *Pa?* Did not, again, Sômanâth and Venkatamakhi regard such elimination as a good precedent and piously follow the example set by Râmâmâtya ?  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
1' All is not good, because it is old; nor is a poem bad, because it is new. The wise men examine the things, old or new, and accept what they approve of; while, the fools allow themselves to be \[mis-\] led by others.'  
2 The reader will do well to refer to Fig. 4, while perusing the state ments,

  Why, then, should any one demur—if, to-day, we proceed, on the strength of the same time-honored Principle of *Lakshya,* to break loose from Venkatamakhi's *Mêlakartha-system* and advocate, on the plea of merger, the elimination therefrom of his four (unnecessary) svaras, viz., Shatsruti *Ri,* Sudha *Ga*, Shatsruti *Dha,* and Sudha *Ni?* Hence it was that I suggested the formation of a new working scheme, called *Laghumêlakartha,* as distinguished from the *Brihanmêlakartha* of Venkatamakhi. On this controversial point, however, I shall reserve a full discussion to the Introduction to my edition of *Chathurdandiprakâsika.*Suffice it, now, for me to state, once again, that we feel highly indebted to Râmâmâtya for his having developed the *Principle of Lakshya* into a star-like maxim for all future musicians to follow.  
  Now, the credit of having first presented to us a *four-*stringed Vîna, instead of the old, antiquated *twenty-two-*stringed one, surely belongs to Râmâmâtya ;¹ and the tuning, especially, of his Madhyamêla Vîna, *almost* corresponds with that of the modern Vîna. I say almost, because the order of the three lower-wires of the Madhyamêla Vîna seems, as per the following diagram, to have undergone, from time to time, a little change; though the order of the four upper-wires thereof remains intact even to-day —as for example :—

[TABLE]

(FIG. 18)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1 Mr. K. B. Dêval fondly attributed this credit to Sômanâth, forgetting that Râmâmâtya preceded Sômanâth by more than half a century.  
  2 Never mind Venkatamakhi's unfounded charge against Râmâmâtya that the latter called the fourth upper-wire, Mandra Sa, instead of Madhya *Sa.* This, again, furnishes us with an additional reason that the mistake, if any, should be attributed to the different indifferent copyists of the manuscripts of *Svaramêlakalanidhi,* rather than to its author. Râmâmâtya who must, in all

  Again, of the eighteen svaras which appear in the seventh column of Fig. 11, it will be seen that Panchasruti *Ri* and Sudha *Ga* overlap each other; and so do Shatsruti *Ri* and Sâdhârana Ga, Panchasruti *Dha* and Sudha Ni, and Shatsruti *Dha* and Kaisiki *Ni*.¹ Eliminating, then, the four overlapping svaras, we have only fourteen svaras left. If again, as per Râmâmâtya's suggestion, the last five of his twenty mêlas are omitted, even Anthara *Ga* and Kâkali *Ni* may have to be eliminated. In that case, the fourteen svaras will have to be further reduced into twelve. Hence, there seems to be a grain of truth in Mr. D. K. Joshi's remarks that almost all ancient authors invariably used only twelve svaras in their *Râgaprakarana*, irrespective of the number of svaras described by them in their *Svaraprakarana.*² Indeed, in his Svaraprakarana, Râmâmâtya professed he would make use \[at least-\] of fourteen svaras³ in his Râga system; and hence, his final use of only twelve svaras, despite his profession to the contrary, shows that he anticipated, even in his own time, the modern tendency of reducing all the musical sounds into twelve notes. *If Râmâmâtya was the first to recognize the convenience of using only twelve svaras to build the Râga system; Ahobala was the first to describe those twelve svaras in terms of the length of the speaking wire.*  
  As for the Mêlas, Râmâmâtya rightly discarded the antic and antiquated method of deriving Râgas from the complicated system of *Grâma-Moorchana-Jati*, as well as the later puerile method of bringing them under the fanciful system of *Râga–Râgini–Putra.* On the other hand, he had the genius to discover unity in variety, that is, a unifying principle in the variety of Râgas that came under his notice; and he therefore felt that the old *cataloguing* method of enumerating the Râgas must give way to the new *classifying* method of reducing them into what might be called the

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
fairness, be deemed to have written Madhya Sa for the fourth upper-wire and not Mandra Sa. Indeed, Venkatamakhi's criticism on this point smacks of the old trick of a gladiator who would even offensively pick a quarrel only with the (innocent) object of giving his muscles the wanted exercise.

*Genus-Species system*.¹ Indeed he was the first to open, in his book, a separate chapter on *Mêla,* called 'Mêlaprakarana.' Sômanath and Venkatamakhi but followed him in this respect, though the latter formulated the Mêlas into, and thereby raised them to the dignity of, a regular code. So far, however, as Râmâmâtya was concerned, he merely hinted the *principle* he had discovered; did not care to work it out; but recorded, in his book, only such of the Mêlas as were in vogue during his time. We are thankful for the *hint* that he threw; for, it enabled Venkatamakhi to work it out to its logical consequence.  
  As for the *Râgas,* Râmâmâtya avoided getting into the labyrinth of their ancient classifications or of their ancient characteristics, but straightaway went to mention the prevailing characteristics of his Râgas as well as the time in which they were usually sung. Though, perhaps to err on the safe side, he recited the traditional story of *Mukhâri*being the Sudha-Scale; his whole mind leaned on *Mâlavagowla* which he described as the best of all Râgas[^15]'. Could this 'leaning' of Râmâmâtya have caused Purandra Dâs to heighten the importance of \[Mâya-\] *Mâlavagowla* and enable it, later on, to brush aside Venkatamakhi's *Kanakângi.*  
  Commit mistakes Râmâmâtya did. His slipping, for instance, into the out-of-the-way *Mukhâri,* as his Suddha scale, is said to have created a lot of confusion and involved Pundarika Vittala, Sômanath, and even Venkatamakhi into the same mistake, Ahôbala alone escaping. Again, in a vain attempt to follow Shârngadêv, he labelled the two-srutied Sudha *Ri*—'Trisruti *Ri'* and was therefore forced to call Sudha *Ga*—Panchasruti *Ri*' instead of 'Chathusruti *Ri*'—and thereby misled Govinda Dikshitar and his son Venkatamakhi into the same pitfall.  
  Venkatamakhi's ten charges against Râmâmâtya regarding ten Râgas have been already shown to be unjust, uncalled-for, and even offensive to a degree. Even his eleventh charge, which he

  1 Doubtless, the germ of the idea of the Genus-Species system may be found to have existed long before Râmâmâtya. But it was covered by some such rubbish as the Râga Râgini-Putra system. Hence I state what was allowed to be latent for a long time was made patent by Râmâmâtya and was, later on, codified by Venkatamakhi.

made in the first chapter of his *Chathurdandiprakâsika,—*namely, 'Râmâmâtya egregiously got down to Anumandra Sa and restricted his svaras only to two registers of voice, viz., Anumandra and Mandra; while the proper or usual way was to distribute them among three registers, viz., Mandra, Madhya, and Thâra '—even this eleventh charge may be shown to be, again, futile; if we regard the names of Anumandra, Mandra, Madhya, and Thâra as only *relative* terms, whereby we can call the same notes by different names from different standpoints of view.  
  On the whole, be the demerits of Râmâmâtya what they might as compared with the good he had done and the lead he had given, such as for instance, (1) the holding up, for future guidance, of the *Principle of Lakshya,* (2) the displacing of the old *cataloguing* method of merely enumerating the Râgas, by his own novel classifying method of reducing the same into a Genus- Species System' which, as said above, developed in the hands of Venkatamakhi, into the modern Mêlakarta Scheme', (3) the opening of a special chapter on Mêlas, called *Mêlaprakarana,* even in respect of which Sômanâth and Venkatamakhi followed suit and (4) the final heightening of the importance of *Râgaprakarana* as the quintessence of the Carnatic Music-all his demerits pale into insignificance and are, in the language of Kâlidâs-

**एको हि दोषो गुणसन्निपाते।  
निमज्जतीन्दोः किरणेष्विवाङ्कः॥**

'drowned in the ocean of good qualities, even as the spot of the moon is lost in the midst of its splendrous light.'  
  Before I finish this *Introduction*, I should like to draw my reader's attention to the seventeenth verse of the fifth chapter of Râmâmâtya's *Svaramêlakalânidhi*. For, it throws a flood of light on a hitherto-vexed question and shows the way-out to many a wandering inquirer, tired of groping from blunder to blunder. Infact, Rāmāmātya did, by this *one* verse, what his predecessor, Shārngadēv, could not do by his six verses (two in the first chapter and four in the fourth chapter of *Sangitharatnâkara*) and what even the latter's Commentator, Kallināth, could not do in his *Kalânidhi,* except in a vague manner.  
  Does it not, therefore, surpass our wonder to know that almost all the later Sanskrit writers on music chose toegregiously follow, in this respect, the Mirage of Shārngadēv rather than the Polar-Star of Râmâmâtya? Why, is it not curious for us that the very Râmâmâtya followed, in the beginning, the same Mirage, although, at the end, he succeeded to give up following the illusion and constitute himself to be a Polar-Star?  
  The reader will, at this stage, be anxious to know what I am driving at, unless it be that he referred to the said seventeenth verse and appreciated the suggestion, thrown therein.  
  On account of the present revival of musical taste, in India, on rational lines, a demand has recently and rightly arisen that the various *Terms* occurring in the Science of Music should, at first, be lucidly explained. But I fear that this is not the place for me to undertake such an onerous task. Nevertheless, I shall—as a Test Case—try to inquire here into the connotation of a pair of oft-quoted, but very-much-misunderstood, musical terms, viz., *Mârga* and *Desi*, especially because Râmâmâtya brought them into prominence in his seventeenth verse of the fifth chapter of his book. How far I succeed in my attempt I leave for my  
reader to judge.  
  I shall begin from the very beginning of music and succinctly trace it to Râmâmâtya's time, with an occasional peep even into a later time, and show that the said seventeenth verse clarified, for the first time, the otherwise feculent matter under consideration.  
  We shall, at first, understand the nature of the feculence, referred to, and shall, for this purpose, study the definitions of *Mârga* and *Dêsi*, as given by Shãrngadēv and realise how disappointed an eager inquirer will naturally feel at the muddle created thereby.  
Here are the definitions:-  
*Chapter I*  
  1. Music is of two kinds-*Mârga* and *Dêsi*. That kind was called Mârga which was sought after by Brahma and other gods and practised by Bharata and other sages in the presence of Siva and which would yield everlasting prosperity.'  
  2. 'That kind was called *Dêsi* which consisted of the vocal-instrumental-dance music and which pleased the people of different countries according to their different tastes.'  
*Chapter IV*  
  3.'That was called *Gita* or vocal music which consisted of pleasing svaras; and it fell into two divisions-Gãndharva andGāna (which were the other names of *Mârga* and *Dêsi* respectively).'  
  4. 'The wise men understood Gāndharva' to be that music which was, from time immemorial, practised by the Gandharvas and which was the means of acquiring everlasting reputation.'  
  5. "That was called *Gâna*-music which was sung in *Desi* Rāgas and which was scientifically improvised by Vaggêyakaras.'  
  6. *'Gāndharva* has been described; now *Gâna* would be described. This, again, was recognised by wise men to fall into two divisions, Nibadha and Anibadha.  
  Be it noted that this long, and even tiresome, description of *Mârga* and *Dési,* after all, fails to satisfy a crucial point. *What were the essential characteristics of Mârga and Dêsi? In what way could they be unfailingly recognised as such ?*  
  Shārngadēv and most of his successors, it must be admitted, failed to answer these questions adequately but merely observed: Brahma sought after *Mârga;* Bharata practised it; even Gandharvas practised it from time immemorial; it forms the means of acquiring everlasting reputation. As for *Dêsi* or *Gâna* it was improvised by Vaggeyakãras and was differently pleasingto the people living in different countries.'  
  Are these answers worth the name ? Have they furnished us with a key whereby we could discern the essential *characteristics* of *Mârga* and *Dêsi,* by which alone they could be unfailingly recognised ? An emphatic *No* is my reply.  
  So, as I said, I shall trace our music from the very beginning and show how and when *Mârga* and *Dêsi* came into existence, what confused mess was made of them, and how Râmâmâtya defecated the whole situation by one stroke of his single (the said seventeenth) verse and gave us a wholesome lead in the matter of getting a correct conception of those hitherto-misleading terms.  
 Into two *natural* divisions, music first falls, viz, *Anâhatha* and *Âhatha*. 'Anâhatha' literally means that which is *not beaten,* as in a drum; while, 'Âhatha' means that which is *beaten*. The real point of difference between them is that, while the former represents the sound produced without the intervention of man, the latter is the very result of man's work. Hence Anahatha' may be translated as *nature-made* music and Âhatha,' as *man-made* music*.*

  This classification, then, is rightly the first division that could possibly be made of music. So, indeed, did the text-book writers, such as Nârada and Shârngadêv, do in their respective works.¹  
  In his *Sangithamakaranda*, Nârada defined 'Anâhatha'as the sound that emanates (directly, that is, without the intervention of man) from the sky² such as the birds' warbling, and proceeded even to describe its use to man, thus: Sages, highminded souls, and even Dêvas, having controlled their mind and concentrated their attention on the *Anâhatha* Music, get the rest they require and attain salvation".³ In other words, nature is loved as the city of God, although (rather, because) there is no citizen. No unwanted noise is here or none that hinders thought. The larks warble and the cuckoos join the chorus; while the mighty waterfall furnishes a continuous drone. Again—

"Stillness, accompanied with sounds so sweet,  
Charms more than silence. Meditation here  
May think down hours to moments. Here the heart  
May give a useful lesson to the head,  
And learning wiser grow without the books "

  Shârngadêv, too, harped on the same point and came to the same conclusion that the sages worship *Anâhatha* in the manner in which they were taught by the gurus[^22].'Even the music-proof-brained Dr. Johnson seems to appreciate *Anâhatha,* when he observed, in his *Rasselas,* From the cataract, nothing more was heard than a gentle uniform murmur, such as composes the mind to pensive meditation'.

[^22]: "अनाहतं गुरूपदिष्टमार्गेण मुनयः समुपासते।                    Sangitharatnâkara."

  However much the sages and the high-minded souls might have been charmed and helped on to meditation by the *Anâhatha* or nature-made music, a question arises as to whether that music was ever relished by mankind as a whole, whether it was ever entitled to be called 'music' from the modern point of view, and whether, in short, it was pleasing to our ears.  
  The answer is by no means simple. For, to an ordinary man, the waves of the sea may produce nothing but unpleasant noise; but a poet will find in them an agreeable harmony. Infact, all those that love to hold communion with nature, as indeed the ancient sages did, will ever find the *Anâhatha*-music pleasant; while the major portion of the work-a-day world will ever find it unpleasant[^16] रक्तिविहीनत्वान्नमनोरञ्जको नृणाम् -                                  Sangitharatnâkara.").Hence Shârngadev branded it as unpleasant;' and Kâsinath followed suit[^17] नरञ्जकः-                       Sangithasudhakara.").  
  Further, the bent of man's mind has been, in all ages, to imitate the voice of nature; and hence he did not—could not—allow nature to have all the monopoly of music to itself, contributed his own share to its development and thus brought into existence another kind of music, called *Âhatha* or man-made music, the development of which I shall now trace.  
  The primitive man must have hummed like a bee and sung, at the outset, only on a single note. Witness, for instance, the courtiers' *Panegyric* which remains in vogue, even to-day, in almost all the Native States of India and which those courtiers invariably sing, as they had all along been singing, on all ceremonious occasions, such as for instance, their Sovereign's entry into the Durbar Hall. The whole 'Panegyric' will, on analysis, be found to be sung on one single note and rarely on more.  
  It was in due course of time that the other notes were tacked on, as amply evidenced by our ancient text-books which trace the music of India from *Ârchika* of single note to *Gâthika* of double note, *Sâmika* of triple note, *Svarânthara* of quadruple note,*Oudava* of quintuple note, *Shâdava* of sextuple note, and finally*Sampurna* of all the seven notes.¹  
  All these seven stages, music did pass through. But, in the first four stages, it pleased only the producers; while, in the last three, it pleased the hearers as well. 'Animal Music', if I may so call it, marked the earlier stages; and such *animal music* could please only the animals that produced it. The braying of an ass is very harsh to man but very sweet to the ass itself; for, is not such braying an expression of its elation, frolic, and joy? That was why Shakespeare wrote :—

[^16]: "सोऽपि (i.e. अनाहतोऽपि

[^17]: "सः (i.e. अनाहतः

'The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark  
*When neither is attended.'*

  Man, when he wallowed—so far at least as music was concerned—in the animal condition of life, revelled only in the earlier stages of music and could not get beyond singing on four notes. The ancient Hindus, like the ancient Greeks, had their music confined only up to four notes. The *Vedic Chant*, for instance, was all along sung on three notes; and special names were given to those three svaras, viz., *Udâtha, Anudâtha,* and *Svaritha*.³ Except, perhaps, the Sâmagânam which, at a later stage, came to be sung in all the seven notes, all other kinds of the Vêdic Chant remain, even to-day, mostly within three notes,

     उच्चैरुदात्तोनीचैरनुदात्तः समाहारः स्वरितः॥**

   In his *Siksha,* Pânini dilates on the point thus :-  
**  उदात्तोनिषादगांधारौ।अनुदात्तरिषभधैवतौ। स्वरितप्रभवाह्येते षड्जमध्यमपञ्चमाः॥**  
  That is to say, Udâtha includes *Ni* and *Ga;* Anudâtha includes *Ri* an *Dha;* and Svaritha includes, *Sa, Ma, Pa.* This view fits in with the theory of *Vâdi-Samvâdi* and explains how the primal *Sâmika,* viz., *Ga-Ri-Sa* became expanded into all the seven notes.

with a labouring struggle to touch occasionally a fourth. The whole of the Vêdic Chant would, by this time, have been—from the modern musical point of view—consigned to oblivion, had not a sacredness, bordering upon holiness, been attached to the Vêdas, as containing Divine Wisdom.  
  It goes without saying that our ancients entertained, as we ourselves do even to-day, an unshaken faith that the Vêdas emanated out of Parabrahma; that they were eagerly sought after by gods like Brahma, and chanted by sages like Bharata; that they formed, as it were, à talisman to do away with the necessity of being born, and that they were deemed, on that account, to be worthy of the highest respect.  
  All these attributes of the Vêdas got themselves, later on, imperceptibly transferred to the very music by which they were chanted. Hence, the Vêdic Chant, to which the text–book writers gave the name of *Mârga*,¹has been described in all the Sanskrit books on music, such as, for instance, *Sangitharatnâkara :* —'That kind (of music) is called *Mârga*, which was sought after by Brahma and other gods and practised by Bharata and other sages in the presence of Siva and which would yield everlasting prosperity.'² In his *Prabandhâdhyâya,* Shârngadêv called Mârga by a different name, viz., *Gândharva,*³ which latter name Râmâmâtya adopted and made use of in his *Svaramêlakalânidhi.*

-------------------------------------------------------------------  
  1 The word 'Mârga' is derived from **मृग***(Mrig)* 'to seek or search after.' That the search was in regard to the Vêdas is clear from Kallinâth's commentary :– **मार्गित्वं चतुर्षुवेदेष्वन्विष्यकृतत्वात्।** Hence the word Mârga refers to the Vêdic Chant and, I may add, refers-by way of courtesy-even to the chanting of the *Râmâyana* which, along with the *Mahâbhârata,* was regarded as holy as the Vêdas themselves and which Kusa and Lava, therefore, sang in the *Mârga*-style. For, Vâlmîki said :—  
          **ततस्तु तौ रामवचःप्रचोदितावगायतां मार्गविधानसंपदा।**  
  2 (a) See page lxiii.  
    (b) Cf. **......... मार्गसउच्यते ।  
       योमार्गितो विरिञ्च्याद्यैः प्रयुक्तो भरतादिभिः।  
       देवस्यपुरतःशंभोर्नियताभ्युदयप्रदः॥     
*Sangitharatnâkara.***  
  3 Cf. **गांधर्व गानमित्यस्य भेदद्वयमुदीरितम् - *Ibid.***  
In his commentary, Kallinâth interprets 'Gândharva' only as *Mârga*-  
   Cf. **गांधर्वमार्गः। गानं तु देशीत्यवगन्तव्यम्।**

  Gândharva or Mârga—the descriptive name given to it by Shârngadêv and copied by Râmâmâtya, viz., *Anâdisampradâya*,¹clearly shows that the Vêdic Chant or, for that matter, the *Mârga*-music had been practised from time immemorial and should therefore be regarded as holy and spiritual as the Vêdas themselves.  
   Hence, I venture to call Mârga', *Vêdic Music.*  
  Now, Mârga or Gândharva or Vêdic Music-call it what you may, the one important point which I desire to rivet upon the reader's attention is that the so-called Mârga-music, apart from its having been sought after by Brahma and practised by Bharata and apart from its having been used in connection with such a holy purpose as the chanting of the divine Vêdas, I submit that the Mârga-music was almost never sung beyond four notes; and that this limitation of the range of the scale from one to four notes must be deemed to be the peculiar and essential characteristic of Marga-Sangitham.²  
  These imperfect scales of the *Mârga*-music belonged, as said above, to the earlier stage of music which pleased only the producers and not the hearers. Further, as Râmâmâtya suggests,³ the rules of *Siksha* (Phonetics) and other time-honored Lakshanas were scrupulously observed in chanting the Vêdas; and these very rules and lakshanas clogged, on account of their *inflexible* nature, the further growth of music from its Mârga-stage. The Principle of *Lakshya,* by which alone the artistic charm of music could be preserved, was never applied to the *Mârga*-music but only to the *Desi*-music, of which we shall speak presently.⁴ It is no

  1Cf. Kallinath's commentary on *Anâdisampradâya.*  
   **अनादिसंप्रदायमित्यनेन गांधर्वस्य वेदवदपौरुषेयत्वमिति सूचितं भवति।**  
 2 That the Vêdas were chanted almost on the systems of Ârchika, Gâthika, and Sâmika, is evidenced by such assertions in the *Rig-Vêda* as 'Archinô Gâyanthi'; 'Gâthinô Gâyanthi'; 'Sâminô Gâyanthi'.*Rig-Veda* makes no reference to Oudava, Shâdava, and Sampurna.

  Here, Kallināth interprets **एतानि शास्त्राणि** to be **देशीविषयाणीत्यर्थः।**

wonder, therefore, that the *Mârga*-music, the rules of which were inflexibly stiff and did not adjust themselves to the practice in vogue, became, in the course of time, less and less pleasant, less and less popular, and finally extinct.¹  
The latter three stages of music, viz., *Oudava, Shâdava, Sampurna*, have been, however, preserved even to-day as being *human*² music which pleases, alike, the producers as well as the hearers. To the music of these 'latter three stages', our ancients gave the name of *Dêsi.* In the first place, the style of '*Dêsi*' varied from province to province; and it was therefore defined inSanskrit text-books, such as for instance, *Sangithadarpana* —**That kind of music is called *Dêsi,* which adjusts itself from country to country (Dêsa to Dêsa), so as to please the fancy of the people there'.³ In the second place, the fact that Shârngadêv and Râmâmâtya employed *Hridayaranjaka*⁴ and *Janaranjana*[^18]as their respective epithets to *Dêsi*-music-shows that they regarded it as a fascinating style of music, as opposed to the dry, monotonous, and sing-song style of the *Mârga*-music. If any proof is wanted for the fact that the first four stages of music, covered by the generic name of *Mârga*, belonged-purely from the modern musical point of view-to the lower rung of the ladder and that the second three stages, covered by the generic name of*Dêsi*, belonged to the higher rung; a reference may be made to what Hridayanarayana wrote-'*Sampurnas* are Brahmins ;

                       -*Sangitharatnakara***

*Shâdavas* are Kshatriyas; *Oudavas* are Vaisyas; and the scales of lesser notes are Sudras'.¹  
  Summing up, we arrive at the following tentative conclusion with regard to the essential characteristics of *Mârga* and *Desi,* viz., 'while the scale of the Mârga-music ranged from one to four notes; that of the Dêsi-music ranged from five to seven notes.'  
  I called this conclusion *tentative,* because, on closer scrutiny, it seems to need a little reconsideration. Two facts (I was going to say two premises), viz. (1) Sâmagânam has been, all along, Mârga-music, and (2) Sâmagânam came, at a later stage, to be sung in all the seven notes (which were, then, called *Krushta, Prathama, Dvithiya, Thrithiya, Chathurtha, Mandra,* and *Athisvara*) - these two facts or premises compel us to modify the above tentative conclusion to a final form thus: 'The scale of the Mârga-music ordinarily ranged from one to four notes but, during the later *Sâman*-period, rose to seven notes; ² while that of the Dêsi-music completely eschewed the scale of one to four notes but confined itself only to the scale of five to seven notes.'  
 The seventeenth verse of the fifth chapter of Râmâmâtya's *Svaramêlakâlânidhi,* to which, I said at the outset, I desired to draw my reader's attention, amply bears out my conclusion and is, in fact, an authority for my position. It runs thus:-

**देशीरागाश्चसकलाः षड्जग्रामसमुद्भवाः।  
ग्रहांशन्यासमन्द्रादि षाडवौडुव पूर्णकाः॥**

which means 'All the *Dêsi*-Râgas are those of Shadjagrâma and have each its Graha, Amsa, Nyâsa, Mandra, and so forth. Further, they fall into three divisions-*Oudava, Shâdava,* and *Sampurna*.' Sômanâth followed Râmâmâtya in this respect.  
  Another Sanskrit text-writer who, like Râmâmâtya, ventured to cut this Gordian Knot was the author of a very recent publication, *Sangithasudhâkara.* Kâsinâth (for that was the author's name) wrote in his book :-

**अधुना देशीगीतं तु दृश्यते क्वचन क्वचित्।  
प्रथितानि पुनस्त्रीणि रागाणां लक्षणानि हि॥**

-----------------------------------------------------------------  
  ¹ Cf. **संपूर्णा ब्राह्मणाःप्रोक्ताः क्षत्रियाः षाडवा मताः।  
      औडुवाःकथिता वैश्याः शूद्रास्तदितरे क्वचित्॥
-*Hridayakouthuka***  
 ² But, be it remembered, the *Sâman* seven notes were, unlike the modern seven notes, in *descending* order of pitch.

**संपूर्णत्वं षाडवत्वमौडुवत्वं च सर्वदा।  
संंपूर्णः सप्तभिःप्रोक्तः स्वरैःषड्भिस्तु षाडवः॥  
औडवः पञ्चभिर्ज्ञेयो राग एतदिह स्फुटम्॥**

which means '*Dêsi*-music is prevalent to-day, the three characteristical Râgas of which are *Sampurna* of seven notes, *Shâdava*of six notes, and *Oudava*, of five notes.'  
  Let us, in conclusion, compare and contrast the two kinds of music, we have been considering, viz, *Mârga and Dêsi :-*  
    (1) The Mârga-music was confined to the chanting of the Vêdas; while, the Dêsi-music had no such limits.  
    (2) The Mârga-music identified itself with the Vêdas, got all their attributes transferred to itself, and was therefore regarded as having been sought after by the gods and practised by the sages; while the Dêsi-music had no such reputation.  
    (3) The Marga-music was, on account of its strict and inflexible rules, sung uniformly throughout the country; while, the Dêsi-music, untrammelled by such rules, varied its style from province to province.  
    (4) The Mârga-music followed the principle of *Lakshana*and therefore became less and less pleasant, till at last it degenerated into a dry, monotonous, and sing-song style of singing; while, the Dêsi-music followed the principle of *Lakshya*and has therefore acquired a more and more fascinating style of singing.  
    (5) The Mârga-music is now *practically* I extinct; while the Dêsi-music flourishes to-day.  
   (6) The Mârga-music used all the three Grâmas—Shadja, Madhyama, and Gândhara; while the Dêsi-music is confined only to one Grâma, viz. Shadja.  
    (7) The scale of the Mârga-music ordinarily ranged from one to four notes but, during the later *Sâman*-period, rose to seven notes; while the scale of the Dêsi-music completely eschewed the scale of one to four notes but confined itself only to the scale of five to seven notes.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  1 I say 'practically', because the Mârga-music is found, even to-day,in the hands of Vaidika-Brahmins who employ it whenever, on ceremoniousoccasions, they chant the Vêdas.

  (8) The three-fold classification of Music into *Gita, V*adya,and Nrithya applies-not to Mârga-but only to Dêsi.  
  (9) Later on, the word 'Mârga' has come to mean whatever is old and out-of-date; while the word 'Dêsi' has come  
to mean whatever is new and *up-to-date.*  
 Just as I called Mârga, *Vedic Music*; so, I shall call Dêsi,*Modern Music*.  
  The following Table, I trust, fixes *Mârga and Dêsi* in their proper places:-

**CHAPTER I**  
**PREFACE**  
*Benediction*

  1. May Nârâyana protect us all-Nârâyana, whose unrivalled wealth consisted in Srî-râga, that is, in his love for Lakshmi;whose form is sublime and beautiful; who is surrounded by devoted experts in the matter of Svara, Sruti, Grâma, Style, and soforth; who is a lover of the Theatre; who delights in the eternalrhythm; who is himself Nâdabrahmam; and whose body is fullof decorations.

*Râma Râja's Pedigree*

  2. Formerly, the ancient Brahma, appeared from amidst theLotus that emanated from the navel of Vishnu, just as the essenceof music did from Sâma Vêda or the philosophy from VêdântaSâstra.  
  3-4. To this Brahma, was born Athri from whose eyes was,again, born the Moon, who was a friend of the Dêvas and byvirtue of whose rays the waters of all the rivers are of help to theocean (by flowing into it); and who forms one of the eyes ofVishnu in whose belly the earth exists, and also who showed it tothe world that he (moon) invariably enables the irreproachableocean, which is full of shining corals, to more and more swell andflow, by dint of the law of causation.  
  5. To this Moon, then, was born a son named Budha; toBudha was born Pururava; and to Pururava was born the virtuousÂyu. It was, again, to the dynasty of this Âyu that Yayâthi'sfather, Nahusha, as well as Bharata and others, belonged.  
  6. As an ornament to the family of those mentioned above,was born Sri Ranga Râja, who surpassed Kubera in point of wealth, who enjoyed the contented earth (that is, whose subjects led a contented life); and who, by dint of his good conduct,attained the status of Râjarshi.  
  7. Thimmâmbikâ was Sri Ranga Râja's wife; and shewas the embodiment of all the good qualities of the virtuouswomen **–**chaste, illustrious, modest, unjealous, clever, truthful,and happy.  
  8. To Sri Ranga Râja and his Queen Thimmâmbikâ was born, as a result of their penance, Râma Râja, the king of all kings.

*Râma Râja's Father-in-law and his two Brothers*

  Krishna Râya gave his daughter in marriage to this Râma Râja and thereby enhanced the dignity of the parenthood of daughters.  
  9.Râma Râja had two royal brothers, the wellknownThimmarâja and Srî Vênkatâdri, just as Dharmaputra of unblemished conduct, had two of his noble brothers, Bhima and Arjuna of dreadful arms.

*Râma Râja's Devotion and Prowess*

  10. Inasmuch as Râma Râja's arms were powerful enough to conquer even Âdisêsha, there was nothing marvellous in his ruling the earth. But the real wonder lay in the fact that his mind, atomic though, was able to bear the foremost God of the world, Lord Seshâchala.  
  11. With only a sword in hand, Râma Râja set out from Vidyâpura, accompanied by his two brothers; met at Guthigiri the helpless king, named Sadâsiva; defeated all the traitorous and inimical princes; placed the said Sadâsiva on the auspicious Carnatic Throne, as Vishnu had done Dhruva; and thereby became all the more famous.  
 12. And, having got the same energies as actuated Dadhichi, Râdhêya (*Karna*), Sibi, Jimûthavâhana (*Indra*), and others intonoble action and having thereby acquired wide fame, he (the king) grew, in this world, more and more strong.  
  13.With his two brothers never leaving his two sides, he—who was, as it were, an *avatâr* of Râma-shone in the earth, day and night, just as Mêru shone with its (never-leaving) Sun and Moon.  
  14. Having defeated in battle all the Persians and thrown, forcibly into the air, the raiments of their rotten fame, he adorned the Girls of Directions with the silken garment of his (own solid) fame.

*Râma Râja's Palace and his Enjoyment therein*

  15. Having noted that the palace, called *Ratnakûta* and built under the guidance of the noble Râmâmâtya, beat, in point of beauty, even the palace of Indra; Râma Râja became lost in wonder and joy.  
  16. People declared this palace to be another Mêru; inasmuch as both of them had a variety of lustrous flamingos, were so strongly built as to last for ever, and were also provided with many an Indra-Sabha-like Hall and many a Play-Ground.  
  17. The splendour of the flags of the palace, which were moved by gentle breezes, looked—by coming in contact with the branches of the Mandâra trees—like a circular dance of the celestial nymphs wandering in the grove.  
  18. The unmarried girls, residing in that palace, proceeded to celebrate the marriage of their several pairs of dolls by placing their (the dolls') feet on the fringe of the stone-like disc of the full moon.  
  19. It was in this palace that Râma Râja, surrounded by experts and Sêsha-like musicians, spent his time with joy.  
 20-21-22. And he (the king) gave Ear-ornaments to Râmâmâtya, after having heard the Prabhandas composed by him and sung, in the assembly, by *Vainikas* accompanied by the accurate vocal music of his pupils**–**Prabhandas, technically known as Êla, Râgakadamba, Mâthrika, thirty-two Sudakas, the well-known Panchathâlêsvaras, Srîranga, Dvipada, Svarânka, Srîvilâsa, thethirty illuminating, elaborate, and very valuable Prabhandas, the sixteen interesting Dhruvas, the forty-six Sâlagasudas written in majestic style, Pancharatnas containing twenty Râgas, and other works, such as Gîta, Alankâra, and Âlâpana with letters sounded.

*Venkatadri's Request to Râma Raja*

  23. When, in the assembly, Râma Râja was enjoying the pleasure of (hearing, or making, or even helping to make) musical compositions ; Sri Vênkatâdri, the lion of kings, availed himself of a favourable opportunity and addressed the king with all humility thus :—  
 24. 'The Science of Music has, both in theory and practice,degenerated into conflicting views. Let Râmamantri (Râmâmâtya) reconcile, by your word of command, all (the conflicting views) and write a (new) science.'

*Râma Râjả’s Requisition to Râmâmậtya*

  25. Then, Râma Râja, King of Srîrangam, addressed Râmâmâtya, who was seated in the vicinity of the king and who had studied the secret of the art of Music, thus:—  
  26. 'In this world, some know only the theory of music, while others know only its practice; as for the person who knows both of them, I have not come across anybody else than you.  
  27. 'Inasmuch as the learned Kallapadêsika, who was as famous in music as Dathila, is your grand-father, that traditional lore of music palpitates in your pulse.  
  28. 'In the science of music, conflicting views have indeed arisen. Bring to a focus all their salient features and write an interesting treatise on music, embodying therein its theory and practice.  
  29. 'Just as, in former times, Patanjali evolved, with his knowledge of Pânini's works, the science of words; you had better standardise, and thereby facilitate, the study of Svaras, in conformity with the views of Bharata and others.'

*Râma Râjas Encouragement to Râmâmâtya*

  30. Saying let this please your heart,' Râma Râja gave Râmâmâtya the camphor-smelling betels. While, Râmamantri received them and, having thereby agreed to comply with the king's command, contemplated (about the new book).  
  31. The king (meanwhile) granted to me a chief fort in the principality of Kôndavita and also made me the Overlord of an estate washed by the eastern sea.  
  32. On the strength of this royal grant, Râmâmâtya caused many *agrahârâs* to be built and thereby gave shelter to many a Brahmin, by whose blessings he obtained boundless popularity.  
  33. As though it were only a gemmed garland, he (the king) gave me, again, the Over-lordship of the non-western *(i.. e. eastern)*ocean, along with the town of Jêloorisimmâsana and thereby made me equal in rank to the king himself.

*Râmâmâtya's Project, in gratitude, of Svaramêlakalânidhi*

  34. Inasmuch as the king graciously gave me magnificent presents from day to day, I**–**now made equal in rank to the king and able to please him**–**am a little anxious to return the good office of the king and also be of some service to the world at large.

  35. Ere long, I shall write *Svaramêlakalânidhi,* dedicate it to the king and discharge my debt of deep gratitude to him.  
  36. Having thus resolved, I-Râmamantri, an able leader in the accomplishment of Sangitha-sâhithya - undertake to speak about it, that is, relate the contents thereof.

*Contents*

  37–38. In this *Svaramêlakalânidhi,* written by Râmâmâtya,there are five chapters, namely, *Preface, Svara, Vina, Mêla,* and*Râga.*  
  39–40–41.After the chapter on *Preface,* the following are expounded by Râmamantri, in conformity with the theory and practice of music. In the second chapter on *Svara*:—The value of music, the difference between Gândharva and Gâna, Registers of voice, Srutis, Sudha-Vikritha svaras and their nomenclatures.  
  41–42–43.In the third chapter on *Vina,* a good expositionhas been made of—the value of Vina, the method of tuning it, the standardization of Sudha-Vikritha svaras, and the three kinds  
of Vina, namely, *Sudha Mêla, Madhya Mêla, and Achyutharajêndra Mêla.*  
  44–45. In the fourth chapter on *Mêlas*, twenty Mêlas and the Mêla-derived Râgas are discussed. And their nomenclatures too are severally given. As an alternative, only fifteen Mêlas are recognized; but, in the main, there are twenty Mêlas.  
  46–47. In the fifth chapter, which is the chief one in this work, the three kinds of Râgas into *Superior, Middling and Inferior*are discussed; as also their special characteristics. These are the contents of the book.  

**CHAPTER II**

**SVARA**

*The Origin and Value of Music*

  1–6. Brahma got this music from Sâma Vêda. While the all-knowing Siva, Pârvati's Lord, is pleased with the Vocal Music; the eternal Krishna, the Lord of the Gôpis, is amenable to the music of the Flute. While, again, Brahma is fond of the Sâman Chant; Saraswathi is desirous of the Vina. Why should there be-indeed, need there be-any mention at all of the musicaltastes of the Yakshas, the Gandharvas, the Dêvas, the Râkshasasand the Human Beings? Further, children who are ignorant ofthe sensual enjoyment and crying in a cradle, become ecstatic,on drinking the milk of music. And again, beasts and theiryoung ones, roaming in the forest with grass for their food, yearnfor the hunter's music; and when they hear it, mark! they give uptheir lives for it. Even the venomous serpent is rejoiced withhearing music. Who, then, can adequately describe the peculiarvirtues of the art of music?

*Music and its two kinds*

  A group of Svaras capable of ravishing the ear constitutesmusic.

  7-8-9. And it is said to be of two kinds—*Gândharva* and *Gâna*. That kind of music is called *Gândharva*, which has been,from time immemorial, practised by the Gandharvas and whichsurely leads to Môksha. Again, that kind of music is called 'Gâna', which is composed by *Vâggêyakâras* (that is, by thosewho are capable of composing as well as singing) in Dêsi Ragasand in conformity with the recognised rules and which is alsopleasing to the people. The *Gândharva* Music is ever employedin conformity with the (inflexible) rules of the theory.

*The Principle of Lakshya*

  10-11-12. But if the violation of those theoretical rules,inflexible though, do not lead to any absurdity; and if, again, thecontravention of any of the rules of practice does not give pleasure,but jars, to the ear; then, the *practice* of music shall be preferredto its *theory*. Hence, the *Gâna* Music prevails in this world inconformity with the rules of practice. Indeed, its chief thing hasbeen all along the principle of *Lakshya* and never the inflexibletheoretical rules.

  12 to 17. In his chapter on *Instruments*, Shârngasuri, whowas well-versed in all the music-lore, argued that the practice ofmusic was more important than its theory, thus:— The learnedmen are of opinion that the chief thing of the whole (Dêsi) musicis the *Lakshya* or practical side of it, that the practice of anyscience is more important than its theory and that, in case of anydifference between the two, there seems to be no other way-outthan readjusting the science with the art. Since the laws ofGraha, Amsa, Nyâsa, and so forth are within the scope of the musical science and since the arrangement of the other Svaras (such as Apanyâsa), stands on the principle of Lakshya, withouthowever doing any kind of injustice to the science; Shârngadêv Suri determined, in all the Dêsi Ragas, the method of how to remove the differences between the theory and practice of music.'In as much as the same Shârngadêv clearly stated the broad principles of the *Gâna* Music, I shall also follow suit, make the‘Principle of Lakshya' the chief thing in my book and proceed to describe its characteristics. Thus the whole music seems to fall into the two divisions spoken of.

*Sound*

  18-19. The soul, desirous of speaking out its intention,excites the mind; and the mind operates on the vital heat of the body by setting the air in motion; and the air, remaining in the Brahmagranthi (?), rises up and produces ‘Sound,' through the navel, the heart, the neck, the head, and the face.

*Registers*

  20-21. The sound, thus defined, falls into five divisions—*very subtle, subtle, developed,* *undeveloped,* and *artificial.* But, for all practical purposes, there are only three kinds of sound, called Registers—‘*Mandra'* in the chest, ‘*Madhya'* in the neck, and '*Thâra,'* in the head; each succeeding register being doubly louder than its preceding one.

*Srutis*

  22-24. This sound (of each of the three registers) stands divided into twenty-two Srutis, all within the limits of audibility. And the Nâdis, connected in the chest with the higher Nâdi, are also twenty-two. Those Srutis, impinged by the air across those Nâdis, rise up progressively in pitch. So is the case with those of the neck as well as with those of the head. The Srutis are thus twenty-two in number.

*Svaras*

  24-25. From the Srutis arose the seven Svaras - Shadja, Rishabha, Gândhâra, Madhyama, Panchama, Dhaivatha, and Nishâda. And their respective symbols are - *Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni.*

  26. That is called *Svara*, which is by itself pleasing to the ear and the mind; which permeates the Srutis; and which is tender and harmonic.  
  27. The significance of this statement is better explained in terms of the Vina.

*Allocation of the seven Svaras*

  27-30.The Svaras arise from the Srutis in such a manner that Shadja takes the fourth Sruti of the Vina; Rishabha, the seventh; Gândhâra, the ninth; Madhyama, the thirteenth; Panchama, the seventeenth; Dhaivatha, the twentieth; and Nishâda, the twenty-second. Gândhâra and Nishâda take each two Srutis; Rishabha and Dhaivatha take each three Srutis; while, Shadja, Madhyama, and Panchama take each four Srutis.

*An Objection*

  30-31. Be the above allocation, namely, of giving Shadja four Sruthis and so forth, what it may; how are the three Srutis preceding the fourth accounted for?

*An Answer to the Objection*

  31-32. We shall answer: The fourth Sruti. anticipates as a matter of fact all its preceding Srutis and means and includes them. Thus, it is settled that, as regards Srutis, every succeeding one anticipates all that precede it and means and includes them.

*Sudha-Vikritha Svaras*

  32-33- These seven Svaras[^19], beginning with Shadja, are called *Sudha* Svaras. While, the *Vikritha* Svaras are also seven. In all, there are fourteen Svaras—Sudha and Vikritha.

[^19]: "As indicated in verses 27 to 30."

*A Second Objection*

  33-34. How is it that you have given only *seven* Vikritha Svaras, while Shârngadêv mentioned, in his *Ratnâkara,* so many *as twelve?*

*An Answer to the Second Objection*

  34-38. It is true that, from the theoretical point of view, the number *twelve* may be desirable. But, in actual practice, thereare only seven Vikritha-Svaras, as being different from the seven Sudha-Svaras. If the basic notes are left out, there doesarise a difference in sound, as regards the remaining five Vikritha-Svaras. But if they (the basic notes) are retained, the said difference disappears in practice, though not in theory, by the process of taking the preceding—but not the next preceding—Srutis.I shall tell you how.

*How the 12 Vikritha Svaras became 7*

  38-42. Achyutha Shadja does not differ from Sudha Shadja; nor does Achyutha Madhyama differ from Sudha Madhyama. Vikritha Rishabha does not differ from Sudha Rishabha; nor does Vikritha Dhaivatha differ from Sudha Dhaivatha. Vikritha Panchama, which is taken from Madhya masruti, does not surely differ from the three Srutied Vikritha Panchama. Hence, under the category of the above-mentioned fourteen (SudhaVikritha) Svaras, no separate mention was made by me of these five Svaras, inasmuch as they had effected a merger.

*Seven Vikritha Svaras*

  42-44. We shall enunciate the seven Vikritha-Svaras by mentioning their names and also statetheir characteristics. The names are—

|     |                    |
|-----|--------------------|
| 1   | Chyutha Shadja     |
| 2   | Chyutha Madhyama   |
| 3   | Chyutha Panchama   |
| 4   | Sâdhârana Gândhâra |
| 5   | Anthara Gândhâra   |
| 6   | Kaisiki Nishâda    |
| 7   | and Kâkali Nishâda |

*Their Characteristics*

  44-49. 'Chyutha Shadja' is the name given to that Shadja which gives up its own fourth Sruti and takes the third one.The same rule equally applies to 'Chyutha Madhyama' and 'Chyutha Panchama'. When Sudha Madhyama takes the first Gândhâra Sruti, it is called 'Sâdhârana Gândhâra'; but when the same Sudha Madhyama takes the second Gândhâra Sruti, it goes by the name of ‘Anthara Gândhâra.' When, again, SudhaShadja takes the first Nishâda Sruti, it is called by expert musicians 'Kaisiki Nishâda'; but when it takes the second Nishâda Sruti, it goes by the name of 'Kâkali Nishâda'. Thus, the seven (Vikritha Svaras) have been described.

*Another Nomenclature*

 49-57. In fulfilment of a usage, I shall now mention a few different nomenclatures to some of these fourteen Svaras obtaining elsewhere. On account of its identity with Nishâda, Chyutha Shadja is also called *Chyutha Shadja Nishâda.* On account of its identity with Gândhâra, Chyutha Madhyama is also called by me *Chyutha Madhyama Gândhára.* On account of its identity with Madhyama, Chyutha Panchama is also called by me *ChyuthaPanchama Madhyama.* Inasmuch as Rishabha is, in practice, known to identify itself with Sudha Gândhâra; the latter (Sudha Gândhâra) is called by me *Panchasruti Rishabha.* When, however, Rishabha identifies itself with Sâdhârana Gândhâra; that Sâdhârana Gândhâra is, in practice, also called *Shatsruti Rishabha.*Likewise, when Dhaivatha identifies itself with Sudha Nishâda, that *Sudha Nishâda* is called *Panchasruti Dhaivatha*; but when it identifies itself with Kaisiki Nishâda*,* that *Kaisiki Nishâda* is called *Shatsruti Dhaivatha.*

*Recapitulation*

  57-65. For the better understanding of the chapters on Râga and Mêla, that are going to be related, the above-mentioned Svaras are herein duly recapitulated. The seven Sudha Svaras are to be known, in order, thus:—Sudha Shadja, Sudha Rishabha,Sudha Gândhâra, Sudha Madhyama, Sudha Panchama, Sudha Dhaivatha, and Sudha Nishâda. The seven Vikritha Svaras are declared to be:—Chyutha Shadja Nishâda, Chyutha Madhyama Gândhâra, Chyutha Panchama Madhyama, Sâdhârana Gândhâra, Anthara Gândhâra, Kaisiki Nishâda and Kâkali Nishâda. Sudha Gandhara is known as Panchasruti Rishabha, while Sâdhârana Gândhâra is known as Shatsruti Rishabha. In some places,another view obtains in regard to the association of Râgas according to the Gâna Music. Sudha Nishâda is known as Panchasruti Dhaivatha, while Kaisiki Nishâda is known as Shatsruti Dhaivatha. These fourteen Șvaras occur in every Râga; while, now and then, the seven Svaras have, in some places, more than three registers.

**CHAPTER III**

**VINA**

  I-2. The Svaras having been explained, an account of howthe Mêlas and Râgas are formed, is given. Since that accountcan be clearly expounded only with the help of the Vina, I shall now describe the Vina in conformity with the theory and practiceof music.

*Its Construction and Importance*

  2-4. *Danda* (or the CrossBar of the Vina) is Sambu;*Thanthri*(or the Wire) is Uma; *Kakubha* (or the Piece of Wood atits end) is Kamalâpati; *Pathrika* (or the Metallic piece for thewires to runover) is Lakshmi; *Thumba* (or the Gourd attached tothe Cross-Bar) is Brahma; and Nâbhi (or the Round piece ofmetal which connects the gourd with the cross-bar) is Saraswathi.*Dôraka* (or the strings used for fastening the wires) is Vâsuki;*Jiva* (or Bits of cotton or woollen or even silken threads used forrefining the sound) is the Moon; and *Sârikas* (or the Metallic fretsplaced over the crossbar) form the Sun. Hence, Vina is theembodiment of all the gods and is therefore very auspicious.

  4-6. It is capable of purifying the wicked persons that committed the sin of murdering the Brahmins and is also capable ofgiving, at mere touch or sight, Svarga and Apavarga (that is,temporary enjoyment and eternal bliss). Since, thus, the expertmusicians and Munis, like Bharata and others, praised the Vina,I am also of opinion that the Vina is really praiseworthy.

  6-II. This (Vina) is verily a means of procuring (the fourObjects of Life, namely), Dharma, Artha, Kâma and Môksha. Itprocures *Dharma* (or Righteousness), in as much as it is laid downin the Vêdas that, in connection with the Horse-Sacrifice, ‘twoBrahmins should play on the Vina (in concert with a third Brahmin singing)'. It procures *Artha* (or Wealth), in as much as theVainikas obtain their expected money from the kings who areenamoured of the Vina. The Vêdas declare that ‘women lovethe musicians'; and hence the Vina procures *Kâma*. Yâgnavâlkyapraised the Vina thus: ‘Whoever knows the secrets of Vinaplay, whoever is an adept in the matter of Srutis and Jâthis, andwhoever is wellversed in Thâla easily does he get into the wayof *Môksha*,'

*The Name of the Vina and its Kinds*

  II-17. That Vina is called RUDRA VINA; for Rudra(Siva) is fond of it. It is, in practice, found to be of three kinds, namely, (1) Sudha Mêla Vina, (2) Madhya Mêla Vina and (3) Achyutharâjêndra Mêla Vina. Each of these three kinds falls into two varieties, namely, (i) Sarvarâga Mêla Vina and (ii) Êkarâga Mêla Vina. That Vina is called *Sarvarâga Mêla Vina,* the frets of which are fixed and, yet, made to produce all the Râgas in all the registers. While, it is called *Êkarâga Mêla Vina,* the frets of which are moved or changed, every time a Raga is changed. A third variety in Madhya Mêla Vina is suggested thus :— 'Leave the first three wires of the Madhya Mêla Vina and take up the fourth wire of Shadja; and, on this fourth wire, make use of all the frets in all the three registers.' Since this (suggested) variety is already comprised or implied in Madhya Mêla Vina, no separate mention of it has been made.

*The Characteristics of the various kinds of Rudra Vina*

*(a) Sudha Mêla Vina*

  18-20. The characteristics of these three kinds of the Vina,namely, Sudha Mêla, Madhya Mêla,and Achyutharâjêndra Mêla,are (now) described from the standpoint of practice.of practice. First, the characteristics of Sudha Mêla Vina are dealt with. Let fourmetallic wires be fastened on the upper part of the Vina, constructed by a clever mechanic who knows his business well. Below,but near (the four wires) and on the righthand side, let three wires be fastened.

  21-23. The arrangement of the Svaras (speaking) on theseseven wires is (now) told. Of the four upper wires, the first—on the lefthand side—may be named *Anumandra Shadja;* the second, *Anumandra Panchama;* the third, *Mandra Shadja*; and the fourth, *Mandra Madhyama*.

  24-26. The arrangement of the Svaras (speaking) on the three lower wires is (then) told. The first (of the three lower wires) is of the same Sruti as *Madhya Shadja* (that is, produces Madhya Shadja); the second, *Mandra Panchama;* and the third, *Mandra Shadja.* These three side wires are called 'Srutis.'  
  26-31. Then, the arrangement of the Frets is described in conformity with the views of the Vainikas. On the first Anumandra *Sa*-wire, should be placed frets Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,so that they may produce respectively the following Svaras :-  
Sudha *Ri*, Sudha *Ga*, Sâdhârana *Ga*, Chyuthamadhyama *Ga*, Sudha *Ma*, and Chyuthapanchama *Ma*.  
  31-34. We shall consider what Svaras these six frets produce on the other three (upper) wires. On the second wire, called Anumandra Panchama, the same six frets produce respec-  
tively the following Svaras :-Sudha *Dha*, Sudha *N*i, Kaisiki *Ni*, Chyuthashadja *Ni*, Sudha *Sa*, and Sudha *Ri.*  
  35-36. The two Svaras, namely, Sudha *Sa* and Sudha *Ri*produced on the second wire, occur again on the third wire, in Mandra, and are therefore of no use on the second wire. The Anumandra Svaras have been described; now, I shall deal with the Mandra Svaras.  
  37-39. The Svaras, which the same six frets produce on the third Mandra *Sa*-wire, are, as in the case of Anumandra Sa wire, as follows:-Sudha *Ri*, Sudha *Ga*, Sâdhârana *Ga*, Chyuthamadhyama *Ga,* Sudha *Ma*, and Chyuthapanchama *Ma*.  
  39-40. Since Sudha *Ma* and Chyuthapanchama *Ma* occur,again, on the fourth wire, they are of no use on the third wire.  
  41-43. The Svaras, which the same six frets produce on the fourth Mandra *Ma*-wire, are:-Chyuthapanchama *Ma*, Sudha*Pa*, Sudha *Dha*, Sudha *Ni*, Kaisiki *Ni*, and Chyuthashadja *Ni*.  
These are considered to be *Mandra-Svaras*.  
  43-44. In this manner, all the Anumandra-and-Mandra- Svaras are duly produced by the said six frets on the said four wires.

*Svayambhus*

 44-62. The following Svaras are *Svayambhus,* that is, thoseof natural creation and not of man's making. The method ofdetermining their values is now explained. It is agreed on allhands that the two Svaras between which there is an interval oftwelve or eight Sruthis are *Samvâdis* to each other. This pointhas been well explained in *Ratnâkara*. Another method ofdetermining the values of Svayambhus is as follows:-The MandraSudha *Pa,* produced on the fourth wire by the second fret, iscalled Svayambhu. Hence all the Svaras produced (on all the fourwires) by the second fret are Svayambhus and cannot be otherwise.Inasmuch as the Anumandra Sudha *Ni*, produced on the secondwire by the second fret, is of the same value as the Mandra Sudha*Ni*, produced on the fourth wire by the fourth fret; all the Svaras,produced (on all the four wires) by the fourth fret are determinedto be Svayambhus; and they cannot be otherwise. Inasmuch,again, as the Anumandra Chyuthashadja *Ni*, produced on thesecond wire by the fourth fret, is of the same value as the MandraChyuthashadja *Ni*, produced on the fourth wire by the sixth fret;all the Svaras produced (on all the four wires) by the sixth fretare determined to be Svayambhus; and they cannot truly be other-wise. The Sa-Ma Svaras, produced (on the first three wires)by the fifth fret, are all Svayambhus. Inasmuch, again, as theMandra Kaisiki *Ni*, produced on the fourth wire by the fifth fret,is of the same value as the Anumandra Kaisiki *Ni*, produced onthe second wire by the third fret; all the Svaras, produced (on allthe wires) by the third fret are Svayambhus. Inasmuch, furtheragain, as the Mandra Sudha *Dha*, produced on the fourth wire bythe third fret, is of the same value as the Anumandra Sudha *Dha,*produced on the second wire by the first fret; all the Svaras havebeen shewn to be of definitely determined values. In this mannerRâmâmâtya determined the values of all the Svaras produced onall the four wires by all the six frets.  
  62-64. In the same manner, suitable frets were fixed bylearned men in the other registers also, such as, Madhyathâra andAnuthâra. The Svaras, produced on the frets of the MadhyaRegister and above are agreeable and therefore accepted inpractice, only if they are produced on the fourth wire but not onthe other three wires.  
  64-72. While all the hitherto-discussed Svaras have beenfourteen in number, the theory of twelve Svaras will now beexplained, without any confusion. First, the question as to whya couple of frets was not fixed to produce Kâkali *Ni* and Anthara*Ga* may be taken up.If two frets were fixed to produce Kâkali*Ni* and Anthara *Ga*, the resulting sound is a disagreeable beat;and hence the absence of the two frets to produce those twoSvaras. How then can they be otherwise produced? Thelearned musicians are of opinion that Kâkali *Ni* can be produced,in a way, even by the Chyutha Madhyama *Ga-*fret. In fact, allthe Râgas, in which Kâkali *Ni* and Anthara *Ga* play any part, maylikewise be sung.Some practical musicians consider Chyuthamadhyama *Ga* and Chyuthashadja *Ni* as the representativesrespectively of Anthara *Ga* and Kâkali *Ni*, on account of the verysmall difference in sound between them. Thus has Shârngadêv expressed himself agreeably that Kâkali *Ni* and Anthara *Ga* are of occasional use. This is the view of the practical musicians regarding the characteristics of Sudha Mêla Vina.

*(b) Madhyamêla Vina*

   73-76. The characteristics of Madhyamêla Vina are hereinclearly given. If the first wire of the Sudha Mêla Vina producesAnumandra *Pa;* the second wire, Mandra *Sa*; the third wireMandra *Pa*; and the fourth wire, Madhya *Sa*; then, MadhyaMêla-Vina is the result. As for the three side-wires, theirarrangement should be such as to produce the same sound as theupper-wires.

(c) *Achyutharâja Mêla Vina*

  77-78. Then, the Achyutha Bhûpâla Mêla Vina is described. If the fourth upper wire of the Sudha Mêla Vina producesMandra *Pa* and the other three upper wires produce the sameSvaras, as in the case of Sudha Mêla Vina; then, Achyuthamahârâja Mêla Vina is declared by me to be the result. As for theside-wires, an additional Madhya *Pa*-wire should be tacked on.

**CHHAPTER IV**  
*MÊLA*

  1-2  Having thus explained the characteristics of the threekinds of the *Vina*, I shall duly proceed to speak about the*Mêlas*, which cause their respective *Râgas* to be formed andwhich are distinguished by Râga-names, coined after the fashionof the languages prevailing in various provinces

*The Name of the first Mêla*

  3. I shall first specify the names of the Mêlas and thenexplain their characteristics. Of all the Mêlas, MUKHÂRI isthe first.

*The Names of other Mêlas*

 4-9. Other Mêlas are as follows:-Mâlavagowla, Srirâga,Sâranganâta, Hindôla, Sudharâmakriya, Desâkshi, Kannadagowla,Sudhanâti, Âhari, Nâdarâmakriya, Sudhavarâli, Rithigowla,Vasanthabhairavi, Kedaragowla, Hêjujji, Sâmavarâli, Rêvagupthi,Sâmantha, and Kâmbhoji. Thus, there are twenty Mêlas.

*The Characteristics of the twenty Mêlas*

  9-10, And their characteristics are explained thus :-

*(1) Mukhâri*

  The Mêla of ‘Mukhâri' consists of seven *Sudha* svaras. According to the learned Shârngadêv, Mukhâri and a few Grâma- Râgas are deemed to be Sudha.

(2) *Mâlavagowla*

  11-12. Râmâmatya characterises, with the approval of those that are well-versed in Râga (-Lakshana), the Mêla of Mâlavagowla' as consisting of these seven svaras, namely, Sudha *Sa*, Sudha *Ri*, Sudha *Ma*, Sudha *Pa,* Sudha *Dha*, Chyuthamadhyama *Ga,* and Chyuthashadja *Ni*.

  13-15. Then do I enumerate some of the Râgas derived from this Mêla (of Mâlavagowla); and they are :-Mâlavagowla, Lalitha, Bowli, Sourashtra, Gurjari, Mechabowli, Palamanjari, Guṅdakri, Sinduramakri, Châyâgowla, Kuranji, Kannadabangâla, Mangalakaisika, and Malhari.

(5) *Hindôla*

  25. The characteristics of Srirâga are equally applicable tothis Mêla of 'Hindôla'; and the only exception is (that instead ofPanchasruti *Dha* of the former) Sudha *Dha* is used (in the latter ).  
  26-27. I now enumerate some of the Râgas derived fromthis Mêla (of Hindôla); and they are:-Hindôla, Mârgahindôla,and Bhûpâla and also a few others.

*(6) Sudharâmakriya*

  27-28 .The Mêla of Sudharâmakriya' consists of theseseven svaras, namely, Sudha *Sa*, Sudha *Ri*, Chyuthamadhyama*Ga*, Chyuthapanchama *Ma*, Sudha *Pa*, Sudha *Dha* and Chyuthashadja *Ni*.

(7) *Désâkshi*

  30-32. The learned Râmâmâtya characterises the Mêla of'Dêsâkshi' as consisting of these seven svaras, namely, Sudha*Sa,* Shadsruthi *Ri*, Chyuthamadhyama *Ga*, Sudha *Ma,* Sudha*Pa*, Panchasruti *Dha,* and Chyuthashadja *N*i. Dêsâkshi andother Râgas are, here and there, the derivatives of this Mêla (of  
Dêsâkshi).

(8) *Kannadagowla*

   33-34. As between the characteristics of Dêsâkshi andKannadagowla, there is one point of difference, namely, the latter(Kannadagowla) has Kaisiki *Ni*, as practised by the(instead of Chyuthashadja *Ni* of Dêsâkshi).

  34-36. I now enumerate some of the Râgas, derived fromthisMêla(ofKannadagowla); andtheyare:-Kannadagowla,Ghantârava, Sudhabangâla, Châyânâta, Thurushkathôdi, Nâgadhvani, and Dêvakriya and a few others.

*(10) Âhari*

  39-40 The Mêla of 'Ahari' consists of these svaras,namely, Sudha *Sa,* Panchasruti *Ri,* Sâdhârana *Ga*, Sudha *Ma*,Sudha *Pa*, Sudha *Dha,* and Chyuthashadja *Ni.* Âhari and otherRâgas are the derivatives of this Mêla (of Âhari).

*(11) Nâdarâmakriya*

  41-42. The Mêla of Nâdarâmakriya' consists of thesesvaras, namely, Sudha *Sa*, Sudha *Ri,* Sâdhârana *Ga*, Sudha *Ma,*Sudha *Pa*, Sudha *Dha,* andChyuthashadja *Ni.* Nâdarâmakriyaand other Râgas are the derivatives, here and there, of this Mêla(of Nâdarâmakriya).

*(12) Sudhavarâli*

  43-45. The Mêla of Sudhavarâli' consists of these svaras,namely, Sudha *Sa*, Sudha *Ri*, Sudha *Ga*, Chyuthapanchama *Ma*,Sudha *Pa,* Sudha *Dha*, and Chyuthashadja *Ni*. Sudhavarâliand other Râgas are, in different provinces, the derivatives ofthis Mêla (of Sudhavarâli).

*(13) Rithigowla*

  45-47. The Mêla of 'Rithigowla' consists of these svaras,namely, Sudha *Sa,* Sudha *Ri,* Sudha *Ga*, Sudha *Ma*, Sudha *Pa*,Panchasruti *Dha,* and Kaisiki *Ni*. Rithigowla and otherRâgas are, according to the views of the musicians, the derivatives of this Mêla (of Rithigowla).

*(14) Vasanthabhairavi*

*Nota Bene*

  52. Having discussed the (above-mentioned) fifteen Mêlas,wherefrom Anthara *Ga* and Kâkali *Ni* were excluded; we shall(now proceed to) deal with the (following) five Mêlas whereinAnthara *Ga* and Kâkali *Ni* will be included.

*(16) Hêjujji—1*

  53-55. The Mêla of Hêjujji' consists of these svaras,namely, Sudha *Sa*, Sudha *Ri*, Anthara *Ga*, Sudha *Ma*, Sudha*Pa*, Sudha *Dha*, and Kâkali *Ni.* Hijujji (Hêjujji) and otherRâgas and a few Grâma-Râgas too are the derivatives of thisMêla (of Hêjujji). This Mêla of the Gândharva (or Mârga) type,which comes under the category of the five (special) Mêlas, hasbeen approved of by Shârngadêv.

*(17) Sâmavarâli—2*

  55-57. The Mêla of Sâmavarâli' consists of these svaras,namely, Sudha *Sa,* Sudha *Ri,* Sudha *Ga*, Sudha *Ma*, Sudha *Pa,*Sudha *Dha*, and Kâkali *Ni*. Sâmavarâli, Thôndi, Purvavarâli,and a few Grâma-Ragas are, according to Shârngadêv, who waswell-versed in the Mârga-music, the derivatives of this Mêla (ofSâmavarâli).

*(18) Rêvagupthi-3*

  58-59. The Mêla of 'Rêvagupthi' consists of these sevensvaras, namely, Sudha *Sa*, Sudha *Ri,* Anthara *Ga*, Sudha *Ma,*Sudha *Pa,* Sudha *Dha*, and Sudha *Ni*. Rêvagupthi and a fewSudha Râgas are mentioned by Shârngadêv, in his Ratnâkara, asderivatives of this Mêla (of Rêvagupthi).

*(2o) Kâmbhôji–5*

  61-62. The Mêla of 'Kambhôji' consists of these svaras,namely, Sudha *Sa*, Panchasruti *Ri,* Anthara *Ga,* Sudha *Ma*,Sudha *Pa*, Panchasruti *Dha*, and Kâkali *Ni.* Kâmbhôji andother Râgas are the derivatives of this Mêla (of Kâmbhôji).

*A Controversy*

  63-70.The characteristics of these twenty Mêlas have been,in the main, described. (As for the controversy that has arisen,namely, Iwhether there are twenty or fifteen Mêlas)---I nowproceed to state both the sides of the question, with the help of aVina. If, on the one hand, Anthara *Ga* and Kâkali *Ni* are takeninto account; there surely arise twenty Mêlas. But if, on theother hand, Chyuthamadhyama *Ga* and Chyuthashadja *Ni* aredeemed to represent Anthara *Ga* and Kâkali *Ni* respectively;there arise only fifteen Mêlas. In the latter case, the remainingfive Mêlas must be deemed to be implied in the fifteen. For,Hêjujji is implied in Vasanthabhairavi; Sâmavarâli, in Sudhavarâli;Rêvagupthi, in Bowli; Sâmantha, in Kannadagowla; andKâmbhôji, in Sâranganâta. If the (above-mentioned) theory ofrepresentation is accepted, there are only fifteen Mêlas fromMukhâri to Kêdâragowla, both inclusive.

**CHAPTER V**

**RÂGA**

 15-16. These mixed Râgas which intervene between the superiorand the middling ones-that is to say, these *inferior* Râgas are plentiful but calculated only to dazzle (and not illumine) the masses. They are further unsuitable for compositions like Tâya, Âlâpa, and Prabandha. Hence it is that the musicians do not countenance them.

*The Characteristics of the Râgas*

 17. All the Dêsi Râgas are those of Shadjagrâma and have each its Graha, Amsa, Nyâsa, Mandra, and so forth. Further, they fall into three divisions-Oudava, Shâdava, and Sampurna.

  18-20. Whether these Dêsi Râgas are used, as such, in allthe (three kinds of) râgas or not, I shall now in conformity withthe theory and practice of music, state a few of the characteristics of the twenty*superior*Râgaswhicharefreefrom
