tattvavivekah

नमः श्रीशङ्करानन्दगुरुपादाम्बुजन्मने।

सविलासमहामोहग्राहग्रासैककर्मणे॥ १॥

prathamaḥ paricchedaḥ\।

namaḥ śrīšankarānandagurupādāmbujanmane \।

savilāsamahāmohagrāhagrāsaikakarmane \।\। 1\।\।

1\. Salutation to the lotus feet of my Guru Sri Sankarananda

whose only work is to destroy the monster of primal nescience together with its effect, the phenomenal universe

तत्पादाम्बुरुहद्वन्द्वसेवानिर्मलचेतसाम्।

सुखबोधाय तत्त्वस्य विवेकोऽयं विधीयते॥२॥

tatpādāmburuhadvandvasevānirmalacetasām \।

sukhabodhaya tattvasya viveko'yam vidhiyate \।\। 2\।\।

2\. This discussion about the discrimination of Truth

(Brahman) (from untruth) is being initiated for the easy

understanding of those whose hearts have been purified by

service to the pair of lotus feet of the Teacher.  
शब्दस्पर्शादयो वेद्या वैचित्र्याज्जागरे पृथक् ।

ततोविभक्ता तत्संविदैक्यरूप्यान्न भिद्यते॥ ३॥

śabdasparśādayo vedyā vaicitryājjāgare prthak \।

tatovibhaktā tatsamvidaikyarūpyānna bhidyate \।\। 3\।\।\।

3\. The objects of knowledge, viz., sound, touch, etc., which

are perceived in the waking state, are different from each

other because of their peculiarities; but the consciousness of

these, which is different from them, does not differ because  

of its homogeneity.

तथा स्वप्नेऽत्र वेद्यन्तु न स्थिरं जागरे स्थिरम्।

तद्भेदोऽतस्तयोः संविदेकरूपा न भिद्यते॥ ४॥

tathā svapne'tra vedyantu na sthiram jāgare sthiram \।

tadbhedo'tastayoḥ samvidekarūpā na bhidyate \।\। 4\।\।

4\. Similar is the case in the dream state. Here the perceived

objects are transient and in the waking state they seem

permanent. So there is difference between them. But the

(perceiving) consciousness in both the states does not differ. It is homogeneous.  

सुप्तोत्थितस्य सौषुप्ततमोबोधो भवेत्स्मृतिः।

सा चावबुद्धविषयावबुद्धं तत्तदा ततः॥ ५॥

suptottthitasya sauşuptatamobodho bhavetsmộtiḥ \।

sā cāvabuddhavişayāvabuddham tattadā tataḥ \।\। 5\।\।\।

5\. A person awaking from deep sleep consciously

remembers his lack of perception during that state.

Remembrance consists of objects experienced earlier. It is

therefore clear that even in deep sleep 'want of knowledge is perceived.

सबोधोविषयाद्भिन्नो न बोधात्स्वप्नबोधवत्।

एवं स्थानत्रयेऽप्येका संवित्तद्वदिनान्तरे॥ ६॥

sabodhovişayādbhinno na bodhātsvapnabodhavat \।

evam sthanatraye'pyeka samvittadvaddinantare \।\। 6\।\।

6\. This consciousness (in the deep sleep state) is indeed

distinct from the object (here, ignorance), but not from itself,

as is the consciousness in the state of dream. Thus in all the

three states the consciousness (being homogeneous) is the

same. It is so in other days too.  

मासाब्दायुगकल्पेषु गतागम्येष्वनेकधा।

नोदेति नास्तमेत्येका संविदेषा स्वयंप्रभा॥ ७॥

māsābdāyugakalpeșu gatāgamyeşvanekadhā \।\।

nodeti nāstametyekā samvideşā svayamprabhā \।\। 7\।\।\।

6\. This consciousness (in the deep sleep state) is indeed

distinct from the object (here, ignorance), but not from itself,

as is the consciousness in the state of dream. Thus in all the

three states the consciousness (being homogeneous) is the

same. It is so in other days too.

इयमात्मा परानन्दः परप्रेमास्पदं यतः।

मा न भुवं हि भूयासमिति प्रेमात्मनीक्श्यते॥ ८॥

iyamātmā parānandaḥ parapremāspadam yataḥ \।

mā na bhuvam hi bhūyāsamiti premātmanīkśyate \।\। 8\।\।

6\. This consciousness (in the deep sleep state) is indeed

distinct from the object (here, ignorance), but not from itself,

as is the consciousness in the state of dream. Thus in all the

three states the consciousness (being homogeneous) is the

same. It is so in other days too.  

तत्प्रेमात्मार्थमन्यत्र नैवमन्यार्थमात्मनि।

अतस्तत्परमन्तेन परमानन्दतात्मनः॥ ९॥

tatpremātmārthamanyatra naivamanyārthamātmani \।

atastatparamantena paramanandatatmanah \।\। 9\।\।

9\. Others are loved for the sake of the Self, but the Self is

loved for none other. Therefore the love for the Self is the

highest. Hence the Self is of the nature of the highest bliss.

इत्थं सच्चित्परानन्द आत्मा युक्त्या तथाविधम्।

परं ब्रह्म तयोश्चैक्यं श्रुत्यन्तेषूपदिश्यते॥ १०॥

ittham saccitparānanda ātmā yuktyā tathāvidham \।

param brahma tayoścaikyam śrutyanteșūpadiśyate \।\। 10\।\।

10\. In this way, it is established by reasoning that the

individual Self is of the nature of existence, consciousness

and bliss. Similar is the supreme Brahman. The identity of

the two is taught in the Upanishads.  

अभाने न परं प्रेम भाने न विषयस्पृहा।

अतोभानेऽप्यभाताऽसौ परमानन्दतात्मनः॥ ११॥

abhāne na param prema bhāne na visayaspěhā\।

atobhāne'pyabhātā sau paramānandatātmanaḥ \।\। 11\।\।

11\. If the supreme bliss of the Self is not known, there

cannot be the highest love for it. (But it is there). If it is

known, there cannot be attraction for worldly objects

(That too is there). So we say, this blissful nature of the Self

though revealed, is not strictly speaking) revealed.

अध्येतृवर्गमध्यस्थ पुत्राध्ययन शब्दवत्।

भानेऽप्यभानं भानस्य प्रतिबन्धेन युज्यते॥ १२॥

adhyetsvargamadhyastha putrādhyayana sabdavat।

bhāne'pyabhānam bhānasya pratibandhena yujyate \।\। 12\।\।

12\. A father may distinguish the voice of his son chanting

(the Vedas) in chorus with a number of pupils but may fail to

note its peculiarities, due to an obstruction viz., its having

been mingled with other voices. Similar is the case with bliss.

Because of observation, it is proper to say that the bliss 'is

known yet unknown'.  

प्रतिबन्धोऽस्ति भातीति व्यवहारार्हवस्तुनि।

तं निरस्य विरुद्धस्य तस्योत्पादनमुच्यते॥ १३॥

pratibandho'sti bhātīti vyavahārārhavastuni \।

tam nirasya viruddhasya tasyotpadanamucyate \।\। 13\।\।

13\. Our experience of the articles of everyday use is that

they 'exist', they 'reveal'. Now an obstruction is that which

stultifies this experience of existence and revelation and

produces the counter-experience that they are not existing,

they are not revealing.

तस्य हेतुः समानाभिहारः पुत्रध्वनिश्रुतौ।

इहानादिरवियैव व्यामोहैकनिबन्धनम्॥ १४॥

tasya hetuḥ samānābhihārah putradhvaniśrutau।

ihānādiravidyaiva vyāmohaikanibandhanam \।\। 14\।\।

14\. In the above illustration the cause of the obstruction to

the voice of the son being fully recognized is the chorus of

voices of all the boys. Hence the one cause of all contrary

experiences is indeed the beginningless Avidya.  

चिदानन्दमयब्रह्मप्रतिबिम्बसमन्विता।

तमोरजःसत्त्वगुणा प्रकृतिविविधा च सा॥ १५॥

cidānandamayabrahmapratibimbasamanvitā \।

tamorajahsattvaguna prakrtirdvividhā ca sā \।\। 15\।\।

15\. Prakriti (i.e. primordial substance) is that in which there

is the reflection of Brahman, that is pure consciousness and

bliss and is composed of sattva, rajas and tamas (in a state of homogeneity)

It is of two kinds.

सत्त्वशुद्धाविशुद्धिभ्यां मायाऽविद्य च ते मते।

मायाबिम्बोवशीकृत्य तां स्यात्सर्वज्ञ ईश्वरः॥ १६॥

sattvasuddhāvisuddhibhyām māyā'vidye ca te mate \।

māyābimbovašīkstya tām syātsarvajña īśvaraḥ \।\। 16\॥

16\. When the element of sattva is pure, Prakriti is known as

Maya; when impure (being mixed up with rajas and tamas)

it is called Avidya. Brahman, reflected in Maya, is known as

the omniscient Isvara, who controls Maya.

अविद्यावशगस्त्वन्यस्तद्वैचित्र्यादनेकधा।

सा कारणशरीरं स्यात्प्राज्ञस्तत्राभिमानवान्॥ १७॥

avidyāvasagastvanyastadvaicitryādanekadhā\।

sā kāraṇaśarīram syātprājñastatrābhimānavān \।\। 17\।\।

17\. But the other (i.e. the Jiva, which is Brahman reflected in

Avidya) is subjected to Avidya (impure sattva). The Jiva is

of different grades due to (degrees of) admixture (of rajas

and tamas with sattva). The Avidya (nescience) is the causal

body. When the Jiva identifies himself with this causal body

he is called Prajna.

तमः प्रधानप्रकृतेस्तद्भोगायेश्वराज्ञया।

वियत्पवनतेजोऽम्बु भुवोभूतानि जज्ञिरे॥ १८॥

tamah pradhānaprakstestadbhogāyeśvarājñayā।

viyatpavanatejo'mbu bhuvobhūtāni jajñire \।\।18\।\।

18\. At the command of Isvara (and) for the experience of

Prajna the five subtle elements, ether, air, fire, water and

earth, arose from the part of Prakriti in which tamas predominates.  

सत्त्वांशैः पञ्चभिस्तेषां क्रमाद्धीन्द्रियपञ्चकम्।

श्रोत्रत्वगक्शिरसनघ्राणाख्यामुपजायते॥ १९॥

sattvāmśaiḥ pañcabhisteşām kramāddhīndriyapañcakam।

śrotratvagakširasanaghrāņākhyāmupajāyate \।\। 19\।\।

19\. From the sattva part of the five subtle elements of

Prakriti arose in turn the five subtle sensory organs of

hearing, touch, sight, taste and smell.

तैरन्तःकरणं सर्वैर्वृत्तिभेदेन तद्विधा।

मनोविमर्शरूपं स्याद्बुद्धिः स्यान्निश्चयात्मिका॥ २०॥

tairantahkaranam sarvairvṛttibhedena taddvidhā\।

manovimarsarūpam syādbuddhiḥ syānniscayātmikā \।\।20\।\।

20\. From a combination of them all (i.e. sattva portions of

the five subtle elements) arose the organ of inner

conception called antahkarana. Due to difference of function

it is divided into two. Manas (mind) is that aspect whose

function is doubting and buddhi (intellect) is that whose

functions are discrimination and determination.  

रजोंऽशैः पञ्चभिस्तेषां क्रमात्कर्मेन्द्रियाणि तु।

वाक्पाणिपादपायूपस्थाभिधानानि जज्ञिरे॥ २१॥

rajom'śaiḥ pañcabhistesām kramātkarmendriyāņi tu \।

vākpāṇipādapāyūpasthābhidhānāni jajñire \।\।21\।\।

21\. From the rajas portion of the five elements arose in turn

the organs of actions known as the organ of speech, the

hands, the feet, and the organs of excretion and generation.

तैः सर्वैः सहितैः प्राणोवृत्तिभेदात्स पञ्चधा।

प्राणोऽपानः समानश्चोदानव्यानौ च ते पुनः॥ २२॥

taiḥ sarvaiḥ sahitaiḥ prāņovịttibhedātsa pañcadhā \।

prāņo'pānaḥ samānaścodānavyānau ca te punaḥ \।\।22\।\।

22\. From a combination of them all (i.e. the rajas portions of

the five subtle elements) arose the vital air (Prana). Again,

due to difference of function it is divided into five. They are

Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana and Vyana.  

बुद्धिकर्मेन्द्रियप्राणपञ्चकैर्मनसा धिया।

शरीरं सप्तदशभिः सूक्श्मं तल्लिङ्गमुच्यते॥ २३॥

buddhikarmendriyaprāņapañcakairmanasā dhiya \।

śarīram saptadaśabhiḥ sūkśmam tallingamucyate \।\। 23\।\।

23\. The five sensory organs, the five organs of action, the

five vital airs, mind and intellect, all the seventeen together

from the subtle body, which is called the Suksma or linga sarira.

प्राज्ञस्तत्राभिमानेन तैजसत्वं प्रपद्यते।

हिरण्यगर्भतामीशस्तयोर्व्यष्टिसमष्टिता॥ २४॥

prājñastatrābhimānena taijasatvaṁ prapadyate \।

hiranyagarbhatamisastayorvyastisamastita \।\। 24\।\।

24\. By identifying himself with the subtle body (and thinking

it to be his own), Prajna becomes known as Taijasa, and

Isvara as Hiranyagarbha. Their difference is the one

between the individual and the collective (i.e. one is

identified with a single subtle body and the other with the

totality of subtle bodies).  

समष्टिरीशः सर्वेषां स्वात्मतादात्म्यवेदनात्।

तदभावात्ततोऽन्ये तु कथ्यन्ते व्यष्टिसंज्ञया॥ २५॥

samaştirīśaḥ sarvesām svātmatādātmyavedanāt।

tadabhāvāttato'nye tu kathyante vyaşțisamjñayā \।\। 25\।\।

25\. Isvara (as Hiranyagarbha) is called totality because of

his sense of identification with all the subtle bodies (of the

universe). The other (the Taijasa) is called 'individual"

because it lacks this knowledge (and is conscious only of his

self, being identified with his subtle body\]

॥   तद्भोगाय पुनभोग्यभोगायतनजन्मने।

पञ्चीकरोति भगवान्प्रत्येकं वियदादिकम्॥ २६॥

tadbhogāya punarbhogyabhogāyatanajanmane \।

pancikaroti bhagavanpratyekam viyadadikam \।\। 26\।\।

26\. To provide the Jivas with objects of enjoyment and make

the bodies fit for such enjoyment, the all-powerful Isvara

has made each of the (subtle) elements partake of the

nature of all others.

द्विधा विधाय चैकैकं चतुर्धा प्रथमं पुनः।

स्वस्वेतरद्वितीयांशैर्योजनात्पञ्च पञ्च ते॥ २७॥

dvidhā vidhāya caikaikam caturdhā prathamaṁ punaḥ \।

svasvetaradvitīyāmśairyojanātpañca pañca te \।\। 27\।\।

27\. Dividing each element into two equal halves and one half

of each again into four (equal parts) the Lord mixed the

subtle elements so that each gross element thus formed

should contain one half of its own peculiar nature and one

eighth of that of each of the other four.

तैरण्डस्तत्र भवनभोग्यभोगाश्रयोद्भवः।

हिरण्यगर्भः स्थूलेऽस्मिन्देहे वैश्वानरो भवेत्।

तैजसा विश्वतां याता देव तिर्यङ्नरादयः॥ २८॥

tairandastatra bhuvanabhogyabhogāśrayodbhavaḥ \।\।

hiranyagarbhah sthūle'smindehe vaisvānaro bhavet \।

taijasā viśvatām yātā deva tiryannarādayah \।\। 28\।\।

28\. From these composite elements the cosmic egg arose,

and from it evolved all the worlds as well as all the objects

of experience and the bodies in which the experience take

place. When Hiranyagarbha identifies himself with the

totality of gross bodies he is known as Vaisvanara; when

Taijasas do so with individual gross bodies (e.g.) of the

devas, men or lower animals, they are known as Visvas.  

ते पराग्दर्शिनः प्रत्यक्तत्त्वबोधविवर्जिताः॥ २९॥

te parāgdarsinaḥ pratyaktattvabodhavivarjitāḥ \।\। 29\।\।

29\. They see only external things and are devoid of the

knowledge of their true inner nature. They perform actions

for enjoyment, and again they enjoy for performing action.

कुर्वते कर्म भोगाय कर्म कर्तुं च भुञ्जते।

नद्यां कीटा इवावर्तादावर्तान्तरमाशु ते।

व्रजन्तो जन्मनो जन्म लभन्ते नैव निर्वृतिम्॥ ३०॥

kurvate karma bhogāya karma kartum ca bhuñjate \।

nadyāṁ kītā ivāvartādāvartāntaramāśu te।

vrajanto janmano janma labhante naiva nirvrtim \।\। 30\।\।

30\. They go from birth to birth, as worms that have slipped

into a river are swept from one whirlpool to another and

never attain peace.

सत्कर्मपरिपाकात्ते करुणानिधिनोद्धृताः।

प्राप्य तीरतरुच्छायां विश्राम्यन्ति यथासुखम्॥ ३१॥

satkarmaparipākātte karuņānidhinoddhịtāḥ \।

prāpya tīratarucchāyām viśramyanti yathāsukham \।\।31\।\।

31\. When the good deeds performed by them in past births

bear fruit, the worms enjoy rest being lifted from the river

by a compassionate person and placed under the shade of a

tree on the bank.

उपदेशमवाप्यैवमाचार्यात्तत्त्वदर्शिनः।

पञ्चकोषविवेकेन लभन्ते निर्वृतिं पराम्॥ ३२॥

upadeśamavāpyaivamācāryāttattvadarśinaḥ

pancakosavivekena labhante nirvrtim param \।\। 32\।\।

32\. Similarly, the Jivas (finding themselves in the whirlpool

of samsara), receive the appropriate initiation from a

teacher who himself has realised Brahman, and

differentiating the Self from its five sheaths attain the

supreme bliss of release.

अन्नं प्राणो मनो बुद्धिरानन्दश्चेति पञ्च ते।

कोषास्तैरावृतः स्वात्मा विस्मृत्या संसृतिं व्रजेत्॥ ३३॥

annam prāņo mano buddhirānandaśceti pañca te।

kosāstairavrtah svātmā vismrtya samsrtim vrajet \।\। 33\।\।

33\. The five sheaths of the Self are those of the food, the

vital air, the mind, the intellect and bliss. Enveloped in them,

it forgets its real nature and becomes subject to transmigration.

स्यात्पञ्चीकृतभूतोत्थो देहः स्थूलोऽन्न संज्ञकः।

लिङ्गे तु राजसैः प्राणैः प्राणः कर्मेन्द्रियैः सह॥ ३४॥

syātpañcīkstabhūtottho dehaḥ sthūlo'nna samjñakah ।

linge tu rājasаih prāņaih prāṇaḥ karmendriyaiḥ saha \।\।34\॥

34. The gross body which is the product of the

quintuplicated elements is known as the food sheath. That

portion of the subtle body which is composed of the five vital

airs and the five organs of action, and which is the effect of

the rajas aspect of Prakriti is called the vital sheath.  

सात्त्विकै/न्द्रियैः साकं विमर्षात्मा मनोमयः।

तैरेव साकं विज्ञानमयोधीनिश्चयात्मिका॥ ३५॥

sāttvikairdhīndriyaiḥ sākam vimarşātmā manomayah \।

taireva sākam vijñānamayodhīrniscayātmikā \।\।35\।\।

35. The doubting mind and the five sensory organs, which

are the effect of Sattva, make up the mind sheath. The

determining intellect and the sensory organs make up the

intellect sheath.

कारणे सत्त्वमानन्दमयोमोदादिवृत्तिभिः।

तत्तत्कोषैस्तु तादात्म्यादात्मा तत्तन्मयो भवेत्॥ ३६॥

kāraṇe sattvamānandamayomodādivsttibhiḥ \।

tattatkoşaistu tādātmyādātmā tattanmayo bhavet \।\। 36\।\।

36\. The impure Sattva which is in the causal body, along

with joy and other Vrittis (mental modifications), is called

the bliss sheath. Due to identification with the different

sheaths, the Self assumes their respective natures.  

अन्वयव्यतिरेकाभ्यां पञ्चकोष विवेकतः।

स्वात्मानं तत उद्धृत्य परं ब्रह्म प्रपद्यते॥ ३७॥

anvayavyatirekābhyām pañcakosa vivekataḥ \।

svātmānam tata uddhștya param brahma prapadyate \।\। 37\।\।

37\. By differentiating the Self from the five sheaths through

the method of distinguishing between the variable and the

invariable, one can draw out one's own Self from the five

sheaths and attain the supreme Brahman.

अभाने स्थूलदेहस्य स्वप्ने यद्भानमात्मनः।

सोऽन्वयो व्यतिरेकस्तद्भानेऽन्यानवभासनम्॥ ३८॥

abhāne sthūladehasya svapne yadbhānamātmanah \।

so'nvayo vyatirekastadbhāne'nyānavabhāsanam \।\।38\।\।

38\. The physical body present in one's consciousness is

absent in the dreaming state, but the witnessing element,

pure consciousness, persists (in both the waking and

dreaming states). This is the invariable presence (anvaya) of

the Self. Though the self is perceived, the physical body is

not; so the latter is a variable factor.  

लिङ्गभाने सुषुप्तौ स्यादात्मनो भानमन्वयः।

व्यतिरेकस्तु तद्भाने लिङ्गस्याभानमुच्यते॥ ३९॥

lingabhāne sușuptau syādātmano bhānamanvayaḥ \।

vyatirekastu tadbhāne lingasyābhānamucyate \।\। 39\।\।

39\. Similarly, in the state of deep sleep, the subtle body is

not perceived, but the Self invariably witnesses that state

While the self persists in all states the subtle body is not

perceived in deep sleep and so it is called a variable factor

तद्विवेकाद्विविक्ताः स्युः कोषाः प्राणमनोधियः।

ते हि तत्र गुणावस्थाभेदमात्रात्पृथक्कृताः॥ ४०॥

tadvivekādviviktāḥ syuḥ koşāḥ prāṇamanodhiyah \।

te hi tatra guṇāvasthābhedamātrātprthakkřtāḥ \।\। 40\।\।

40\. By discrimination of the subtle body (and recognition of

its variable, transient character), the sheaths of the mind,

intellect, and vital airs are understood to be different from

the Self, for the sheaths are conditions of the three gunas,

and differ from each other (qualitatively and quantitatively).

सुषुप्त्यभाने भानन्तु समाधावात्मनोऽन्वयः।

व्यतिरेकस्त्वात्मभाने सुषुप्त्यनवभासनम्॥ ४१ ॥

susuptyabhāne bhānantu samādhāvātmano'nvayah \।

vyatirekastvātmabhāne susuptyanavabhāsanam \।\। 41\।\।

41\. Avidya (manifested as the causal body of bliss sheath) is

negated in the state of deep meditation (in which neither

subject nor object is experienced), but the Self persists in

that state, so it is the invariable factor. But the causal body

is a variable factor, for though the Self persists, it does not.

यथामुजादिषीकैवमात्मा युक्त्या समुद्धृतः।

शरीरत्रितयाधीरैः परं ब्रह्मैव जायते॥ ४२॥

yathāmuñjādisīkaivamātmā yuktyā samuddhệtah

śarīratritayāddhīraih param brahmaiva jāyate \।\। 42\।\।

42\. As the slender, internal pith of munja grass can be

detached from its coarse external covering, so the Self can

be distinguished through reasoning from the three bodies

(or the five sheaths). Then the Self is recognised as the

supreme consciousness.

परापरात्मनोरेवं युक्त्या सम्भावितैकता।

तत्त्वमस्यादिवाक्यैः सा भागत्यागेन लक्ष्यते॥ ४३॥

parāparātmanorevam yuktyā sambhāvitaikatā \।

tattvamasyādivākyaiḥ sā bhāgatyāgena lakṣyate \।\। 43\।\।

43\. In this way the identity of Brahman and Jiva is

demonstrated through reasoning. This identity is taught in

the sacred texts in sentences such as 'That thou art'. Their

method of explaining the truth is through the elimination of

incongruous attributes.

जगतो यदुपादानं मायामादाय तामसीम्।

निमित्तं शुद्धसत्त्वां तामुच्यते ब्रह्म तगिरा॥ ४४॥

jagato yadupādānam māyāmādāya tāmasīm \।

nimittam suddhasattvam tamucyate brahma tadgira \।\। 44\।\।

44\. Brahman becomes the material and efficient cause of the

world when associated with those aspects of Maya in which

there is a predominance of tamas and sattva respectively.

This Brahman is referred to as 'That' in the text 'That thou

art'.  

यदा मलिनसत्त्वां तां कामकर्मादिदूषितम्।

आदत्ते तत्परं ब्रह्म त्वं पदेन तदोच्यते॥ ४५॥

yadā malinasattvām tām kāmakarmādidūsitam

ādatte tatparam brahma tvam padena tadocyate \।\। 45\।\।

45\. When the supreme Brahman superimposes on Itself

Avidya, that is, sattva mixed with rajas and tamas, creating

desires and activities in It, then it is referred to as 'thou'.

त्रितयीमपि तां मुक्त्वा परस्परविरोधिनीम्।

अखण्डं सच्चिदानन्दं महावाक्येन लक्ष्यते॥ ४६॥

tritayīmapi tām muktvā parasparavirodhinīm \।

akhandam saccidānandam mahāvākyena lakṣyate \।\।46\।\।

46\. When the three mutually contradictory aspects of Maya

are rejected, there remains the one individual Brahman

whose nature is existence, consciousness and bliss. This is

pointed out by the great saying 'That thou art'.  

सोऽयमित्यादिवाक्येषु विरोधात्तदिदन्त्वयोः।

त्यागेन भागयोरेक आश्रयो लक्ष्यते यथा॥ ४७॥

so'yamityādivākyeșu virodhāttadidantvayoḥ \।

tyāgena bhāgayoreka āśrayo lakşyate yathā \।\।47\।\।

47\. In the sentence 'This is that Devadatta', 'this' and 'that'

refer to different time, place and circumstances. When the

particular connotations of 'this' and 'that' are rejected,

Devadatta remains as their common basis

मायाविद्ये विहायैवमुपाधी परजीवयोः।

अखण्डं सच्चिदानन्दं परं ब्रह्मैव लक्ष्यते॥ ४८॥

māyāvidye vihāyaivamupādhī parajīvayoḥ \।

akhandam saccidanandam param brahmaiva laksyate \।\। 48\।\।

48\. Similarly, when the adjuncts, Maya and Avidya (the

conflicting connotations in the proposition 'That thou art') of

Brahman, and Jiva, are negated, there remains the

indivisible supreme Brahman, whose nature is existence,

consciousness and bliss.  

सविकल्पस्य लक्ष्यत्वे लक्ष्यस्य स्यादवस्तुता।

निर्विकल्पस्य लक्ष्यत्वं न दृष्टं न च सम्भवि॥ ४९॥

savikalpasya lakṣyatve lakṣyasya syādavastutā\।

nirvikalpasya laksyatvam na drstam na ca sambhavi \।\। 49\।\।

49\. (Objection): If the denoted object (of 'That thou art' i.e.,

Brahman) is with attributes, then it becomes unreal.

Secondly, an object without attributes is neither seen nor is

possible to conceive.

विकल्पो निर्विकल्पस्य सविकल्पस्य वा भवेत्।

आये व्याहतिरन्यत्रानवस्थात्माश्रयादयः॥५०॥

vikalpo nirvikalpasya savikalpasya vā bhavet \।

ādye vyāhatiranyatrānavasthātmāśrayādayah \।\। 50\।\।

50\. (Reply with a counter question): Does the objection you

have raise relate to Brahman without attributes or with

attributes? If the first, you are caught in your own trap; if

the second, it involves logical fallacies of infinite regress,

resting on oneself, etc.  

इदं गुणक्रियाजातिद्रव्यसम्बन्धवस्तुषु।

समन्तेन स्वरूपस्य सर्वमेतदितीष्यताम्॥ ५१ ॥

idam gunakriyājātidravyasambandhavastuşu \।

samantena svarūpasya sarvametaditīşyatām \।\। 51 \।\।

51\. The same logical fallacies may be shown in any object

having substance, species, quality, action, or relationship.

So accept all these attributes as existing (superimposed on)

by the very nature of things.

विकल्पतदभावाभ्यामसंस्पृष्टात्मवस्तुनि।

विकल्पितत्वलक्ष्यत्वसम्बन्धाद्यास्तु कल्पिताः॥ ५२॥

vikalpatadabhāvābhyāmasamsprstātmavastuni \।

vikalpitatvalaksyatvasambandhadyastu kalpitah \।\। 52\।\।

52\. The Self is untouched by doubts about the presence or

absence of associates, connotations and other adventitious

relationships, because they are superimposed on it

phenomenally.  

इत्थं वाक्यैस्तदर्थानुसन्धानं श्रवणं भवेत्।

युक्त्या सम्भावितत्वानुसन्धानं मननन्तु तत्॥ ५३॥

ittham vākyaistadarthānusandhānam śravaṇam bhavet।

yuktyā sambhāvitatvānusandhānaṁ mananantu tat \।\। 53\।\।

53\. The finding out or discovery of the true significance of

the identity of the individual self and the Supreme with the

aid of the great sayings (like Tattvamasi) is what is known

as sravana. And to arrive at the possibility of its validity

through logical reasoning is what is called manana.

ताभ्यां निर्विचिकित्सेऽर्थे चेतसःस्थापितस्य यत्।

एकतानत्वमेतद्धि निदिध्यासनम्च्यते॥ ५४॥

tābhyām nirvicikitse'rthe cetasahsthāpitasya yat

ekatānatvametaddhi nididhyāsanamucyate \।\। 54\।\।

54. And, when by sravana and manana the mind develops a

firm and undoubted conviction, and dwells constantly on the

thus ascertained Self alone, it is called unbroken meditation

(nididhyasana).  

ध्यातृध्याने परित्यज्य क्रमाद्ध्येयैकगोचरम्।

निर्वातदीपवच्चित्तं समाधिरभिधीयते॥ ५५॥

dhyātņdhyāne parityajya kramāddhyeyaikagocaram \।

nirvātadīpavaccittam samādhirabhidhīyate \।\। 55\।\।

55\. When the mind gradually leaves off the ideas of the

meditator and the act of meditation and is merged in the

sole object of meditation. (viz., the Self), and is steady like

the flame of a lamp in a breezeless spot, it is called the

super-conscious state (samadhi).

वृत्तयस्तु तदानीमज्ञाता अप्यात्मगोचराः।

स्मरणादनुमीयन्ते व्युत्थितस्य समुत्थितात्॥ ५६॥

vịttayastu tadānīmajñātā apyātmagocarāḥ \।

smaraņādanumīyante vyutthitasya samutthitāt \।\। 56\।\।

56\. Though in samadhi there is no subjective cognition of

the mental function having the Self as its object, its

continued existence in that state is inferred from the

recollection after coming out of samadhi.

वृत्तीनामनुवृत्तिस्तु प्रयत्नात्प्रथमादपि।

अदृष्टासकृदभ्याससंस्कारः सचिराद्भवेत्॥ ५७॥

vrttīnāmanuvịttistu prayatnātprathamādapi \।

adrstāsakrdabhyāsasamskāraḥ sacirādbhavet \।\। 57\।\।

57. The mind continues to be fixed in Paramatman in the

state of samadhi as a result of the effort of will made prior

to its achievement and helped by the merits of previous

births and the strong impression created through constant

efforts (at getting into samadhi).

यथा दीपो निवातस्थ इत्यादिभिरनेकधा।

भगवानिममेवार्थमर्जुनाय न्यरूपयत्॥ ५८॥

yathā dīpo nivātastha ityādibhiranekadhā\।

bhagavānimamevārthamarjunāya nyarūpayat \।\। 58\॥

58\. The same idea Sri Krishna pointed out to Arjuna in

various ways e.g., when he compares the steady mind to

the flame of a lamp in a breezeless spot.

अनादाविह संसारे सञ्चिताः कर्मकोटयः।

अनेन विलयं यान्ति शुद्धो धर्मो विवर्धते॥ ५९॥

anādāviha samsāre sancitāḥ karmakoțayaḥ \।

anena vilayam yānti śuddho dharmo vivardhate \।\। 59\।\।

59\. As a result of this (nirvikalpa) samadhi millions of results

of actions, accumulated in this beginningless world over past

and present births, are destroyed, and pure dharma (helpful

to the realisation of Truth) grows.

धर्ममेघमिमं प्राहुः समाधिं योगवित्तमाः।

वर्षत्येष यतो धर्मामृतधाराः सहस्रशः॥ ६०॥

dharmameghamimam prāhuḥ samādhim yogavittamāḥ\।

varsatyesa yato dharmāmrtadharah sahasrasah \।\। 60\।\।

60\. The experts in Yoga call this samadhi 'a rain cloud of

dharma' because it pours forth countless showers of the

bliss of dharma.  

अमुना वासनाजाले निःशेषं प्रविलापिते।

समूलोन्मूलिते पुण्यपापाख्ये कर्म सञ्चये॥ ६१ ॥

amunā vāsanājāle niḥśesam pravilāpite \।\।

samūlonmūlite punyapāpākhye karma sañcaye \।\। 61\।\।

61\. The entire network of desires is fully destroyed and the

accumulated actions known as merits and demerits are fully

rooted out by this samadhi.

वाक्यमप्रतिबद्धं सत्प्राक्परोक्शावभासिते।

करामलकवद्बोधमपरोक्ष.प्रसूयते॥६२॥

vākyamapratibaddham satprākparokšāvabhāsite \।

karamalakavadbodhamaparoksam prasāyate \।\। 62\।\।

62\. Then the great dictum, freed from the obstacles (of

doubt and ambiguity), gives rise to a direct realisation of the

Truth, as a fruit in one's palm - Truth which was earlier

comprehended indirectly.  

परोक्शं ब्रह्मविज्ञानं शाब्दं देशिकपूर्वकम्।

बुद्धिपूर्वकृतं पापं कृत्स्नं दहति वह्निवत्॥ ६३॥

paroksam brahmavijñānam śābdam desikapūrvakam

buddhipūrvakstam pāpam krtsnam dahati vahnivat \।\।63\।\।

63\. The knowledge of Brahman obtained indirectly from the

Guru, teaching the meaning of the great dictum, burns up

like fire all sins, committed upto that attainment of

knowledge.

अपरोक्शात्मविज्ञानं शाब्दं देशिकपूर्वकम्।

संसारकारणाज्ञानतमसश्चण्डभास्करः॥ ६४॥

aparoksātmavijñānam śābdam desikapūrvakam।

samsarakaranajnanatamasascandabhaskarah \।\। 64\।\।

64\. The direct realisation of the knowledge of the Self

obtained from the Guru's teaching of the great dictum, is

like the scorching sun, that dispels the very darkness of  
Avidya, the root of all transmigratory existence.  

इत्थं तत्त्वविवेकं विधाय विधिवन्मनः  समाधाय।

विगलितसंसृतिबन्धः प्राप्नोति पारं पदं नरो न हिरात्॥६५॥

ittham tattvavivekam vidhāya vidhivanmanah samādhāya

vigalitasamsștibandhaḥ prāpnoti pāram padam naro na hirāt \।\। 65\।\।

65\. Thus a man distinguishes the Self from the five sheaths,

concentrates the mind on It according to the scriptural

injunctions, becomes free from the bonds of repeated births

and deaths and immediately attains the supreme bliss.

इति तत्त्वविवेकः समाप्तः॥ १॥

iti tattvavivekah samaptah \।\। 1\।\।
