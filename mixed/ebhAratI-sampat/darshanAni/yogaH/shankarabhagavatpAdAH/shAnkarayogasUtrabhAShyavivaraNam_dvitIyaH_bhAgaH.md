In this two-volume work of critically translating the Yogasūtrabhāṣyavivaraṇa (YSBHV) of Śaṅ

kara, the Yogasūtras of Patanjali, and the bhāṣya of Vyāsa, all these three texts have been brought together for the first time. The question of the authorship of YSBHV has been a vexed one and has engaged the attention of scholars for a long time. In this work the authorship problem has been examined in great detail on the basis of both the internal and external evidences. The author has also drawn attention to some specific references to Vācaspati Miśra in the body of the Vivarana. This, hopefully, should settle once and for all the authorship problem.

Preface

This second volume of the Yogasūtrabhāṣyavivaraṇa (YSBHV) is being published almost immediately after the first volume of the YSBHV There is nothing new that I have to say regarding this volume. I would, however, like to remember all those who have helped me in many ways in the writing and completion of this two-volume work and thank them for it.

 I once again dedicate this work to my dear, departed parents, Srimati N.S. Parvathy and Sri T.V. Subramaniam.

Introduction

The introduction to volume I of the *Yogasūtrabhāṣyavivaraṇa* (YSBHV) deals in great detail with the question of the authorship of the YSBHV and the general contents of the entire Vivaraṇa. The interested reader can consult that for those specific details. As the authorship question is an important one plaguing scholars for a long time I would also like to state here, in brief, the conclusion I have reached, based on internal and external evidence, i.e., that the YSBHV is not the work of Śaṅkara the author of the *Brahmasūtrabhāṣya* (BSBH). Based on a line by line reading of the YSBHV I feel confident to state that the Sankara who wrote the Vivaraṇa is certainly not the BSBH author. The style and the contents of the work also lead me to conclude that the author of the YSBHV, who I believe is from Kerala, lived after the twelfth century of the Common Era. Because of some of the references to the Vivaraṇa in the *Gopālikā* of Parameśvara II who belonged to the Payyur Bhaṭṭa family of Kerala, he could not have lived later than the fifteenth century of the Common Era. Thus a Śaṅkara who lived anywhere between the twelfth and the fifteenth centuries of the Common Era could have written this great work in the field of Yoga.

 As for the style, the same format followed in the first volume has been kept in this volume as well. The sūtra, bhāṣya and Vivaraṇa of the Vibhūtipāda and Kaivalyapāda are all brought together in this second volume as was done in the case of the Samādhipāda and Sādhanapāda in the first volume. The sūtra text is printed in 14 point black. The bhāṣya in 12 point black and the Vivaraṇa text in 12 point white. I have used the single text of the Vivaraṇa published by the Madras Government Oriental Series no. 94 in 1952, edited by Śrī P.S. Rama Sastri and Śrī S.R. Krishnamurti Sastri for this work. I have not attempted a fresh translation of the sūtra and bhāṣya texts but have used my earlier translations in the *Yogavārttika* (*Rukmani, Yogavārttika,* vols. I-IV, 1980, 1983, 1987, 1989) with necessary changes, whenever the readings were different. I have, as in volume I, tried to divide the passages both in the bhāṣya and the Vivaraṇa keeping the trend of the arguments unbroken. In the body of the work the sūtra texts have been indicated by italics and the bhāṣya texts can be recognised by double inverted commas. Very often I have not attempted to translate wellknown Sanskrit words.

 While general comments on the YSBHV as a whole have already been given in the introduction to vol. I, I shall just add a few observances from the Vivaraṇa commentary on the Vibhūtipāda and Kaivalyapāda, which form the contents of vol. II. Thus, there is hardly any quotation from śruti or smṛti texts that the author uses to further his points in these two pādas. The only exceptions are some verses from Kumarilabhatta's *Ślokavārttika* under III.17 and a couple of other quotes in the Vibhūtipāda. The Kaivalyapāda-Vivaraṇa has just one quote from the *Bhagavad-gītā* under IV.10. When one looks at the other commentators like Vācaspati Miśra

and Vijñānabhikṣu who, like the Vivaraṇa-Śaṅkara, wrote commentaries on the *Vyāsabhāṣya*, one cannot but notice the lack of references to śruti and smṛti texts in the Vivaraṇa.

 Another feature of the Vivaraṇa is that the author avoids or is not forthcoming with any attempt to interpret the bhāṣya text. Thus opportunities for different interpretation under III.45, IV.4, etc., are not fully exploited by the Vivaraṇa author. He is content with repeating verbatim the bhāṣya-explanation in most of the cases. These are far too many to be mentioned here but they are pointed out in the notes under every sūtra-bhāṣya-vivaraṇa and the interested reader can refer to them in the body of the work. Using the sūtra and bhāṣya given in this edition of the YSBHV the variant readings in the Vivaraṇa have also been pointed out in the notes in the body of the work. The Vivaraṇa author has a monotonous, repetitive style which sometimes jars on the reader. One can refer to the Vivaraṇa under III.13, 15, 17, 45 et seq.

 It must not be concluded from what has been stated above that the Vibhūtipāda and Kaivalyapāda of the Vivaraṇa are without any merit. There are places where the author comes up with interesting observations. Thus under IV.7, for instance, he ridicules the belief in the result of expiatory deeds and again under IV.26 he singles out *aparigraha* for a pride of place amongst the ethical virtues. His summary of the various views on *kaivalya* under IV.34 is very elucidating.

 I will conclude this brief introduction by repeating what I have already said in the introduction to the first volume. "We cannot quarrel with the contents of the YSBHV in which the Vivaraṇakāra passes with flying colours. But it is his style and the man- ner of writing, that put one off and which cannot place him in the same category as the BSBH author."

विभूतिपादः  
Vibhūtipādaḥ

 उक्तानि पञ्च बहिरङ्गसाधनानि। धारणा वक्तव्या–

 The five external means (of yoga) have been mentioned (discussed). Now concentration ( dhāraṇā) is to be mentioned (discussed).

देशबन्धश्चित्तस्य धारणा ॥१॥

 Dhāraṇā is fixing the mind in one place.

 नाभिचक्रे, हृदयपुण्डरीके, मूर्धज्योतिषि, नासिकाग्रे, जिह्वाग्र इत्येवमादिषु देशेषु, बाह्येषु च विषयेषु, चित्तस्य वृत्तिमात्रेण बन्ध इति धारणा ॥१॥

 Dhāraṇā is fixing the mind, through its modification, to places such as the navelcircle, the heart-lotus, the shining centre of the head, the tip of the nose, the tip of the tongue, etc., or to any external object.

 उक्तानि पञ्च बहिरङ्गानि साधनानि सम्प्रज्ञातस्य योगस्य। अधुना अन्तरङ्गं धारणाध्यानसमाधिसमाख्यं साधनत्रयं तस्यैवाभिधीयते। बहिरङ्गान्तरङ्गत्वभेदादेव हि बहिरङ्गसाधनव्याख्यानेनैव पादः परिसमापितः। संहत्यकारित्वाच्च साधनत्रयस्य पृथग्वचनम्। बहिरङ्गसाधनाभिधानानन्तरपर्युपस्थापितान्तरङ्गसाधनप्रतिपादनेन पादसम्बन्धो व्याख्यातः। अस्मिंश्च पादे विभूतयः प्राधान्येन प्रदर्श्यन्त इति च पृथक् (क्त्वादा) पादारम्भः। एतदेव हि समाख्यालाभे कारणमवादिष्म॥

 धारणा वक्तव्या ।प्रत्याहारानन्तरं क्रमोपनीतसन्निधाना धारणा अभिधानीया।देशबन्धश्चित्तस्य धारणा।देशबन्धनं देशबन्धः। कस्य ? चित्तस्य॥

 स्वयमेव च सर्वं व्याचष्टे– नाभिचक्रे नाभिप्रदेशश्चक्रमिव। सर्वे (वायव) अवयवास्तत्र चक्रीभूता इति नाभिचक्रम्।हृदयं पुण्डरीकाकारम्। मूर्धज्योतिषि। मूर्धनाडीद्वारं प्रभास्वरत्वाज्ज्योतिरित्याख्यायते। नासिकाग्रे जिह्वाग्रे इत्येवमादिषु देशेतषु बाह्येषु च विषयेषु चन्द्रादित्यादिषु चित्तं बध्यते॥

 तस्य चित्तस्य इत्येवमादिष्वप्रचलितरूपेण या वृत्तिः सा धारणेत्युच्यते। वृत्तिमात्रेणेति। तद्देशप्रत्ययमात्रेण विक्षेपशून्यतया वर्तत इति ॥१॥

"uktāni. dhanāni” (the five external means ) to saṃprajñāta yoga (have been mentioned). Now the three internal means called dhāraṇā, dhyāna and samādhi of that (saṃprajñāta) are described. It is due to the distinction of being internal and external respectively that the ( earlier) pāda (chapter) was concluded by explaining the external means. As they also have to be done collectively, the three (internal) means are mentioned separately. By indicating the established internal means, after mentioning the external means, the connection between the pādas is described. In this

pāda the perfections will be mainly described; therefore there is commencement of a separate pāda (chapter). This is declared as the reason for its separate mention.

 "dhāraṇā vaktavyā", i.e., after pratyāhāra, dhāraṇā (concentration) which is present next in order (in the list) is to be described. deśabandha *dhāraṇā. deśabandha* is fixing to a place.

 Question—Whose fixing (is talked about)?

 Answer—cittasya, i.e., (the mind's).

 He (Vyāsa) explains everything as follows "nābhicakre" the region of the navel—all the limbs are centred therein; therefore it is called the navel-cakra (circle). The "hṛdaya" (heart) of the shape of a lotus is "hṛdaya. kāram", "mūrdha ṣi", i.e., the opening at the top of the head is called bright (“jyoti”) because of illumination. "nāsikāgre .yeșu” = i.e., the mind (is fixed) on such objects as the moon, sun, etc. "cittasya "(the modification) of that (mind) without any wavering, in such objects as (the navel-circle, etc.) is called dhāraṇā. "vṛttimātreṇeti”, i.e., it stays without any distraction fixed in the thought of that place alone.

**तत्र प्रत्ययैकतानता ध्यानम् ॥२॥**

 With reference to the same place, when there is a continuous flow of the same knowledge, it is called meditation.

**तस्मिन्देशे ध्येयालम्बनस्य प्रत्ययस्यैकतानता सदृशःप्रवाहः प्रत्ययान्तरेणापरामृष्टो ध्यानम् ॥२॥**

 Meditation is a continuous flow of knowledge which has as its support the object of meditation; i.e., it is a similar flow (of knowledge) untouched by any other knowledge.

तत्र प्रत्ययैकतानता ध्यानम्। तस्मिन् देशे धारणावृत्तिविषये नाभिचक्रादौ। ध्येयालम्बनस्य ध्येयो देशादिः, तदालम्बनस्य। प्रत्ययस्य \[एकतानता\] सदृशप्रवाहः, तुल्यप्रत्ययानां प्रवाह एकाकारः प्रत्ययसन्तानः प्रत्ययान्तरेण विजातीयेन अपरामृष्टः अनाकीर्णः।तत् ध्यानम्॥

 धारणा तु तस्मिन्नेव ध्येये तदवस्थस्यैव चित्तस्य तद्विषयविकल्पितैः प्रत्ययान्तरैः परामृष्टाऽपि।यथा सूर्ये धार्यमाणस्य तद्गतपरिमण्डलतीव्रतरदीधितित्वादिप्रत्ययेष्वपि धारणैव।वृत्तिमात्रेण तत्रैव वर्तमानत्वाच्चित्तस्य। ध्यानं पुनः न तु तथा। भिन्नजातीयप्रत्ययान्तरापरामृष्टैकप्रत्ययप्रवाह एव हि ध्यानम् ॥२॥

* tatra dhyānam.* "tasmin deśe", i.e., in places like the navel-circle, etc., which are the objects of concentration. "dhyeyālambanasya", i.e., places, etc., are to be meditated upon; with reference to such support (of meditation). "pratyayasya. dhyānam" = (meditation) is a series of similar thoughts, a flow of similar thoughts which is untouched by dissimilar (thoughts).

 As for concentration with reference to that same object, the mind in that state is also touched with other alternate thoughts with regard to the same object. For instance, when there is concentration with regard to the sun there is concentration on such thoughts as its circular shape, the intensity of its brightness and so on; this is due to the mind staying on that (object) only through its modification. Meditation on the other hand, is not like that. Meditation is the flow of a single thought which is not touched by another dissimilar thought.

तदेवार्थमात्रनिर्भासं स्वरूपशून्यमिव समाधिः ॥३॥

 When the same 'dhyāna' shines as the object alone ( in the mind) appearing to have lost its reflective nature, it is called 'samādhi'

 तदेव ध्यानं ध्येयाकारनिर्भासं प्रत्ययात्मकेन स्वरूपेण शून्यमिव यदा भवति ध्येयस्वभावावेशात् तदा समाधिरित्युच्यते ॥३॥

 When the same meditation shines only as the object of meditation by becoming the object and appears as if devoid of its reflective nature, then it is known as 'samādhi'

 तदेवार्थमात्रनिर्भासं स्वरूपशून्यमिव समाधिः। तदेव ध्यानं तुल्यप्रत्ययप्रवाहरूपं स्वामेकप्रत्ययसन्तानतामिव हित्वा ध्येयाकारनिर्भासं ध्येयाकारवदवभासते।प्रत्ययात्मकेन स्वेन ग्रहणात्मना स्वरूपेण शून्यमिव।यथा स्फटिकद्रव्यमुपधानावभासं स्वरूपशून्यमिव।यदा भवति ध्येयस्वभावावेशात् कारणात् चित्तस्य, तदा तदेव ध्यानं समाधिरित्युच्यते ॥

 ननु च योगः समाधिरित्यङ्गी पूर्वमुक्तः। इहाङ्गो योगस्य समाधिरित्याख्यायते। कः पुनरत्राङ्गाङ्गिनोर्भेद इति ? उच्यते—योगः समाधिरिति चित्तस्थितिविशेषो विवक्षितः। इह तु प्रत्ययसन्तानस्यैव ध्येयस्वभावावेशात् ध्येयाकारत्वमङ्गमिति विशेषः ॥३॥

*tadeva . samādhiḥ. “tadeva dhyānam .* ityucyate[^1]”l, i.e, giving up, as it were, its series of a single thought in the form of a flow of similar thoughts, it shines with the form of the object of meditation. "pratyayātmakena iva" = it is of the nature of its object (of meditation ). It is like a crystal shining like the object placed near it, giving up its own nature, as it were. "yadā. ucyate" = this is because the mind ( assumes the nature of the object) ( and then) that meditation ( is called samādhi).

[^1]: "Available readings have "

 Objection—But then, it has been already mentioned that yoga is samādhi, the end. Here samādhi is mentioned as the limb (means) of yoga. Then what is the difference between the means and the end here[^2] in the eightfold yoga; it is also mentioned as the end of yoga and equated to yoga; so how does one reconcile this?")?

[^2]: "Samādhi is the last means (limb

 Answer—It is said that the description of yoga as samādhi is with the desire to indicate a special state of the mind. In this context, because of taking on the nature of the object of meditation, the means is the series of thoughts becoming one with the object of meditation; that is the special [point](http://3 "Samādhi is becoming one with the object of meditation and till it is at this stage it is still a means.").

त्रयमेकत्र संयमः ॥४॥

 When these three are with reference to the same object it is called 'saṃyama'

 तदेतद्धारणाध्यानसमाधित्रयमेकत्र संयमः। एकविषयाणि त्रीणि साधनानि संयम इत्युच्यते। तदस्य त्रयस्य तान्त्रिकीं परिभाषा संयम इति ॥४॥

 These three ‘dhāraṇā', 'dhyāna' and 'samādhi' when directed towards the same object, is called as 'saṃyama' The three means having the same object is called as 

1.Available readings have "dhyānameva.. " whereas the Vivaraṇakära has "tadeva dhyānam

‘saṃyama' The technical definition (in yoga) of these three (taken together) is ‘saṃyama'

 तदेतद्धारणाध्यानसमाधित्रयं यद्व्याख्यातं तत् एकत्र एकस्मिन् देशे परिनिष्पन्नं सत् संयम इत्युच्यते तदाह— एकविषयाणि त्रीणि साधनानि संयम इत्युच्यते। तदस्य त्रयस्य इत्थंक्रमेणाभिनिष्पन्नस्य तान्त्रिकी तन्त्रप्रयोजना परिभाषा।जिज्ञासितार्थसाक्षादापादनाय यत्र यत्र संयमः श्रूयते जेतव्यजयाय वा,तत्र तत्र त्रयमेतत् प्रवेदितव्यमित्येवमर्थमेतस्य त्रयस्यास्मिन् शास्त्रे परिभाषेयं संयम इति ॥

वक्ष्यति च– 'परिणामत्रयसंयमादतीतानागतज्ञानम्' 'स्थूलस्वरूपसूक्ष्मान्वयार्थवत्त्वसंयमाद्भूतजयः' इति च॥४॥

 "tadetad saṃyamaḥ”, i.e., (the three[^3]), which have been explained, when realised with reference to one object it is called (saṃyama). He describes it (through the following words) “eka. ucyate[^4]”.‘‘tadasya paribhāsā”, i.e., when it (the three) is realised in this order (the technical definition) is useful in ( achieving) yoga. Whenever one hears (the use of) 'saṃyama' in order to directly bring about the desired object or for the sake of conquering that which is to be conquered, in all such places one has to understand these three (together) — this is the meaning of these three together in this śāstra (yoga[^5]);(saṃyama) is a technical word (in yoga).

[^3]: "dhāranā, dhyāna and samādhi."

[^4]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not explain this at all."

[^5]: "The word 'tantra' is used in the sense of achieving the purpose of yoga."

 He (Patañjali) will later mention pariṇāma jñānam[^6]and also sthula
bhūtajayah[^7].

[^6]: "YS, III.16. ‘When saṃyama is practised on the three mutations there is knowledge of the past and future."

[^7]: "YS, III.44. By practising saṃyama on the gross, the essential nature, the subtle, the inherence and purposefulness, there is mastery over the elements.'"

तज्जयात्प्रज्ञालोकः ॥५॥

 By mastery of that (samyama) the light of insight (comes into being).

 तस्य संयमस्य जयात्समाधिप्रज्ञाया भवत्यालोकः,यथा यथा संयमः स्थिरपदो भवति तथा तथा समाधिप्रज्ञा विशारदीभवति ॥५॥

 By mastering that 'saṃyama' there arises the light of insight of 'samādhi' In proportion to ‘saṃyama' becoming firmer and firmer the insight of 'samādhi' (also) becomes clearer and clearer.

 तज्जयात् प्रज्ञाऽऽलोकः।तस्य संयमस्य जयात् स्थिरत्वापादनात् अभीप्सितार्थाभिव्यञ्जनसमर्थः प्रदीपालोकदेशीयः समाधिप्रज्ञाया भवत्यालोकः।

 यथा यथा संयमः स्थिरपदो भवति,तथा तथा समाधिप्रज्ञा स्थिरपदी भवति।येन समाधिप्रज्ञाऽऽलोकेन व्यवहितविप्रकृष्यदिवस्तुनिर्भासनसमर्थेन योगिनः करतलकलितमिवाभिमतमर्थमवलोकयन्ति ॥५॥

 *tajjayāt lokaḥ.* “tasya. .jayāt" = by gaining steadiness (in saṃyama) (there arises) “samādhi lokah” = (the light of samādhi-insight) which is like the brightness of light, capable of revealing the desired object. “yathā yathā bhavati[^8]'= by

[^8]: "Available readings have ''viśāradībhavati'' whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has ''sthirpadī bhavati''"

this light of samādhi-insight, which has the capacity to illuminate objects which are hidden and distant, the yogīs can see the desired object like something held in the palm of the hand.

तस्य भूमिषु विनियोगः ॥६॥

 Its application is to the various stages (of yoga).

 तस्य संयमस्य जितभूमेर्यानन्तरा भूमिस्तत्र विनियोगः।न ह्यजिताधरभूमिरनन्तरभूमिं विलङ्घ्यप्रान्तभूमिषु संयमं लभते। तदभावाच्च कुतस्तस्य प्रज्ञालोकः ? ईश्वर प्रसादाज्जितोत्तरभूमिकस्य च नाधरभूमिषु परचित्तज्ञानादिषु संयमो युक्तः। कस्मात् ? तदर्थस्यान्यत एवावगतत्वात्। भूमेरस्या इयमनन्तरा भूमिरित्यत्र योग एवोपाध्यायः। कथम् ? एवं ह्युक्तम्—

योगेन योगो ज्ञातव्यो योगो योगात्प्रवर्तते ।  
योऽप्रमत्तस्तु योगेन स योगे रमते चिरम् ॥ इति ॥६॥

 When one stage has been conquered by 'saṃyama' it is applied to the stage which is immediately next to it. If one has not conquered the earlier stage he cannot gain 'saṃyama' with reference to the last stages by skipping over the intermediate stage. And in the absence of that 'saṃyama' from where can he gain the light of insight?

  But for one who has conquered the later stage due to the grace of God, it is not proper to practise 'saṃyama' in the lower stages such as knowledge of the thoughts of other beings. Why is this so? Because he has gained that purpose already through other sources. Yoga alone is the instructor as to the knowledge that this particular stage is the one immediately following that stage. How is this so? It has thus been mentioned 'Yoga is to be known by yoga, yoga leads to yoga, he who is tireless of yoga delights in yoga for long.'

The Vivaraṇakāra gives a word by word explanation of the sūtra.

*tasya yogaḥ. tasya* = of that saṃyama; bhūmiṣu = with reference to external and internal supports of meditation which are to be mentioned, like the three mutations and so on; *viniyogaḥ* = its usage is to be practised (done).[^9]

[^9]: "The Vivaraṇakāra gives a word by word explanation of the sūtra."

 By one who desires the benefit of directly conquering one stage "tasya bhūmaḥ” = when that stage is conquered, i.e., when the yogi achieves saṃyama in the stage on which he practised samyama, then with reference to the conquered stage "anantarā viniyogaḥ" = saṃyama must be practised on the next stage, after conquering the previous stage.

 Thus, when one has to conquer gradually objects like the earth, etc., which are by nature gross having subtlety which is concominant with it,[^10] one has to practise saṃyama on the gross stage (initially) and when that (stage) is conquered then one has to practise saṃyama on the nature of the next stage. One should not practise (saṃyama) in the stages of subtle objects skipping over the nature of the succeeding (stages)[^11].Why is this so? "na hya labhate" (otherwise one cannot attain samyama) in the higher stages[^12].

[^10]: "Every gross object is derived from the relevant subtle object and so is concomitant with it."

[^11]: "What is aimed at is a gradual conquering of the successive stages. Thus according to Miśra, after practising saṃyama on the savitarka stage one should progress to the nirvitarka stage. After that one should go on to the savicāra and nirvicāra stages and so on."

[^12]: "The Vivaraṇakāra just relies on the bhāṣya for the explanation."

 If one practises saṃyama on the higher (nearby) stages without conquering the succeeding stages he will not gain saṃyama. Consequently there will be the defect of its not being obtained. "tadalābhācca[^830]"⁵ by the absence of saṃyama "kutastatra[^831]"

," i.e., in the higher stage which is the object of saṃyama, "prajñālokaḥ" (how can there be the light of insight)? (This is so) because there is the absence of the cause. The light of a lamp cannot burn brightly when there is the absence of the union of oil and the wick. "jitottarabhūmikasya[^13]

[^16]: "Discrimination between the self and the sattva intellect."

, because of the opposition of the lower (inferior) stage of knowledge of another's mind to the later stage of self (realisation). In that context, saṃyama on a higher stage having succeeded, when the thought of another mind becomes the support (for saṃyama) the mind of the yogi will also become one with the confused mind (of the other); therefore it is not proper; because, in that case, the self as the object (of saṃyama) has been gained by discrimination in a different way.

5\. The reading available is "tadabhāvācca" whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has "tadalābhācca"

6\. Available readings have "kutastasya" instead of "kutastatra" In the former the emphasis is on the yogi while in the latter it is on the stage of samyama.

 Some others[^17]explain it as “arthasya tvāt" = by gaining ( saṃyama) on the later stages like the self, etc., there is the attainment (of saṃyama) on objects of the lower stage like thoughts in another's mind. In this case[^18], the statement should have been “adharabhūmisu saṃyamo' narthakaḥ” (saṃyama on the lower stages is useless) and not “na yuktaḥ” (not proper). It looks as if the words “na yuktaḥ” are not right (in that sense).

[^17]: "This seems to be a reference to Miśra."

[^18]: "If one accepts the above explanation."

 "bhūmerasya. bhūmiḥ", i.e., how does one learn (understand) that this particular object is to be conquered next ? He thus answers “tatra[^19] yoga evopādhyāyah” “yogaḥ” = the gaining of samyama in the earlier stage; it is through that alone that the next stage is known. "katham · jñātavyaḥ[^20]'= by gaining saṃyama in the earlier stage through yoga the next object of yoga (saṃyama) is to be understood. And that “yogaḥ” = saṃyama, “yogāt pravartate" = is known distinctly by the gaining of saṃyama in the earlier (stage).

[^19]: "The reading given is “atra” whereas the Vivaranakāra has 'tatra'"

[^20]: "The Vivaraṇakāra repeats verbatim what he said earlier."

 Just as for one who is blind from birth itself desiring to climb a flight of stairs, the knowledge of the next step of the stairs comes (dawns on him) through the knowledge gained by the touch (contact) of the foot on the first step, similarly (the yogī knows the next stage) of yoga through yoga (gained in the earlier stage). Because this is so[^21] being so.") therefore one who realises this "apramattastu ciram[^832]",⁶

 These three — ‘dhāraṇā', 'dhyāna' and 'samādhi' are internal (direct) means when compared to the earlier.

6\. Available readings have "yo' pramattastu yogena sa yoge ramate ciram" whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has "apramattastu yogena yogeṣu ramate."

7\. This does not seem consistent with Śankarācārya's advaita philosophy.

 These three-dhāraṇā', 'dhyāna' and 'samadhi'— are internal means of 'saṃprajñāta samadhi' as compared to the earlier five means beginning with 'yama'

* trayam pūrvebhyaḥ* = the three—dhāraṇā, dhyāna and samādhi (are internal means of) "samprajñātasya" (samprajñāta) yoga. "pūrvebhyaḥ[^22] "¹ The use of the word internal is to indicate that importance has to be attached to these three even if perfection has been attained in the earlier means[^23].

[^22]: "Instead of the order "

[^23]: "yama, niyama, etc."

 Even without gaining perfection in the fivefold means of yama, etc., it is possible to attain yoga by the perfection of the three—dhāraṇā, etc., due to the influence of the latent impressions attained in previous births, similar to the condition of the 'videha' and 'prakṛtilaya' yogīs[^24].No one can attain yoga without the (practice of the) three—dhāraṇā, etc. This is because there is a correspondence in the continuity of the working of the three—dhāraṇā (dhyāna,samādhi[^25]). This is so (also because) yoga has the nature of perfection of the mind[^26].

[^24]: "These are yogis who, because of their yogic practices in previous births, attain to the highest state without going through the prescribed means in the subsequent state. For a detailed understanding of these two states refer to Rukmani, Yogavārttika of Vijñānabhikṣu, vol. I, Samādhipăda, pp. 113–18."

[^25]: "One leading to the other, thus the three have a continuous relationship."

[^26]: "In other words yoga has to do with transforming the nature of the ordinary imperfect mind into one that is perfect. It is thus a psychological transformation and thus is within one's effort."

 When there is the perfection of knowledge and detachment then nothing else, even dhāraṇā, etc., is not necessary[^27]. Thus one hears that yogis like Maṅki[^28]and Piṅgalā[^29] attained everything by (total) detachment itself. Thus in this context these two verses have been mentioned earlier[^30].

[^27]: "Thus there is a heirarchy in the means within themselves but not when there are the superior means like jñāna and vairāgya already discussed in Rukmani, op. cit., pp. 111-13."

[^28]: "It is not clear who is referred to by this name."

[^29]: "Piṅgalā the prostitute who attained salvation by her piety. The story is narrated in the Bhāgavata Purāṇa."

[^30]: "Cf. Vivaraṇa under YS, II.29."

 They also are the external aids of the seedless state (asaṃprajñāta samādhi).

 *"tadapi bījasya*. "tadapi" = this (internal means) of yoga with seed[^31], “bahiraṅgamyogasya[^32]" "kasmāt? tadabhāve.. ", i.e., even when there is an absence of the threefold internal means of (yoga) with seed, yoga, without seed[^33],takes place with reference to the special sattva (intellect) of a yogī (person); therefore it is external (to it).

[^31]: "saṃprajñāta samādhi."

[^32]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add any commentary to this and leaves the bhāṣya to speak for itself. The order of the bhāṣya though, is different in the Vivaraṇa."

[^33]: "asamprajñāta samādhi."

 Some (people) who can see very correctly (clearly) are detached from subliminalimpressions, from their birth itself. In their case, samādhi-without seed comes into being through deep understanding of the continued practice of superior detachment[^34] and that which causes superior detachment[^35]. There is no need for them to observe dhāranā, etc. Thus it is said “uktaḥidamārabhyate[^36]"⁶

 अथ निरोधचित्तक्षणेषु, चलं गुणवृत्तम् इत्ति कीदृशस्तदा निरोधपरिणामः ? —

 The nature of the guṇas is movement; therefore, during the mind's moments of restriction, what kind of change takes place during restraint?

**व्युत्थाननिरोधसंस्कारयोरभिभवप्रादुर्भावौ निरोधक्षणचित्तान्वयो निरोधपरिणामः ॥९॥**

 The disappearance of the subliminal-impression of modification and the emergence of the subliminal-impression of restriction, which is invariably associated with the mind during the moment of restriction, is the change of the mind in the restricted stage.

 व्युत्थानसंस्कारः चित्तधर्मो न स प्रत्ययात्मक इति प्रत्ययनिरोधे न निरुद्धः।निरोधसंस्कारोऽपि चित्तधर्मः। तयोरभिभवप्रादुर्भावौ। व्युत्थानसंस्कारा हीयन्ते निरोधसंस्कारा आधीयन्ते। निरोधक्षणं

6."Introduction to YS, II. 1. The available reading is "uddiṣṭaḥ samāhitacittasya yogaḥ, katham vyutthita- citto'pi yogayuktaḥ syādityetadārabhyate"

चित्तमन्वेति।तदेकस्य चित्तस्य प्रतिक्षणमिदं संस्कारान्यथात्वं निरोधपरिणामः।तदा संस्कारशेषं चित्तमिति निरोधसमाधौ व्याख्यातम् ॥९॥

 The subliminal-impression of modification is a characteristic of the mind; it is not of the nature of an act of cognition, therefore, it is not suppressed when the act of cognition is suppressed. The subliminal-impression of restraint is also a characteristic of the mind. There is disappearance and emergence of these two, i.e., the subliminal-impressions of modifications decrease and the subliminal-impressions of restraint appear; (and) at the time of restraint they are invariably connected with the mind. Thus this change of subliminal-impressions of the same mind at every moment is the change of mind in the stage of restraint. At that time the mind has only the subliminal-impressions— this has been explained in the sūtra on the 'samādhi' of the state of restraint. (I.18)

 अथ निरोधचित्तक्षणेषु निरोधयुक्तं निरुध्यमानं चित्तं येषु क्षणेषु निरुध्यते ते निरोधचित्तक्षणाः तेषु निरोधकाले इत्यर्थः। क्षणेष्विति बहुवचनं अतीतानागतवर्तमानवृत्तित्वप्रदर्शनार्थम्॥

 "atha nirodhacittakṣaṇeṣu" = during the moments that the mind is restrained or is being restrained, those are the moments of restraint (of the mind). During those moments is the meaning of (“nirodhacittakṣaṇeṣu”). The usage of the plural in “kṣaṇeṣu” (moments) is to indicate the past, present and future nature of the modifications (of the mind).

 At the moment of restraint, the mind which accompanies the quality of restraint is restricted. “calam guṇavṛttam" = the mind is composed of the guṇas[^38] (and) the nature of the gunas is movement; therefore the mind which is being restrained from outside modifications is bound to have (some) change. In the case of a mind which is not having any change (and) is immutable like puruṣa, restraint is not proper[^39].Therefore the question is asked “kidṛśah. ṇāmah"= (what kind of change is there at the time of restraint). *vyutthān*a *nirodhapariṇāmah*."vyutthānam[^40]",³

[^38]: "All evolutes are composed of the three günas sattva, rajas and tamas; so is the mind."

[^39]: "It does not make sense for such a person to practise restraint because he has already reached the state of purusa."

[^40]: "The bhāsya has "

i.e, different kinds of activity, movement, which takes the shape of knowledge of the mind; the subliminal-impression of the mind generated by that (is the property of) the possessor of that property (i.e., the mind). (It is not of the nature of cognition)

 तथा निरोधजन्मा संस्कारः अप्रत्ययात्मकः चित्तस्यैव धर्मः।स च व्युत्थानसंस्कारोऽप्रत्ययात्मक इति स प्रत्ययनिरोधे न निरुध्यते। व्युत्थानप्रत्ययनिरोधे नाभिभूतः॥

3\. The bhāṣya has "vyutthānasaṃskāraḥ" which the Vivaraṇakāra is analysing.

 Similarly (the subliminal-impression) generated (by restraint) of the nature of non-cognition is the property of the mind alone. "sa ca . nirudhyate[^41]''¹

[^41]: "The Vivaranakāra has an additional "

(therefore) it is not overpowered when (cognition of activity is restrained).

 By the restraint of cognition there arises subliminal-impression born of restraint. “tayoḥabhibhavaprādurbhāvau" = these two subliminal-impressions of activity and restraint residing in their support, the mind, experience overpowering and emergence[^42].

[^42]: "The two subliminal-impressions mutually interact in this manner."

 Question—Will their emergence and disappearance continue without any limit?

 Answer — No.

 Question—How is that ?

 Answer— “vyutthāna . ādhāyante" = (the subliminal-impressions of activity) attain an incapacity to accomplish their purpose.

 Question— Does overpowering and appearance of the two accompany the mind?

 Answer— The accompaniment of the mind of this overpowering and emergence of the two, results in the change of the mind to (a state of ) restraint[^43].“tat”—that is described as "ekasya nirodhaparināmaḥ", i.e., by the overpowering of the subliminal-impression of activity and the emergence of the subliminal-impression of restraint there is a change in the (nature of) subliminal-impressions. While there is decrease (weakening) of the impressions of activity by connection with the more powerful emergence of (subliminal-impressions of) restraint (there is a change to restraint); thus has it been explained. ( At that time) by restricting (the mind) from external thoughts "saṃskāra vyākhyātam” (it is already said that) virāmapratya. anyaḥ[^44].

[^43]: "Thus the result is restraint by overpowering the impressions of activity gradually."

[^44]: "Cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. I, pp. 111–13."

 Question— What is the result ?

 Answer— As it culminates in restraint, as it results in the absence of thoughts at the end, the change is known as “nirodhapariṇāma” (change into the state of restraint). 

1.'The Vivaraṇakāra has an additional "ca" after "sa" and the reading in the Vivaraṇa is "vyutthānasaṃs- kāro'pratyayatmaka iti na pratyayanirodhe na niruddhyate" which is very different from available readings.

 Even though thoughts are present at the stage of samprajñāta (samādhi) they are not desired, but change of subliminal-impressions is alone desired at every moment[^45] to asamprajñāta is described. The subliminal-impressions of asamprajñāta which is another word for nirodha are desired so that, that becomes the state of the yogi eventually.").Just as in the stage of restraint of the mind, even when samādhi is present, it is not desired[^46].Only the state of restraint is desired. So also in the state of (saṃprajñāta-samādhi) with a support (seed), there is desired only the change in subliminal-impressions-neither thoughts, samādhi nor oneness of mind[^47].

[^45]: "The process of change from samprajñāta (which still has some support

[^46]: "A distinction seems to be drawn between the state in which one is and samadhi as a oneness with the state. The former is what is desired as opposed to the latter."

[^47]: "Thus the transformation of the mind through the subliminal-impressions is the aim even in samprajñāta."

तस्य प्रशान्तवाहिता संस्कारात् ॥१०॥

 Due to the subliminal-impression (of restriction) it (the mind) flows peacefully.

 निरोधसंस्कारपाटवापेक्षा प्रशान्तवाहिता चित्तस्य भवति। तं संस्कारमारभ्य यावत् व्युत्थानधर्मिणा संस्कारेण निरोधधर्मसंस्कारो नाभिभूयत इति ॥१०॥

 The peaceful flow of the mind depends on the proficiency of the subliminal-impressions of restraint. When that subliminal-impression commences,it continues till the subliminal-impressions belonging to the restricted state is overcome by the subliminal-impression belonging to the state of activity.

 तस्य चित्तस्य निरोधपरिणाममनुगच्छतः प्रशान्तवाहिता संस्कारात् । निरोधसंस्कारपाटवापेक्षा निरोधसंस्कारस्य पाटवं द्रढिमा तदपेक्षा प्रशान्तवाहिता प्रसन्नता चित्तस्य भवति ॥

i.e., (beginning with) the subliminal-impression of restraint till such time as the subliminal-impression of restraint is not overpowered by activity, there is this peaceful flow; this is so because of the ascent of the subliminal-impression of restraint.

सर्वार्थतैकाग्रतयोः क्षयोदयौ चित्तस्य समाधिपरिणामः ॥११॥

 When there is weakening of attention to all things and there is the rise of onepointedness, that is the change into the 'samādhi' state of the mind.

 सर्वार्थता चित्तधर्मः। एकाग्रताऽपि चित्तधर्मः। सर्वार्थतायाः क्षयः, तिरोभाव इत्यर्थः। एकाग्रताया। उदयः, अविर्भाव इत्यर्थः। तयोः धर्मित्वेन अनुगतं चित्तम्। तदिदं चित्तं अपायोपजनयोः स्वात्मभूर्तयोर्धर्मयोः अनुगमात् समाधीयते। स चित्तस्य समाधिपरिणामः ॥११॥

 Attention to all things is the characteristic of the mind. The weakening of attention to all things means its disappearance; the rising of one-pointedness means its emergence; the mind is invariably connected with both by having both the characteristics. When this mind, connected with these two characteristics of disappearance and appearance belonging to itself, becomes inclined towards samādhi, then it is the change into ‘samādhi' of the mind.

[^52]: "This is in keeping with the Sānkhya-Yoga doctrine."

[^53]: "Thus these two states are already properties of the mind."

 “tayoḥcittam"; here also one understands the connection from the previous sūtra[^54].Thus the mind which is accompanied continuously by a decline in the attention to all objects of experience and an emergence of one-pointedness, transforms into that, having prominence of samādhi. The connection of the decline of attention

[^54]: "Thus a continuous practice of one-pointedness will insure that state of the mind, just as in the previous sūtra, the continuous practice of restraint insured that state."

2.'Instead of "cittadharmaḥ" the Vivaraṇakāra has "cittasya dharmaḥ"

to all objects and the emergence of one-pointedness with the mind, is the change to the state of samādhi. The importance of samādhi has been explained under the section of one-pointedness as "yastvekāgre pradyodayati[^55]"

[^55]: "Cf. bhāsya under YS, I.1."

 The same has been mentioned as "tadidam[^51] ”,²

i.e., (the mind) not separated from its own nature of disappearance and emergence of those—two characteristics. accompanied by attention to all objects and one-pointedness (becomes inclined towards samādhi). "sa. pariṇāmah”,i.e, due to the importance (superiority) of samādhi
[^57] (there is a change into the state of samādhi).

[^57]: "The one-pointed mind helps towards samadhi; as the subliminal-impressions of samadhi continuously arise the mind itself changes into that state."

तत्र पुनः शान्तोदितौ तुल्यप्रत्ययौ चित्तस्यैकाग्रतापरिणामः ॥१२॥

 Therein, when there is a similarity in the cognitive act of the past and the cognitive act of the present, it is the change of the one-pointed state of the mind.

 समाहितचित्तस्य पूर्वप्रत्ययः शान्तः उत्तरस्तत्सदृश उदितः।समाधिचित्तमुभयोरनुगतं पुनस्तथैवाऽऽसमाधिभ्रेषादिति।स खल्वयं धर्मिणश्चित्तस्यैकाग्रतापरिणामः ॥१२॥

 In the case of the one whose mind is steadied, when the earlier act of cognition subsides it is followed by another act of cognition, which is similar to it. A steadied mind is common to both of them and a similar sequence of the same cognitive act goes on till the 'samādhi' state is disturbed. This is the change of one-pointedness of the mind which has this nature.

* tatra punaḥ* .*pariṇāmaḥ[^58].* (at the time of samādhi = tatra ) "samāhitacittasya” and so on; i.e., (of the mind) whose external modifications have been restrained (the earlier cognition) disappears. "uttarastatsadṛśa", etc., (a similar modification) appears[^59].

[^58]: "Instead of tataḥ in available readings the Vivaraṇa has tatra."

[^59]: "Modification of restraint."

2\. 'Instead of "apāyopajanayoḥ svātmabhūtayoḥ dharmayoḥ" the Vivaraṇa has "apayopajanau svātmabhūtau tayordharmayoḥ" The Vivaraṇakāra does not add much to the bhāṣya explanation.

 "samādhi .. anugatam” = (the samādhi state-the mind accompanies) both the past and present cognitions. "punastathaiva. = as and when the first cognition subsides the next one similar to it comes into being; when that subsides another one again arises, when that disappears, another one again appears[^60] thus “ā samādhi- bhreṣāt" (this goes on) till such time as the state of samadhi is disturbed by a subliminal-impression of activity.

[^60]: "This is so unlike the style of Śaṅkara."

 "sa khalvayam. . pariṇāmaḥ= (the) continuous similar past and present cognitions at every moment is the (change into a state of one-pointedness).

 Therein, beginning with the restriction of external modifications, till such time as there is (only) the remainder of subliminal-impressions of (in) the mind there is the change into the state of restraint.

 Similarly, beginning with restricting the external cognitions (modifications), before the restraint of all cognitions (modifications), as also just after the restriction of all cognitions till such time as there is the absence of the rise of one-pointedness, there is the change into the state of samādhi.

 Similarly, at the time of change into the state of samādhi itself, as there is equally the disappearance and appearance (of samādhi change) it is a change into the state of samādhi. The increasing changes come right after the earlier change—thus the three changes have been explained in order[^61]. If that continues without interruption then it progresses into the state of total restraint of even sabīja-samādhi and results in the state of nirodha with only the subliminal-impressions of samādhi and nirodha in the mind.").

[^61]: "Thus, first comes restriction of external modifications which leads to one-pointedness. If that is not interrupted by any modification of activity it leads to samadhi with seed (saṃprajñāta

 Question—What is the use of explaining again all these changes?

 Answer—The nature of the gunas is (constant) movement; and all that is composed by the gunas has the nature of change; is not steady—therefore, for the sake of cultivation of the feeling of detachment (there is the above explanation). Thus by (the practice of) saṃyama on the threefold change there is the above explanation, in order to gain knowledge of the past and the future.

एतेन भूतेन्द्रियेषु धर्मलक्षणावस्थापरिणामा व्याख्याताः ॥१३॥

 Thus, through this, has been explained the changes of characteristics, of secondary (temporal) qualities and of states in the elements and in the sense-organs.

 एतेन पूर्वोक्तेन चित्तपरिणामेन धर्मलक्षणावस्थारूपेण भूतेन्द्रियेषु धर्मपरिणामो लक्षणपरिणामोऽवस्थापरिणामश्च उक्तो वेदितव्यः।

 By the above description of the changes in the mind with regard to characteristics, secondary qualities and states, it should be understood that the changes of characteristics, changes of secondary (temporal) qualities and changes of states of the elements and the sense-organs has also been mentioned.

 Amongst them the change of characteristics is the disappearance of (the attributes of) activity and emergence of (the attributes of) restriction (in the mind). And the secondary change is restriction having the three secondary qualities or being connected with the phases of being. That same (restriction) having given up the phase which is of the nature of not-as-yet - manifested, without overstepping its nature, passes into the next phase of the nature of present existence. In this state which is its second phase, it is manifested as itself. This state is not completely disassociated from the past and future states.

 Similarly, the activity ( of the mind) has three secondary (temporal) qualities or is connected with the three phases (of being ). Having given up its state of present existence, without overcrossing its nature, its passes into the state of past existence. This is its third phase which is not completely disassociated from its future and present states. Similarly when activity comes into being again, giving up its not-as-yet-manifested nature, it passes into a state of present existence without overstepping its nature. In this state, when it manifests its true form, there is useful activity. This is its second phase. It is not completely disassociated from the future and the past states. Thus both restriction and activity have the three secondary (temporal) qualities.

 तथा अवस्थापरिणामः।निरोधक्षणेषु निरोधसंस्कारा बलवन्तो भवन्ति,दुर्बला व्युत्थानसंस्काराः,इत्येवं (ष) धर्माणामवस्थापरिणामः ॥

 धर्मिणो धर्मैः परिणामो धर्माणां त्र्यध्वनां लक्षणैः परिणामो लक्षणानामपि अवस्थाभिः परिणाम इत्येवं धर्मलक्षणावस्थापरिणामैः अशून्यलक्षणं गुणवृत्तमवतिष्ठते। चलं गुणवृत्तम्।गुणस्वाभाव्यं तु प्रवृत्तिकारणमुक्तं गुणानाम् इति॥

 Similarly (there is ) change of states. During the moments of restriction the subliminal-impressions of restriction become powerful and the subliminal-impressions of activity become weak. This is the change of state of the characteristics. In this context there is a change in the substance (dharmī) due to the characteristics; there is a change in the characteristics having three phases, through the secondary (temporal) qualities; and there is a change in the temporal qualities through the states. In this way, the action of the gunas does not exist even for a moment devoid of the (three) changes of characteristics, of secondary qualities and of states. The action of the guṇas consists in ceaseless activity. The nature of the guņas is said to be the reason for the activity of the guṇas.

 एतेन भूतेन्द्रियेषु धर्मधर्मिभेदात् त्रिविधः परिणामो वेदितव्यः।

 संसर्गादस्य सौक्ष्म्यम्।अतोऽनुपलब्धिः इति।

 By this (argument) the threefold change, due to the division of substance and attribute should be understood with regard to the elements and sense-organs (as well). But, in reality, there is only one change, for the attribute is only the very being of the substance; it is the change of the substance itself which is exhibited through the attribute. Just as a gold vessel when melted and being made into something else acquires a different shape and the gold does not become something different (so also) it is only the attribute which is present in the substance which appears as different in the three phases of past, future and present (existence) whereas there is no difference in the substance itself.

 Another says —the substance is more than the attributes since without exceeding its earlier essential nature (the substance) persists coexisting in the various states such as the earlier and the later and it continues to change though the object itself is change- less. This is not a defect. Why? Because (we) do not accept that ( an object) is immutably eternal. Belonging to the three worlds is denied to objects because permanence is denied to them. Though they disappear (into the past ) they still persist because total annihilation is denied to them. Due to merging (in their cause) they are subtle and because of that they are not seen.

लक्षणपरिणामो धर्मोऽध्वसु वर्तमानोऽतीतः,अतीतलक्षणयुक्तः, अनागतवर्तमानाभ्यां लक्षणाभ्यां अवियुक्तः।तथा वर्तमानः,वर्तमानलक्षणयुक्तः,अतीतानागताभ्यां लक्षणाभ्यां अवियुक्तः।तथा अनागतः, अनागतलक्षणयुक्तः, वर्तमानातीताभ्यां लक्षणाभ्यां अवियुक्तः इति ॥

 यथा पुरुषः एकस्यां स्त्रियां रक्तो न शेषासु विरक्तो भवति इति ॥

 अत्र लक्षणपरिणामे सर्वस्य सर्वलक्षणयोगात् अध्वसङ्करः परैः दोषश्चोद्यत इति ॥

 तस्य परिहारः—धर्माणां धर्मत्वं अप्रसाध्यम्। सति च धर्मत्वे लक्षणभेदोऽपि वाच्यः,न वर्तमानसमय एवास्य। एवं हि न चित्तं रागधर्मकम् । क्रोधकाले रागस्य असमुदाचारात् इति ॥

 The quality which is a temporal change exists in all (three) phases; that which is past is connected with the past temporal quality but it is not unconnected with the future and present temporal qualities. Similarly that which is at present existing is connected with the present temporal quality but it is not unconnected with the past and future temporal qualities. Similarly that which is yet-to-come is connected with the future temporal quality but it is not unconnected with the present and past temporal qualities. For example a man attached to one woman is not disinterested in other (women).

 In this connection, with regard to temporal change, some point out the defect that, since all objects have connection with all temporal qualities (simultaneously) there will be confusion in the different phases. That can be met thus: That the characteristics possess their essential nature, i.e., do exist, requires no proof. When the characteristic exists, one can speak of temporal changes as well, since it does not belong only to the present time. The mind thus would not have the characteristic of attachment (at the time of anger), as attachment is not manifest at the time of anger.

 किं च, त्रयाणां लक्षणानां युगपदेकस्यां वृतौ नास्ति सम्भवः। क्रमेण तु स्वव्यञ्जकाञ्जनस्य भावो भवेत् इति।उक्तं च " रूपातिशयाः वृत्त्यतिशयाश्च विरुध्यन्ते।सामान्यानि तु अतिशयैः सह प्रवर्तन्ते"। तस्मात् असंकरः।यथा रागस्यैव क्वचित् समुदाचार इति न तदानीं अन्यत्राभावः।किं तु, केवलं सामान्येन समन्वागत इति अस्ति तदा तस्य भावः।तथा लक्षणस्य इति॥

 न धर्मी त्र्यध्वा धर्मास्तु त्र्यध्वानः।ते लक्षिताः तां तां अवस्थां प्राप्नुवन्तः अन्यत्वेन प्रतिनिर्दिश्यन्ते अवस्थान्तरतः, न द्रव्यान्तरतः।यथा एका रेखा शतस्थाने शतं, दशस्थाने दश, एका च एकस्थाने।यथा वा एकत्वेऽपि स्त्री, माता चोच्यते दुहिता च स्वसा च इति।

 Moreover, it is not possible to have all the three temporal qualities existing at the same time in one individual. But they can come into being gradually, due to the operation of the causes of manifestation. Thus it has been mentioned that preponderance of forms (knowledge &c.) and preponderance of modifications mutually oppose each other; but the ordinary ones co-exist with the preponderant ones. Therefore, there is no confusion. Just as when attachment is manifested towards one object it does not cease to exist towards other objects, but it is only present in a general sense (and) it is therefore present there, at that time as well. It is so with temporal qualities (also).

 The substance does not possess the three phases; but the characteristics possess the three phases. They are either manifested (as present) or unmanifested (as past and future). Of these the manifested ones, assuming different states, are regarded as different due to difference in states and not due to difference in the substance. This is similar to the figure one which means hundred, when in the place of hundred, ten, when in the place of ten and one, when in the place of unity. Or again it is like the same woman being called a mother and a daughter and a sister (according to the different relationship).

 अवस्थापरिणामे कौटस्थ्यप्रसङ्गदोषः कैश्चित् उक्तः। कथम् ? अध्वानः स्वव्यापारेण व्यवहिताः।यदा धर्मः स्वव्यापारं न करोति तदा अनागतः,यदा करोति तदा वर्तमानः, यदा कृत्वा निवृत्तः तदा अतीतः,इत्येवं धर्मिणां नित्यत्वात् धर्मलक्षणाऽवस्थानां कौटस्थ्यं प्राप्नोति इति परैः दोष उच्यते॥

 नासौ दोषः ? कस्मात्।गुणिनित्यत्वेऽपि गुणानां विमर्दवैचित्र्यात्॥

 यथा संस्थानं आदिमत् धर्ममात्रं शब्दादीनां विनाशि अविनाशिनाम्,एवं लिङ्गं आदिमत् धर्ममात्रं सत्त्वादीनां गुणानां विनाशि अविनाशिनाम्।तस्मिन् विकारसंज्ञा इति॥

 Some say that in accepting change of states there is the defect of accepting immutability (of the substance). Why is this so? Because the phases are determined by the functional activity (of the thing). Thus when a thing does not fulfil its function, it is said not to have come into existence as yet, when it fulfils (its function) then it is in existence, when having fulfilled its activity, it is no more than it is past; in this way, some point out the defect that a substance, its characteristics, its temporal changes and its (various) states attain immutability. This is no defect. Why not ? Because even though the substratum is permanent the qualities undergo a variety of changes due to interactions.

 Just as the coming together (as elements) of indestructible subtle qualities such as sound &c., is only a characteristic (dharmamātra) having a beginning and is destructible, so also ‘mahat' having a beginning and which is destructible is only a character-

istic of the indestructible guṇa 'sattva' &c. That (which takes place) in it (dharma) is called a product (vikāra).

 तत्रोदाहरणम्। मृत् धर्मी पिण्डाकारात् आकारान्तरं उपसम्पद्यमानः धर्मतः परिणमते घटाकार इति।घटाकारोऽनागतं लक्षणं हित्वा वर्तमानं लक्षणं प्रतिपद्यत इति लक्षणतः परिणमते।घटो नवपुराणतां प्रतिक्षणमनुभवन् अवस्थापरिणामं प्रतिपद्यत इति।धर्मिणोऽपि धर्मान्तरं अवस्था,धर्मस्यापि लक्षणान्तरं अवस्था, इत्येक एव द्रव्यपरिणामो भेदेनोपदर्शित इति । एवं पदार्थान्तरेष्वपि योज्यमिति।त एते धर्मलक्षणावस्थापरिणामाः धर्मिस्वरूपमनतिक्रान्ताः इत्येक एव परिणामः सर्वानमून् विशेषान् अभिलवते। अवस्थितस्य द्रव्यस्य पूर्वधर्मनिवृत्तौ धर्मान्तरोत्पत्तिः परिणाम इति ॥१३॥

  Here is an illustration in this connection. The substance clay passes from its shape as a lump of clay into another shape which is a change into the shape of a pot. The shape of the pot, giving up its temporal state of futurity, assumes the temporal state of present existence; thus here is a change as a temporal state. The pot undergoing every moment a change from ‘newness' to 'oldness' passes through change of state.

 The substance also undergoes change of state as another characteristic; the characteristic also undergoes a change of state as temporal state; thus there is only one mutation of the substance which has been indicated differently. The same rule should be applied to other objects as well. These three changes of characteristic, of temporal change and of state, do not overstep the real nature of the substance; therefore, there is only one mutation which includes (within itself) all these other special (changes).

 The coming into being of another characteristic of a substance when the earlier characteristic has ceased to be is 'change'

* etena vyākhyātāh.* “etena. ṇāmena" (by the above-mentioned changes in the mind).

 Question—

Qualified in what way?

 Answer — “dharma rūpeṇa” = in the form of characteristic (quality), second-

ary (temporal) quality and (different) states[^62]."bhūtendriyeṣu”, i.e., in the elements like earth, etc., which are gross, and in the sense-organs like the ear, etc., which do not have (further) evolutionary change[^63]."dharma veditavyaḥ[^64]".Because of the change that takes place due to the mind being unsteady, the change of (in) the elements and sense-organs is similar to the change in the mind of the three types of yogīs[^65]— since this is not known instruction is given (here).

[^62]: "The changes in the mind cannot apply to the elements and sense-organs-hence the question."

[^63]: "These are the last in the chain of evolutes."

[^64]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not explain this and leaves the bhāṣya to explain itself."

[^65]: "ekāgratā samādhi and nirodha."

 Objection—But then, the change of the mind into one-pointedness, samādhi and restraint have been mentioned, but not the changes into qualities, secondary qualities and states. Where is the instruction regarding that? He indicates their instruction as follows:

  Answer– “tatra vyutthāna. " and so on, i.e., (the change in quality is the disappearance and appearance) of the qualities (of activity and restraint) in “dharmiṇi" = the mind. By this mention of different qualities the change in qualities has been mentioned. By the mention of the disappearance and appearance of (modifications of) activity and restraint of the change in qualities,the change in secondary characteristics has been mentioned.

 Question—

How is that?

 Answer—

That characteristic which attains the past-state from the present state is overpowered (i.e., it disappears ). And that which attains the present state from the not-yet-manifest state that is emergence (appearance). By the mention of disappearance and appearance at every moment the secondary change which is weak by nature has been mentioned (through the words) "lakṣaṇa ." and so on.[^66]

[^66]: "The available reading is lakṣaṇapariṇāmaśca” whereas the Vivaranakāra has lakṣaṇapariṇāmo"

 The secondary change in the mind, having three distinctive marks "tribhi. yuktaḥ” = is manifested as not as yet - manifest, as present and as past. The single changeful mind has the three phases (temporal states) of being; these (three) are necessarily existent. That which does not have these (three ) is the changeless, immutable (one).

"sa khalu[^834]"¹ and so on. That restraint ( does not give up its nature ) as there is absence of something that does not exist coming into being[^67]. In the event of a non-existing thing coming into existence one cannot understand a single substance having the three temporal states of being; something divided (separately) into three temporal states of being cannot be said to have three secondary qualities. Thus he says—"dharmatvam and so on, i.e., the (manifestation) of restraint in the secondary state of present existence is with reference to the phase of not-as-yet-manifest, its second phase. When activity gains its secondary quality of present existence, then restraint attains the third secondary quality of past existence.

[^67]: "Sankhya-Yoga believes in satkāryavāda and thus cannot countenance something not in existence coming into being like in the system of Nyāya."

[^834]: # "The available reading is "

 Question—Let it be so. But when restraint gains the secondary quality of present existence it does not have the three phases[^68]. Therefore he says-answers— “nātīta and so on, (it does not give up its past and not-as-yet-manifest natures).

[^68]: "At the moment of present existence it does not have the three qualities."

 Question — How is that? 

 Answer—Because that itself is not-as-yet-manifest, present and past as well.

 "tathā. pratipannam"—thus (activity connected with the three phases of) past, not-as-yet-manifest and present, (giving up its present phase without overstepping its nature), as explained with reference to restraint, (gains) the (past) temporal phase when the quality of restraint gains the temporal phase of the present.

 “eṣo’sya dvitïyo'dhvā”[^69],⁴ i.e., keeping in mind the present first temporal phase of activity it is (its second temporal phase). When there is succession to the second then the third temporal phase becomes the second[^70]."na cānāgata viyuktam”[^71]

[^69]: "The available readings have "

[^70]: "The not-as-yet-manifest will become the second."

[^71]: "The Vivaraṇakāra leaves the line to speak for itself."

1\. The available reading is "sa khalu anāgatalakṣaṇamadhvānam prathamam hitvā" whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has no "prathamam" in his reading.

4\. "The available readings have " tritīyo'dhvā" instead of " dvitiyo'dhvā" in the Vivaraṇa. The other commentators like Miśra and Bhiksu tend to take the first phase as the not-as-yet-manifest stage, the second as the present stage and the third as the past stage. Thus the past stage is mentioned as the third. The Vivaraṇakāra seems to emphasise the state of restraint and the state of activity and thus view the past state with reference to the activity as the second stage. Thus depending on the focus, the stage can either be the third or the second as it does not change the meaning in anyway.

punarvyutthānam. and so on[^72];i.e., ( again activity) (when succeeding) the subliminal-impression of restraint, it (gives up its not-as-yet-manifest) temporal phase (and obtains the secondary quality of present existence[^73]...)."yatrāsya. vyāpāraḥ”, i.e., there is the capacity to bring about one's effect (activity) "eşo'sya adhvā)" = with reference to the not-as-yet-manifest phase; ( this is its second temporal phase). "na cā.. viyuktam".[^74]

[^72]: "Available readings have “evam punarvyutthānam."

[^73]: "There is nothing new added to the bhāṣya explanation."

[^74]: "Nothing new is added to the bhāṣya explanation."

Thus the mind is not connected to the characteristics of activity and restraint (at the same time). "evam punar iti" = this is the secondary change of the qualities of the mind which are (modifications in the form of) activity and restraint[^75]. "tathā avasthāpariṇāmaḥ" (in a similar way the change of states) is seen.

[^75]: "Qualities of the mind are modifications of activity and restraint. Their three temporal phases are the secondary qualities."

 Question—How is that ( seen )?

 Answer — “nirodha bhavati[^76]”⁵

[^76]: "There is an additional "

—when restraint is present (the subliminal-impressions of restraint) are powerful; i.e., due to the power of the subliminal-impressions the restraint also has power. “durbalā rāh" = and because of that there is weakening of activity. Similarly when the secondary quality of activity (is present) the subliminal-impressions of activity are more powerful (and) there is weakening of the subliminal-impressions of restraint; “ityevam. parināmaḥ" = (in this manner) at every moment by connection with the states of being powerful and being weak, (there is the change of states of the characteristics).

 In that context he indicates to whom the change happens (and) in what form (through the words) "dharmiṇo . nāmaḥ”[^77].Thus (there is change of) the mind, the substance (dharmi) through the qualities of restraint and activity. “dharmāṇām pariṇāmaḥ” = there is change of the qualities of the mind such as restraint, etc., through the sec- ondary qualities like not-as-yet-manifest, etc. "lakṣa pariṇāmaḥ" = and the secondary qualities like the present, etc., have change through states like possessing 

[^77]: "Here also there is an additional “tatra” before “dharmiṇaḥ” in available readings."

5\. There is an additional "tatra" before "nirodhakṣaṇeṣu" in available readings.

power, etc. “ityevam avatiṣṭhate”[^78] (these qualities exist without break in the mind). “calam guṇavṛttam[^79]”,i.e., this “tu guṇasvā guṇānām[^80]” (nature of the gunas) is ( mentioned as) the cause for all activity of the ( guṇas) — sattva, etc. “etena veditavyaḥ” = due to this well-known threefold change into quality, secondary quality and (different) state in the mind (one should understand the threefold change in the elements and the sense-organs due to the division of substance and attribute).[^81]

[^78]: "The available readings have “parināmaiḥśunyam na kṣaṇamapi guṇavrttamavatiṣṭhate"

[^80]: "The “tu” comes after "

[^81]: "This is a repetition of what the bhāṣya says."

 "paramārtha. nāmaḥ” (in truth there is only one change).

 Question—How is that?

 Answer— “dharmi . dharmaḥ”, i.e., there is no quality which is different after giving up the substance. Nor is there something considered different as secondary quality by abandoning (the primary) quality. Nor can the states be different from the secondary quality. Therefore, "dharmi. pañcyate", i.e., by difference in quality (it is described) as threefold.

 Question— How is this only a change of the substance? Is there not a coming into being and disappearance of something new? In that context he says—

 Answer— "tatra. . eva",[^82] i.e., the quality like a pot, etc., existing in the substance called clay, appears as different (at different times like the past, not-as-yet-manifest and the present); thus (the pot) has gone out of existence, (the pot) exists and (the pot) has not come into being are (all thoughts ) while existing in the substance. The difference is only the appearance and disappearance of the quality; “na dravyānyathātvam”,[^83]i.e., that same qualified substance clay takes on another form.

[^82]: "The Vivaraṇakāra places the "

[^83]: "There is an additional “tu"

 He gives an illustration (through the words) "yathāsuvarṇa " and so on; i.e., (solid gold made into) the shape of earrings, etc., has a different arrangement like svastika, circular shape, etc. (but the substance gold is not different).

1\. 'The available readings have "... pariṇāmaiḥ śūnyam na kṣaṇamapi guṇavṛttamavatiṣṭhate" whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has " parināmaiḥ aśūnyalakṣaṇam gunavṛttamavatiṣṭhate" The Vivaraṇakara does not add anything new to the bhāṣya.  
2. There is a "ca" after "calam" in available readings.  
3. The "tu" comes after "guṇasvābhavyam" in the bhāṣya reading.  
4. This is a repetition of what the bhāṣya says.  
5. The Vivaraṇakāra places the "eva" at the end and not after "vartamanasya" as found in bhāṣya readings.  
6. There is an additional "tu" after "na" in available readings.

(The other)[^84]¹who believes in the coming into existence of something new (says)— "dharmā. "[^85],²i.e., (the substance) is different from the qualities. Another and another non-existent quality keeps coming up. Thus with reference to properties such as the past, future and present, one substance cannot be the substratum not different from the qualities. "yadyanvayī." and so on;[^86]³(the substratum) without exceeding the qualities, not different from the qualities "pūrvatattvāt" (not exceeding) its earlier and earlier nature of the substance, accompanies the different states such as the past, etc. The following defect then will be attached to it—

 He replies (as follows)-"ayam... gamāt"[^88]⁵ (this is no defect-why) i.e., the substance which is absolutely immutable or having absolute destruction is not acceptable. If the substance is absolutely immutable like the ātman (self) then, since the qualities are non-different from such a substance, immutability will be affected—

[^88]: "No translation is given as there is nothing new added to the bhāṣya. Instead of “ekāntatā'- nabhyupagamāt"

thus it will be a defected[^89]. It is not reasonable to have the characterised guṇas having absolute immutability[^90].He will mention (later) that the gunas have a changeful—

[^89]: "Immutability of the ātman will be affected."

[^90]: "As all substances are made up of the three guṇas the substances can be spoken of as the guņas also."

eternal nature[^91] is eternal in the system.").

[^91]: "As prakṛti (composed of the three guņas

 Or absolute difference or non-difference between the substance and its attributes is not logical. If there is absolute non-difference between the qualities and the accompanying qualified (substances) then they will attain immutability. If there is absolute difference, then the qualities will be totally destroyed.

 Neither can both absolute difference and non-difference be accepted. Therefore, there is no defect of immutability.

1\. The Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika school, mainly, amongst the āstika schools. Both Miśra and Bhikṣu take "apara" to refer to the Buddhist.  
2. The available reading is "dharmānabhyadhiko dharmī" Instead the Vivaraṇakāra has "dharmā- bhyadhiko dharmī"  
3. The Vivaraṇakāra changes the order of the bhāṣya while explaining it. Available readings have pūrvatattvānatikramāt, pūrvāparāvasthābhedamanupatitaḥ kauṭasthyenaiva parivarteta yadyanvayi syāditi" whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has "...pūrvatattvāt anatikrāman pūrvāparāvasthābhedamanupatitaḥ kauṭasthyenāpi parivarteta...".  
4. "The word "varteta" probably is a mistake and has been taken to be 'parivarteta' in translation.

5\. "No translation is given as there is nothing new added to the bhāṣya. Instead of "ekāntatā'- nabhyupagamāt" the Vivaraṇakāra has "ekantānabhyupagamāt"

 Question– How is there absence of immutability ( in the qualities ) ?

 Answer – (Is given through the words) “tadetat . ." and so on[^92];(existing in three worlds, eternality is denied to objects); there is no immutable (existence). Why is that? “nityatva . " because being an effect, eternality is denied (to the object). Then if it is said that it is destroyed completely, then the answer is—"apetam .dhāt",i.e., since the cause
[^93]is eternal and since the effect is non-different (from it) total destruction is denied.

[^92]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not explain the line but leaves the bhāṣya to speak for itself."

[^93]: "The cause in Sankhya-Yoga being pradhana or prakṛti which is eternal."

 Then some say that this is an illustration of the fallacy called contradictory middle term[^94] is fallacious. They are anaikāntika, viruddha, asiddha, satpratipakṣa, and bādhita."). How is that? Thus 'This change of the object is denied, as eternity is denied, it also persists though lost, as destruction is denied'; in this reasoning the middle term is ' as eternity is denied; this contradicts the conclusion 'though lost it exists in change’[^95]

[^94]: "Nyāya mentions five instances where the middle term (hetu

[^95]: "How can it exist in change if eternality is denied to it; thus it contradicts the middle term and is therefore a fallacy of the 'viruddha' kind."

 How is that? An individual object is a production (origin) of itself, disappearance is a loss, if by gaining one's origin there is change which is a loss, then the denial of eternity does not stand to reason.[^96]As even the lost individual object has change (by coming into being again) that is indeed being eternal[^97].

[^96]: "The change into self-realisation is the appearance of something lost earlier. Thus as it persists, there is no denial of eternality."

[^97]: "But the same individual cannot come into being only another of its nature—but the Sânkhya-Yoga school does not enter that controversy."

 The denial of permanence is the loss of the change from actualising itself. That which does not actualise itself that is non-eternality. That whch exists does not stop from actualising itself. Existence and loss of self-actualisation are two contradictory qualities and do not co-exist. That middle term which operates depending on a principle, is a contradictory middle term when it destroys that same principle.

 Answer—This is not a defect, as substances are observed to have both the properties of manifestation and non-manifestation. Just as, for instance, when a pot, etc., though existing, are not found inside a room; nor is it possible to know that it does not exist at the time because it is only revealed through a lamp. Similarly this triple world connected within its cause is existent, having the nature of non-manifestation of the gunas; (and) it reveals itself due the efficient cause of the purpose of serving the goal of puruṣa.

 Similarly when there is cessation of the latent impression of activity on the manifestation of the latent impression of steadiness, there is disappearance of the manifestation of change with regard to the cause[^98]. Just as, when the light of a lamp though present is hidden, (objects like) a pot, etc., though existent, being covered by darkness, are out of reach to the individual. Similarly, here also substances (qualities) like mahat, etc., having the three temporal phases have the nature of appearing and disappearing; but that is not so of the ( gunas) sattva, etc., which are their supports[^99].

[^98]: "As there is no activity at this stage."

[^99]: "These being the substratum or support as the constituents of prakṛti."

 Thus the triple world[^100]of mahat, etc., up to a lump of grass which are the properties of sattva, etc., having the nature of non-manifestation being a collection of subtle properties that are totally restrained, are not grasped in the form of manifested gross properties[^101]. Thus he (Vyāsa) says "tadetad ... paiti", i.e., there is no disappearance in the form of the substance. Thus as it is eternal in the form of the qualified substance he (Vyāsa) says—"tadapeta.

[^100]: "As they all are composed of the threefold guņas."

[^101]: "Only individual objects which are properties of sattva, etc. are perceived and not sattva, etc."

तदेवं व्यक्तिरूपश्च शक्तिरूपश्चैको धर्मी, व्यक्तिरूपेण च तस्यानित्यत्वं, शक्तिरूपेण च नित्यत्वमिति कथमेष विरोधः स्यात्। न हि देवदत्तश्चलनादिव्यापारेण सर्वदा गृह्यमाणश्चलनादिविरामे विरंस्यति। चलनमेव हि तिरोधीयते। तस्मादव्यक्तावस्थायामप्यस्ति धर्मी, व्यक्तावस्थायामुपलभ्यमानत्वात्, अन्धतमसावस्थित घटादिवत् ॥

 व्यक्तिरपि स्वकीयधर्मान्तरसमीक्षया धर्मिणी। सा च धर्मिरूपेण नित्या,धर्मरूपेणानित्या अभ्युपेयते।एवं विकारेषु धर्मधर्मिभेदोऽनवस्थित इत्यनवस्थाऽपि इष्यत एव॥

 तत्र व्यक्तेरपैति इत्यनेन न विरुध्यते, नित्यत्वप्रतिषेधात् इत्ययं हेतुः। नापि अपतेमप्यस्ति इत्यनेन विरोधः। उभयोर्भिन्नविषयत्वात्। नापि विनाशप्रतिषेधात् इत्ययं अपेतमप्यस्ति इत्यनेन विरुध्यते।यथा बाह्यादपेतोऽप्यस्ति देवदत्त इति॥

 अथ मन्वीथाः—अस्ति इति नित्यत्वमुच्यते,तेन नित्यत्वप्रतिषेधात् इत्ययं नित्यत्वेन विरोधमालिङ्गतीति। न— अनभ्युपगमात्। न हि व्यक्तेर्नित्यत्वमभ्युपगच्छेम, तस्या एव नित्यत्वं प्रतिषेधेम। शक्तिव्यक्तिधर्मकत्वाभ्युपगमादिति हि प्रतिपादितम् ॥

 Thus in this way, the single qualified substance has both a manifest form and a potential form; in the manifest form it is non-eternal and in the potential form it is 

eternal.So how can there be any contradiction? Devadatta for instance, seen everywhere by his activities of walking, etc., does not vanish when he stops walking. It is only walking that disappears. Therefore the substance exists even in the state of non- manifestation as it is perceived in the state of manifestation like the pot that exists in deep darkness.

 The manifest thing is also a qualified thing with reference to its other inherent properties. That is also eternal in the form of the substance; in the form of the property it is non-eternal. Thus the difference as the quality and the qualified in the changes (modifications) is not fixed and this non-fixity is also desired.

 In that context the statement "vyakterapaiti" is not a contradiction as the reason (mark) is "rātyatvapratiṣedhāt". Nor is there a contradiction in "apetamapyasti" since the two have different objects of reference. Nor is the statement "vināśapratiṣedhāt" in contradiction to "apetamapyasti"[^102]. This is similar to Devadatta living though disappearing outwardly.

[^102]: "All these have been already translated in the bhāṣya and so are not repeated."

 Question—

You may think—

"asti” (exists) implies permanence; therefore "nityatvapratiṣedhät" = this (phrase) contradicts permanence.

 Answer—

That is not so; because it is not perceived as such. We do not accept the permanence of the manifested object, we deny its permanence; it is already indicated that we accept (both) potential and actual properties.

 If there is uncertainty regarding this then another example desired by another is given which is that of the example of the blind man and the mirror. A blind man, paying attention to his incapacity to see, acquires a mirror for his own use this also appears to be like that.

 Moreover, even if in one locus itself, you desire to state that there is a superimposition of permanence and impermanence in its actuality and potentiality respectively, even then there cannot be a contradictory example, since it is not possible to establish its opposite.How is that so? apeto'pyasti nityatvapratiṣedhāt[^103]" (though vanished it exists, as permanence is denied), "nitya. . dhāt" means impermanence. “apetasyā . tvam" (the existence of that which has vanished) means its permanence. The opposite of permanence is non-permanence. Nor can non-permanence of one part have non-permanence as its mark for trying to prove the opposite as it will contradict permanence.Not proving what is not desired it will bring about a contradiction[^104].

 Question — Moreover, the denial of permanence is only a disappearance of one's own being you should say.

 Answer—Even so, it is only a difference in word-usage and not a difference in meaning. Disappearance of one's own being (and) impermanence means the same.

 Question—As there is no possibility of permanence, can be used.

 Answer—Even so, the word “nityatvapratisedhāt" denotes the meaning of having no possibility for permanence.

 Question—Even so, he questions the denotation through superimposition ( to which) he replies—Even so, the answer is given that when there is distinction as potential substance and actual quality then there is no permanence and impermanence (together).

 In this manner the idea of contradiction is rejected through the phrase "apeto'pyasti, vināśapratiṣedhāt[^105]".

[^105]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has “apeto'pyasti ... instead of "

 Question—In such a state when the individual manifestation has vanished and it is not perceived directly, how is it permanent. Then it is not existent as it is not perceived like (the) sky-flower.

 Answer —Non-perception is an unproved mark, as it is perceived through inference and through scripture (word). That which is manifest, exists even before its manifestation, from which it comes into existence. If it does not exist then it cannot come into existence like the hare's horn.

 Moreover, if the non-existent exists and the existent does not exist thenthere will be confusion everywhere.

 Moreover, if that which is not perceived does not exist then the causes for the liberation of the selves could not exist later before they are earlier perceived; so how can it be attained by anyone[^106] ? Thus:-

[^106]: "But liberation is attained according to the belief."

 That which is non-existent has no existence and there is no non-existence for that which exists[^107]''—thus says tradition, scripture. Not having direct perception ( of an object) is not the cause for non-existence.[^108]

[^107]: "Bha. Gītā, II.16."

[^108]: "It does not lead to the conclusion that it does not exist."

 Question—

But if the individual object alone has change how is it not seen?

 Answer —“saṃsargād[^1]."³

i.e., as it is directly (merged) in its cause (it is subtle[^110]);so it is not seen and not because it does not exist.

[^110]: "Not directly perceived."

 Now he indicates the change of state of the elements and sense-organs (through the words) “lakṣaṇapariṇāmo..." and so on; i.e., just as a pot etc., from clay (having) a past (temporal quality ) ( has the quality of past existence).

 Question—

What is being said ?

 Answer—

"atīta . . ." (though past) it does not attain non-existence. It is (not unconnected) with the “anāgata.." = other two states[^111], as it exists in its cause, the clay; though the pot connected with it (clay) does not exist (as a pot) the pot is connected with the secondary quality of present existence. Similarly, the future (not-as-yet- manifest) pot exists as not-as-yet-manifest-clay and as a future occurrence is not separated from the secondary quality of not-as-yet-manifest. “tathā vartamānah aviyuktaḥ[^1]",⁶

[^111]: "Present and future."

i.e., as the past and future secondary qualities are of the nature of clay so, even if the pot is hidden (from view when in the past and future stages) it is not separated from the secondary quality of past existence.

 Question—

How is it that a quality connected with one secondary quality is not separated from two other secondary qualities?

 Answer—He gives an example of non-separation (through the words) “yathā puruṣah bhavati", i.e., attachment is connected with the others, i.e., the past and future secondary qualities. That which exists cannot be destroyed and that which has no existence has no coming into being-this has been already indicated.

3.Available readings have "saṃsargāccāsya"-the Vivaraṇa has no "ca" after "saṃsargāt" So also instead of "saukṣmyāccānupalabdhiḥ" the Vivarana has "ato'nupalabdhiḥ"

6\. Available readings have "tathānāgata...aviyuktaḥ" before "tathā vartamāno... aviyuktaḥ". The Vivaraṇa reading has "tathā vartamāno..." first. The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything new to the bhāṣya explanation.

 "atra. codyate[^113]”'¹

[^113]: "Available readings have samkaraḥ prāpnotīti. . codyate"

(as the quality is connected with all secondary temporal qualities there will be confusion say some). How is that? That which is to come in the future exists now and is also past. By that logic that which is past has both the present and future (qualities); and that which exists now has the past and future ( qualities) and the future (object ) has the past and present (qualities) — in this way there is confusion mutually amongst the temporal qualities.

 “tasya parihāraḥ” (the remedy) is mentioned as follows—“dharmāṇām vācyaḥ",i.e., the substance called clay having different properties like a lump, a pot, potsherd, etc., distinguished from other properties (needs no proof). (When there are the properties) and they are different (one can say that secondary qualities) are also proven.

 How is that? As a pot in the state of a lump (of clay) connected with the secondary quality of not-as-yet-manifest is neither existent (now ) nor is it past. Even though with reference to the state of clay and the future state, the past and present states are also not unconnected[^114].

[^114]: "A present pot could have become the lump of clay—thus the present and past are not unconnected with it."

 Similarly that connected with the secondary quality of present existence is neither past nor not-as-yet-manifest; even though when one views it as a substance it is separated from the secondary qualities of disappearance and appearance which are the qualities of the past and future existences[^115].

[^115]: "With reference to the concrete substance in existence these two are not perceived."

 Similarly that which is past, connected with the secondary quality of the past, is neither existent nor not-as-yet-manifest; even though with reference to the individual object experienced as clay it is not unconnected with the not-as-yet-manifest and the present (qualities)[^116].

[^116]: "This whole discussion is so unlike the style of Śaṅkara."

 Similarly one should understand this with reference to the lump of clay, the potsherd and so on.

 Therefore, he says — “na vartamāna[^117]..."¹

[^117]: "The reading available is "

and so on; i.e., it does not have only one secondary quality. Then how is it? It has the three secondary qualities in the manner described (above). Therefore, there is no confusion in the temporal qualities. "evam hi. kam"[^118],²

[^118]: "Available readings have a “syāt"

ie, in the mind which is devoid of attachment, when there is present the quality of attachment, etc., and because they are proved to be different, there is no confusion in their paths[^119]. Why is this so? "krodha . . . rāt", i.e., when anger is present, attachment does not arise as it does in its own time. Or, during the time of anger attachment is either past or is yet to come. Similar is the case with anger at the time of attachment. If there were only one secondary quality called 'the present' then even at the time of anger, attachment would arise; or it may not arise; nor would it not be present at the time of anger.

[^119]: "i.e., one does not exist with the other together in the mind—if it did that would lead to confusion."

 "kiṃca[^120] "⁴

[^120]: "In available readings there is an additional "

and so on; (as the modifications) of the secondary qualities contradict each other (they cannot arise simultaneously). “krameṇa" = the secondary qualities arise in order "svavyañjakāñjanasya" = when the cause for its manifestation like a pot, etc., (give rise) to one or the other secondary quality[^121].

[^121]: "When the pot has a future, present or past existence that becomes the cause for the manifestation of the respective secondary quality."

4\. In available readings there is an additional "vyaktau" after "ekasyām"

fication) in the form of a lump of clay, that does not take place[^122].Therefore the past and the future, underlying generally the substance, due to non-opposition "atiśayaiḥ exists (along with the preponderant modifications). "tasmāt. (therefore, there is no confusion) in the temporal phases. "yathā. " and so on, i.e., attachment (is not absent) with reference to other women[^123]."kintu[^76] "³

[^125]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not explain this but leaves it to speak for itself."

 Objection—

But then, since the lump of clay and the potsherd being past and not- as-yet come, and since they are absent in the state of the (present) pot, their substance known as clay must have the qualities of past and future qualities; therefore, as there is the absence in the clay of both the lump of clay and the potsherd, the qualities like the lump of clay and the potsherd cannot reasonably have the three temporal (secondary) qualities; having this doubt he gives the answer (through the following words)—

"na dharmī tryadhvā", i.e., the substance called clay is neither past nor as-yet-to-be- manifest through the past and future lump of clay or potsherd; this is because in all qualities there is the recognition of the underlying clay. How is it then? "dharmaḥ naḥ" = the properties like a lump of clay, etc., (have all three times); at the time of (the presence of) the pot one does not perceive the lump of clay or potsherd. So one should not doubt the connection of the qualities[^126] with the three phases of time.

[^126]: "Everything like a lump of clay, potsherd, pot, jug, etc., are properties of the substance clay."

"yathā. " and so no; i.e., (just as the figure one) in the third place with two zeros becomes (a hundred). That same figure one with one zero in the second place (denotes a ten). And in the (first place it denotes one[^51]).⁷

just as the same woman (is called a mother, a daughter) and a sister according to the different relationship, similarly due to different states there is a difference in names and concepts; it is not due to a difference in the substance and the property. Therefore the view of others that the cause for the difference in cause

There is no defect (in the belief). (How is that?)

 “tatrodāharaṇam. pariṇamate[^1]”,² i.e, the lump of clay (getting the shape of) a pot (changes into a pot); "ghaṭākāro parinamate" Similarly “ghaṭo iti”.[^135]“dharmiṇo ", i.e., the state of a lump of clay, etc., is another quality of clay, etc., the substance (clay) was in the state of a lump of clay, potsherd, etc.[^136]So also the quality of not-as-yet-manifest, etc., (is the secondary quality) of the pot, etc. that same quality pot gets the states of past, not-as-yet-manifest and present existences.

[^135]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not explain these lines at all."

[^136]: "Before the pot came into existence."

 "tata " and so on (there is only one change); this principle is (to be applied) in other changes like the body, sense-organs, etc., "ta ete abhiplavate[^137]"= (there is only one change) of the substance; ( it underlies) all the changes of quality, secondary quality and states.

[^137]: "The Vivaraṇakāra hardly adds anything to the bhāṣya."

 How does that happen? As "avasthitasya. iti[^138]" (a new characteristic comes into being when the earlier characteristic ceases) it is possible to understand that the substance itself is change.

[^138]: "Available readings have “atha ko'yam pariṇāmaḥ? avasthitasya ."

 तत्र—

 Of these:

शान्तोदिताव्यपदेश्यधर्मानुपाती धर्मी ॥१४॥

 A substance (characterised object) is that which continues to exist in the past, the present ( rising) and the future (unnameable) characteristics.

 योग्यतावच्छिन्ना धर्मिणः शक्तिरेव धर्मः। स च फलप्रसवभेदानुमितसद्भावः एकस्य अन्यश्चान्यश्च।दृष्टः तत्र वर्तमानः स्वं व्यापारं अनुभवन् धर्मी धर्मान्तरेभ्यः शान्तेभ्यश्च अव्यपदेश्येभ्यश्च भिद्यते।यदा तु सामान्येन समन्वागतो भवति, तदा धर्मिस्वरूपमात्रत्वात् कोऽसौ केन भिद्येत ॥

2.Available readings have "tatredamudāharaṇam"

 ते खलु धर्मिणो धर्माः शान्ताः ये कृत्वा व्यापारम् उपरताः। सव्यापाराः उदिताः। ते च अनागतलक्षणस्य समनन्तराः। वर्तमानस्य अनन्तरा अतीताः। किमर्थं अतीतस्य अनन्तरा न भवन्ति वर्तमानाः ? पूर्वपश्चिमाभावात्।

 यथा अनागतवर्तमानयोः पूर्वपश्चिमता, नैवं अतीतस्य। तस्मात् नातीतस्यास्ति समनन्तरः। तदनागत एव समनन्तरो भवति वर्तमानस्य इति ॥

 अथ अव्यपदेश्याः के ?

 सर्वं सर्वात्मकम् इति। तत्रोक्तम्—जलभूम्योः पारिणामिकं रसादिवैश्वरूप्यं स्थावरेषु दृष्टम्।तथा स्थावराणां जङ्गमेषु, जङ्गमानां स्थावरेषु इत्येवं जात्यनुच्छेदेन सर्व सर्वात्मकम् इति॥

 A characteristic is only the (inherent) power of an object conditioned by its capacity. Its existence is inferred by the rise of different results; (thus) of one which is of one sort there is another result and a different form; is also seen. Of these, it is seen that the present substance is that which is going through its operation and it is different from the other characteristics, i.e., the past and the future. But when it becomes latent in its generic form then, by being the very nature of the substance itself, what is this (characteristic) and by what is it distinguished?

 Those characteristics of an object are past. They are those which have been in operation and then ceased to be. The present are those in operation—they come immediately adjoining the temporal state of the 'not-as-yet-manifested' The past (temporal states) come immediately adjoining the present. Why is it that the present (temporal states) do not come immediately, adjoining the past (states) ? Because of the absence of the relationship of before and after (between them). Just as the future and present temporal states have the relationship of before and after, it is not so with the past (and present states). Therefore the past (state) is not immediately adjoining (the present ). Therefore it ( the present state ) does not come immediately adjoining the past ( state). Thus only the 'not-as-yet-manifested' ( state ) is immediately adjoining the present (state).

 Now what are the future (unnameable ) states ? Everything is essentially everything. Thus it has been said in this connection—The infinite variety of all forms of taste &c., due to the change of water and earth is seen in immovable objects (plants &c.). Similarly ( what is found) in immovable things (plants ) is found in movable things and (what is found) in movable things is found in immovable objects. In this way, because of non-destructibility of the common nature everything is everything else.

 देशकालाकारनिमित्तापबन्धात् न खलु समानकालम् आत्मनाम् अभिव्यक्तिः इति। य एतेषु अभिव्यक्तानभिव्यक्तेषु धर्मेषु अनुपाती सामान्यविशेषात्मा सोऽन्वयी धर्मी। यस्य तु धर्ममात्रमेवेदं निरन्वयं तस्य भोगाभावः। कस्मात्?अन्येन विज्ञानेन कृतस्य कर्मणः अन्यत् कथं भोक्तृत्वेन अधिक्रियेत ?। स्मृत्यभावश्च, नान्यदृष्टस्य स्मरणम् अन्यस्यास्ति इति। वस्तुप्रत्यभिज्ञानाच्च स्थितोऽन्वयी धर्मी, यो धर्मान्यथात्वमभ्युपगतः प्रत्यभिज्ञायते। तस्मात् नेदं धर्ममात्रं निरन्वयम् इति ॥१४॥

 Still, due to the limitation of space, time, form and cause, there is no manifestation of all the natures at the same time.That which underlies these manifested and unmanifested characteristics and is the substratum of both the general (past and future ) and specific (present) forms is the object which is constant.

 To those however, who hold that this (the mind) is only a (series of) characteristics without a substratum, there must be an absence of experience. Why is that so? Because how can another cogniser be considered the experiencer of the action done by another cogniser. Moreover, there would be no memory thereof, since no one can remember something seen by another. Since objects (previously seen) are recognised (it is proved that) there is a substratum which is constant and which is recognised as common to the changing characteristics. For this reason it is not true that this is only (a series of) characteristics without a constant substance.

 Question—What is this called the substance (the characterised )? 

 Answer—That which stays steady while a quality disappears and a change of appearance of another quality occurs. "tatra” *śānto . . . dharmī*, i.e., that which has the nature of accompanying past, present and future qualities; i.e., that is called a substance which accompanies different (qualities) without changing its nature. "yogyatā. . dharmaḥ", i.e., a property is so called because (it has such a capacity); thus that capacity of becoming an ear-ring, etc., of the substance gold is its capacity to attain the shape of a girdle, ear-ring, etc., (and) that is quality.

 "sa. ca" and so on; though being undifferentiated in the substance it (is inferred by different results). This is like a lump of gold giving birth to a large ear-ring in another place or at another time. By observing the rise of that quality (one infers that) that substance can give rise to other and other properties (qualities); thus there is “phala. bhāvaḥ" ( the inference of the rise of different results ) in the substance. "ekasya. .nyaśca",[^1]¹

i.e., one substance has (different properties); therefore it is mentioned that one substance has innumerable qualities.

1\. Available readings have "ekasyānyo' nyaśca paridṛṣṭaḥ, tatra. "whereas the Vivaraṇa reading is "ekasyānyaścānyaśca; dṛṣṭaḥ tatra..."

 "tatra. and so on.[^140]¹

[^140]: "The Vivaranakāra places "

(The present experiences activity like bringing water, etc.) "yadā. bhidyate", i.e., (when it, the property, stays) in the form of the substance then being of the very nature of the substance (what is this property) and in particular (how is it distinguished); i.e., the difference is only in the form of attaining to a state of activity and not by observing the rise of an accompanying cause[^141].

[^141]: "There is no new cause which comes in the wake of the changes of qualities in the system of SāṅkhyaYoga which believes in satkāryavāda."

 What are these properties which are past, present and the future ?[^142]“te khalu samantarāḥ[^1]”⁴

[^142]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not explain anything further than asking the question as to what the three properties are."

Similarly[^144]' the past (comes just after the present ).“kimartham. ", i.e., why do they not exist after (the past)? "pūrvapaścimābhāvāt[^145]", i.e., that which exists after something else is something that comes after; and the other is prior with reference to it. In this instance, there being an absence of something coming after and because it cannot itself be prior (to itself) there is an absence of something preceding and something following; therefore, there is nothing that comes after the past. “yathā samanantarah"

[^144]: "Similar to the present which comes just after the not-as-yet-manifested."

[^145]: "Available readings have “pūrvapaścimatāyā"

 The reading which says “tadanāgata ... vartamānasya" has no connection with the topic under discussion. Therefore the reading has to be "tadanagata atītasya[^146]"due to the meaning being compatible. How is that? When the subliminal-impression of activity is overcome for the first time by the subliminal-impression of restraint, then the subliminal-impression of activity gives up the state of present existence and having reached the past state again reaches the not-as-yet-manifested-state and becomes manifest in the present state; therefore, even if it is not immediately next to it

[^146]: "This reading is not there in the available texts nor is it suggested by other commentators like Miśra or Bhiksu."

1.The Vivaraṇakāra places "tatra" before "dṛṣṭaḥ" There is also nothing new added to the bhāṣya. He just illustrates the present quality (of a pot) as that of bringing water, etc. Since there is nothing new added it has not been translated again.

4\. Available readings have "trayaḥ śāntā uditā avyapadesyāśceti. tatra śāntā ye kṛtvā vyāpārānu- paratāḥ whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has "te... Sāntāḥ ye kṛtvā vyāpāramuparatāḥ" Instead of "anāgatasya lakṣaṇasya" the Vivaraṇakāra has "...anāgatalakṣaṇasya"

the not-as-yet-manifest is mentioned as coming immediately to the past. The past and future secondary qualities of the characteristics have only the common property of being the true nature of the substance[^147].

[^147]: "In essence the properties share the nature of the substance; and the secondary properties share the nature of the properties."

 "atha... ke", i.e., in order to indicate the not-as-yet-manifested he says—

"sarvam[^148]. "How is that? "tatro . dṛṣṭam[^1]",³

[^148]: "No explanation is given by the Vivaraṇakāra."

i.e., this is like the one taste exhibiting itself in an infinite variety of forms in sugarcane,in a medicinal herb, in camphor, etc., as sweet, bitter, etc. Similarly, form exhibits itself in many ways as white, black, etc. So also in the case with smell, etc[^150]."tathā . " and so on; (similarly) there is an infinite variety of tastes (among both immovable and movable objects).In movable things there is what is appropriate for immovable things such as the universal difference as fluid, red colour,etc. "tathā . . . nām"[^151] (similarly) there is (in) immovable things what is appropriate for movable things like different forms of fluid well-known in the Āyurveda (school) dealing with trees."

[^150]: "ādi takes care of sound, taste and touch. "

[^151]: "The section in Ayurveda dealing with the various different kinds of juices available from different kinds of trees."

 In this manner there are immovable properties in immovable things and movable properties in movable things; "ityevam. tmakam" = without the destruction of sattva, etc., (everything is in everything else). Thus there are hundreds of scriptural and traditional statements like "Brahmã created from the thumb, from the pores of the skin", etc.

 If everything is of the nature of everything else then everything will be available everywhere; then one should not grieve when there is separation from that one is fond of-he replies to such statements (through the words) “deśakāla. vyaktiḥ", i.e., because of the "apabandhaḥ" = obstruction of space,etc., (there is no manifestation) of all objects (at the same time).Only at some place and at sometime, something assuming a body of some form manifests in some place for investigating the cause of dharma, etc., as in the case of Rāhu and so on.[^152] And it is due to that, that there is a logical reconciliation of the sorrow that is due to the separation of what is loved.

[^152]: "Rāhu, a demon, is said to have disguised himself in order to drink the nectar churned out of the milk ocean. He was discovered by the sun and moon and consequently his head was cut-off from his body. This probably refers to this assumption of a body by Rahu which can only be explai ed by referring to dharma and adharma."

3.Available readings have "yatroktam. ." instead of "tatroktam.

Therefore, as there is an excessive number of objects in each[^153]it is not possible to denote their properties.

[^153]: "In the Sankhya-Yoga theory of satkāryavāda, each item is capable of being countless things in accordance with the theory of karma and the filling in activity of prakṛti."

 "ya dharmī" = (that which underlines ) the manifested and unmanifested (qualities) “sāmānyaviśeṣātmā" = of the nature denoted by the words sattva, etc.,(that is the constant substance). "yasya tu. bhogābhāvaḥ”, i.e., (in the case of those) who argue that the outer and the inner self (are only dharma) and in the case of those (who argue) that it is only consciousness (knowledge),in their view,since the properties are momentary the simultaneous existence (of objects) as past, present and future is logically inconsistent for the relationship of experiencer and experienced[^154].

[^154]: "If both are momentary, who is the experiencer and who the experienced."

 He indicates the absence of relationship through the word “kasmāt” “anyena . kriyeta" (of the action done by one consciousness another) consciousness cannot become the agent. In the case of an agent who acts towards gaining some result it is proper that there is a connection with the result. It is contradictory to have one person as agent of the action and another to be connected with its result.

 "smṛtyabhāvaśca” = there is also the absence of memory regarding objects that have been done and are yet to be done[^155]."anya. stīti",i.e., Vasumitra does not remember what Caitra has seen. “vastupratyabhijñānācca", i.e., since we recognise that this is that same object therefore "sthito pagataḥ" =(the substratum) is proven to be different from the characteristics and not different in itself; thus, though underlying changes like bangles,etc.,we recognise it as gold itself. “tasmāt vayamiti"
[^156]

[^155]: "Because the agent is momentary."

[^156]: "The Vivaraṇakāra gives no explanation for this and leaves it as such."

क्रमान्यत्वं परिणामान्यत्वे हेतुः ॥१५॥

 The change in sequence (of characteristic) is the cause for the change in mutation.

** एकस्य धर्मिण एक एव परिणाम इति प्रसक्तेः क्रमान्यत्वं परिणामान्यत्वे हेतुर्भवतीति।तद्यथा—चूर्णमृत्पिण्डमृद्घटमृत्कपालमृत्कणमृदिति क्रमः।यो यस्य धर्मस्य समनन्तरो धर्मः स तस्य क्रमः।पिण्डो घट उपजायत इति धर्मपरिणामक्रमः।** 

 If then it is construed that there can be only one mutation for one substance, it can be said that a change (difference) in the sequence (of characteristic) is the cause for the change (difference ) in mutation. Thus, for example, the order (sequence of change in clay in the case of a pot) is—clay as powder, clay kneaded into a lump, clay as a pot, clay as a potsherd, clay as pieces.

 That characteristic which immediately follows another characteristic is its sequence. The kneaded lump of clay appears as the pot—this is the sequence in the change of the characteristic.

** लक्षणपरिणामक्रमः, घटस्य अनागतात् वर्तमानभावः क्रमः। तथा पिण्डस्य वर्तमानादतीतभावः क्रमः। नातीतस्यास्ति क्रमः। कस्मात् ? पूर्वापरतायां हि सत्यां समनन्तरत्वम्।सा तु नास्ति अतीतस्य। तस्मात् द्वयोरेव लक्षणयोः क्रमः॥**

** तथा अवस्थापरिणामक्रमोऽपि घटस्य अभिनवस्य प्रान्ते पुराणता दृश्यते। सा च क्षणपरम्परा-ऽनुपातिना क्रमेण अभ्यूह्यमाना परां व्यक्तिम् आपादिता इति।धर्मलक्षणाभ्यां च विशिष्टोऽयं तृतीयः परिणाम इति॥**

** त एते क्रमाः धर्मधर्मिभेदे सति प्रतिलब्धस्वरूपाः। धर्मोऽपि धर्मी भवति अन्यधर्मापेक्षया इति। यदा तु परमार्थतो धर्मिणि अभेदोपचारद्वारेणाभिधीयते धर्मः, तदा अयम् एकत्वेनैव क्रमः प्रत्यवभासते ॥**

** चित्तस्य द्वये धर्माः परिदृष्टाश्च अपरिदृष्टाश्च।तत्र प्रत्ययात्मकाः परिदृष्टाः, वस्तुमात्राः अपरिदृष्टाः।ते च सप्तैव भवन्ति अनुमानेन प्रापितवस्तुमात्रसद्भावाः।**

**निरोधधर्मसंस्काराः परिणामोऽथ जीवनम्।  
चेष्टा शक्तिश्च चित्तस्य धर्मा दर्शनवर्जिताः॥इति॥१५॥**

 The sequence of change of secondary qualities is the sequential coming into being of the present state of a pot from its not-as-yet-manifested state of being. Similarly the sequence (of change of secondary qualities) is from the present state of being of kneaded clay to its past state of being.

 There is no (such) sequence (succession ) in the case of the past. Why is this so? (Only) when there is a relation of antecedent and sequent is there an immediate suc- cession. But that is not there in the case of the past. Therefore, sequence of change exists only in the case of two secondary qualities.

 Similarly, there is a sequence in the change of states as well. It is seen that a brand new pot becomes old in course of time. That 'oldness' can be inferred gradually, underlying succession of moments and (finally) reaching its last stage. This third change is different from (the changes of) characteristic and secondary qualities.

 All these sequences become manifest (only) when there is a distinction between the substance (characterised object) and its characteristic. Even a characteristic can become a characterised object in relation to the nature of another characteristic.

 But when the characterised object can itself be called the characteristic because of attributing to it an identity (with the substance) then this sequence appears to be only one.

 The characteristics of the mind (internal organ) are of two kinds, i.e.,(1) perceived (patent) and (2) unperceived (latent). Of these the perceived have the nature of cognitions (and) the unperceived have the nature of the substratum only (i.e., latent impressions of objects only). These (latent impressions) are only seven and their existence is established by inference. 'Restricted state of mind (nirodha), virtue and

vice (dharma), subliminal-impressions, change, life, volition and power are the char- acteristics of the mind which are unperceived.

 He now mentions the cause for the different changes—when change is established it is proper that the agent can practise saṃyama[^157]on the three changes[^158]. Since one can create ideas of past, etc., through some mark and not otherwise (therefore the sūtra) *kramānyatvam hetuḥ*. "ekasya . prasakteḥ", i.e., as there is non-difference between the substance and its properties, in order to achieve different changes, he mentions the (this) mark as “kramānyatvam". Sequence is the state of immediate succession and its difference is the change.

[^157]: "dhāraṇā, dhyāna and samādhi."

[^158]: "Past, present and future."

 There are three sequences which are distinguished mutually by different characteristics.The sequence of change of characteristic is different from the sequences of change of secondary qualities and change of states.The sequence of change of secondary quality is different from the sequences of change of characteristics and change of states. The sequence of change of state is different from the sequences of change of characteristics and secondary qualities. That difference amongst them which has reached a state well-known, that is what makes one infer the changes which are the effects of sequence; it is “anyatve hetuḥ” (the cause for change).

 "tadyathā cūrṇamṛd" and so on. For instance the substance clay changes into properties of powder, etc., which arise at different times having sequences. In all instances, due to the cognition of clay it indicates that the substance called clay underlies all qualities which are mutually distinguished as different like power, lump, pot, potsherd, pieces, etc.

चूर्णस्यानन्तरः पिण्डः,पिण्डस्यानन्तरो घटः,घटस्यानन्तराणि कपालानि,कपालानां कणा अनन्तरा इति धर्म एव चूर्णमृत्, पिण्डमृत्,घटमृत्,कपालमृत्,कणमृत्,इति क्रमः,धर्मान्तरस्य क्रमः।न लक्षणं,नाप्यवस्था।यथा— यो यस्य धर्मस्य समनन्तरो धर्मः स तस्य क्रमः।कथम् ? पिण्डो घट उपजायत इति पिण्डरूपा मृत् घटीभवतीत्यर्थः।अभेदोपचारेण पिण्डो घट उपजायत इत्युच्यते । न पुनः पिण्डो धर्मो धर्मान्तरात्मतां प्रतिपद्यते । पिण्डधर्मविमर्दनेन तद्विरोधी तदनन्तरं घटाख्यो धर्म उपजायते॥

 धर्मपरिणामश्च द्विविधः, तुल्यपरिणामश्चातुल्यपरिणामश्च। यथा पिण्डो घट उपजायत इत्यतुल्यपिण्डस्य, घटादिधर्मैर्मृदाख्यो धर्मी परिणमते, सः अतुल्यधर्मपरिणामः । यावच्च घटस्य जन्मनः प्रभृति आ कपालापत्तेः, तावत् घटरूपेणैव परिणमते मृदिति स तुल्यधर्मपरिणामः ।

 The lump comes immediately after powder, the pot immediately after the lump, the potsherds immediately after the pot, the pieces come immediately after the potsherds; thus the properties are "cūrṇamrt. " = ( clay as powder and so on); it is a sequence of a different property. It is not a secondary property nor a change of state. Thus “yo yasya . " and so on[^159]. How is this? “pindo yate" = the clay in the form of a lump becomes a pot. The phrase "pindo... yate" is to indicate the non-difference (between the two). It is not that the property as a lump attains in truth another property. By overcoming the property of a lump (of clay) the quality which is its opposer which comes immediately after, called a pot, comes into being.

[^159]: "The Vivaraṇakāra leaves the bhāṣya to speak for itself."

 The change of characteristics is also of two kinds: one which is similar and (the other) which is dissimilar. When the lump of clay becomes a pot that is dissimilar to the lump, the substance called clay changes through the characteristics of a pot; that is a change of characteristic which is dissimilar. From the time of the rise of the pot till the coming into being of the potsherds the clay keeps changing through the form of the pot itself; that is a change of characteristic which is similar.

 Similarly the mind which has its modifications restricted in the state of one-point- edness changes through similar characteristics like past and present thoughts; changes through dissimilar characteristics like emergence (of activity) and restriction; thus at the time of emergence (of activity) it attains dissimilar changes due to the characteristics of tranquil, frightful and deluded thoughts. Thus this "dharma. kramaḥ” has been mentioned.Now he describes the sequence of change of the secondary state (through the words) “laksaṇa bhāvaḥ[^160]."“tathā kramaḥ”,i.e., in the rise of the opposing characteristic (the sequence changes to past from present). (The past has no sequence.) The sequence of a secondary quality is that secondary quality which come

[^160]: "The Vivaraṇakāra mostly lets the bhāṣya speak for itself and adds very little to it by way of explana- tion of the present state."

immediately after the secondary quality of the present state in the characteristic[^161].The secondary quality of past existence does not have a secondary quality immediately succeeding it.

[^161]: "Thus this rules out the past as having a sequence."

 "kasmāt ? kramaḥ”, i.e., (there is sequence) of (the two only)— that which has not-as-yet come into being (and) that which is the present. The purpose for indicating the lack of sequence of the past state will be clear in the sūtra *kṣaṇa* .māt[^162].

[^162]: "YS, III.52. By practising samyama over the moments and their succession there arises knowledge born of viveka."

 "tathā.and so on,[^163] i.e., in the change of state (oldness is seen). “sā ca . and so on, i.e., at every moment by attacking (overpowering) the state of newness, oldness is born. In between, because of subtlety[^164] it is not noticed. Therefore, though existing in the interval (in between), the sequence is not noticed[^165].It will be inferred by the mark of manifestation at the end as That which has caused this oldness to become clearly manifest that is the sequence;' when the pot has just come into being, even though aging (oldness) also takes place every moment, it is not grasped.

[^163]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has the habit of using words and whole sentences from the bhāṣya to explain his points. Thus he hardly uses any of his words to explain this change of state."

[^164]: "The change is not noticeable visibly but subtly there is the transformation taking place."

[^165]: "This obvious repetition of the same idea in the same place is unlike Śankara's style."

 Thus it will be said (by Patañjali) *kṣaṇa* kramaḥ[^166]."). Therefore, since the sequence of change of state is different from the sequences of change of quality and secondary change “dharma. parināmaḥ" (this is different from the other two).

[^166]: "YS, IV.33 (Sequence is the counterpart of the moment which is grasped as such at the extreme limit of change

 “ta ete .. rūpāh", i.e., when the non-difference between the quality and the qualified is desired, there will be no difference of change of sequence. “dharmo'pi kṣayā", i.e., apart from the guṇas there is no arrangement known as being a substance or being a quality[^167]. Even mahat, etc., from the point of view of the unparticularised 

[^167]: "Everything is an arrangement of the guṇas."

are substances[^168].The unparticularised with reference to the particularised, the particularised with reference to the past and present (can be viewed as the characterised substance). "yadā bhāsate[^169]"

[^168]: "The sixteen manas, five motor organs, five sense-organs and the five gross elements are the particularised evolutes in the system; whereas the five subtle elements and the sense-of-I are the six unparticularised evolutes. Depending on how one wants to view them they can be spoken of as substance or attributes depending on the point of view."

[^169]: "The Vivaraṇakāra lets the bhāṣya speak for itself."

 In that context "cittasya. dṛṣṭāśca" (the mind has) two kinds (of qualities)—one that is perceived and the other not perceived.In order to answer the question as to what these are he says—"tatra. "and so on, i.e., attachment, hatred, delusion, etc., (of the nature of cognitions are the perceived). "vastumātrāḥ" those that exist in their own nature connected with effects are "aparidṛṣtāḥ" "te ca. bhavanti" (they), along with the modifications pertaining to their objects (are seven). How are they known? "anumānena. and so on—they are known by the mark of their effect, in their essence they are not perceived by those who do not have the power to do so[^170].Then they are mentioned one by one as "nirodha. " and so on.

[^170]: "īśvara here stands for the yogi who has the power to perceive such things."

 "nirodha. rāḥ" restraint has been mentioned (described);"dharmaḥ" = both merit and demerit; "saṃskārāḥ" = of the nature of latent impressions; "pariṇāmaḥ" = having the quality already mentioned. “atha jīvanam” = with reference to dharma etc., that which takes place through the quality of the mind, which is the instrument of all activity of the nature of life (living) that is called "jīvanam" "ceṣṭā" = activity; "śaktiḥ" = the capacity (to act)—these are the properties of the mind. "darśana. tāḥ" not perceived. "iti = (thus) these seven beginning with restraint are the unperceived properties of the mind.

एते योगिन उपात्तसर्वसाधनस्य बुभुत्सितार्थप्रतिपत्तये संयमस्य विषय उपक्षिप्यते—

 The following are described as the objects of 'saṃyama' (and the attainments), when a yogi who has mastered all the means (of yoga) has the desire to know (any particular) subject.

**परिणामत्रयसंयमादतीतानागतज्ञानम् ॥१६॥**

 When saṃyama is practised on the three mutations (changes) there is knowledge of the past and future.

**धर्मलक्षणावस्थापरिणामेषु संयमाद्योगिनां भवत्यतीतानागतज्ञानम्।धारणाध्यानसमाधित्रयमेकत्र संयम उक्तः।तेन परिणामत्रयं साक्षात्क्रियमाणमतीतानागतज्ञानं तेषु संपादयति ॥१६॥**

 When 'saṃyama' is practised on the mutations of characteristics, secondary qualities and states, yogīs obtain knowledge of the past and the future.

 It has already been mentioned that the three—concentration, meditation and one-ness with the object—when directed towards the same object, is 'saṃyama' When there is direct perception of the three mutations through 'saṃyama' there is obtained knowledge of the past and future with reference to them.

 “ete" = (these) three changes of the form of characteristics, secondary changes and change of states, “yogī nasya"= in the case of one who has mastered all the means (of yoga, like yama, etc.), who is very steady-in saṃyama[^171]; “bubhu pyate" = the object of saṃyama is mentioned-(when there is desire to know the object) which is close to the past and future (states[^172]). All the three[^173] form one object for saṃyama.

[^171]: "The Vivaraṇakāra just gives a word to word meaning here."

[^172]: "As these are only temporal states as described in YS, III.15."

[^173]: "Past, present and future states."

 "pariṇāma. .jñānam”, i.e., saṃyama is to be done on the three changes till there is the light of samādhi insight. And that reveals directly, as it is, that object which is the object of it.[^174]

[^174]: "Object of samādhi."

 Saṃyama done on subtle (objects such as ) subtlety, hidden, past, future or obstructed (things) with the object of mastering them, that object comes under the control of the yogī.

 "dharma uktaḥ[^175]”.“tena .pādayati" = by saṃyama (there is knowledge of the three states with reference to those changes. As all substances change (have change) and as they are connected with the temporal states such as past, etc., by practising saṃyama on the three changes which is something associated with all substances connected with the three temporal states, there is direct perception of everything (all substances). Thus in one who is observing the world (universe) as unsteady, having the property of change at every moment, there arises detachment.

[^175]: "No explanation is given for this by the Vivaraṇakāra."

**शब्दार्थप्रत्ययानामितरेतराध्यासात्संकरस्तत्प्रविभागसंयमात्सर्वभूतरुतज्ञानम् ॥१७॥**

 There is confusion because a word, its intended object and the idea (conveyed) are superimposed on one another. If saṃyama is practised on them separately there is knowledge of the sounds of all living beings.

** तत्र वाग्वर्णेष्वेवार्थवती। श्रोत्रं च ध्वनिपरिणाममात्रविषयम्।पदं पुनर्नादानुसंहारबुद्धिनिर्ग्राह्यमिति।वर्णा एकसमयासंभवित्वात्परस्परनिरनु-ग्रहात्मानः,ते पदमनुपसंस्पृश्यानुपस्थाप्याविर्भूतास्तिरोभूताश्चेति प्रत्येकमपदस्वरूपा उच्यन्ते।**

 Among these the organ of speech relates only to the alphabets which constitute the word. The organ of hearing relates only to the change of sound. But a word is grasped by the intelligence by binding together sounds in succession into one unified whole.

 Since many letters cannot be uttered simultaneously they cannot aid each other. Without forming a word and without conveying any meaning they just appear and disappear. Therefore it is said that they (the individual letters) lack the nature of a word.

 वर्णः पुनः एकैकः सर्वाभिधानशक्तिप्रचितः सहकारिवर्णान्तरप्रतियोगित्वात् वैश्वरूप्यमिवापन्नः उत्तर पूर्वेण पूर्वश्चोत्तरेण विशेषेऽवस्थापितः, इत्येवं बहवो वर्णाः क्रमानुरोधिनोऽर्थसङ्केतेन अवच्छिन्नाः इयन्त एते सर्वाभिधानशक्तिपरिच्युताः गकारौकारविसर्जनीयाः सास्नातिमन्तमर्थं द्योतयन्ति इति॥

 But each letter is the essence and is imbued with the power of expressing all ideas; when combined with other connected letters it has universal application as it were; in a particular relationship (of a word) a succeeding alphabet is connected with a preceding one and a preceding with a succeeding one. In this way, many alphabets following a particular sequence are conditioned to convey (particular) meanings due to convention. Thus, though deprived of the capacity of denoting all things, a certain number of these alphabets such as the alphabets 'ga' 'au' and 'ḥ' (in this order) convey the meaning of an animal with dewlap &c.

 Thus conditioned by conventional meaning these sounds (alphabets) which have been uttered in a particular sequence is a single unit illumined (understood) by the intelligence; that is the uttered word which indicates the one thing signified. Thus a single word is the object of a single mental process; it is brought into existence by one single effort; it is undivided (into alphabets); it is without (reference to) any sequence of alphabets; it is manifested by operation of the notion of the final sound.

 If a man desires to convey information to another, he expresses himself through (these) sounds which are listened to by others. (Then) the mind of the common man which has latent impressions of usage of speech from beginningless time, thinks it to be something real in itself as a result of (common) understanding.

 Thus due to the conventional knowledge that a group of such letters in succession denote such and such a meaning, there arises this sort of division of words.

 Convention takes the form of erroneous identification of the word and its meaning; it is based on memory; 'this word is the same as this object and this object is the same as this word'—thus convention takes the form of erroneous identification of the two. Similarly by erroneous identification of the word, its intended object and the idea (conveyed) there is confusion between the word 'cow' (gauḥ), its meaning 'cow' (gauh) and the idea 'cow'

  He who knows the distinction between these (three) he is 'all-knowing'

  Every word has the potentiality to express a (complete) sentence. When the word 'tree' (vṛkṣa) is uttered the word 'is' automatically follows, since an object signified by a word cannot but exist. So also no action expressed (by a verb) is possible without its means. Thus when one says 'cooks' all the factors related to cooking are implied. One expressly mentions Caitra as the agent, fire as the means and rice as the object of cooking, in order to specify the meaning.

 It is also seen that words are so constructed as to convey the meaning of a sentence. Thus the word 'śrotriya' means 'one who recites Vedic hymns' and the word 'jīvati' (lives) means 'one who has got the breath of life'. (Since) a word is capable of conveying the meaning (as) in the above sentence therefore, the word has to be separated and analysed grammatically to see whether it expresses an action or a nominal case. Otherwise in such examples as bhavati, aśvaḥ, ajāpayaḥ &c., how can one construe a word as a verb or a noun when due to external similarity between a nominal and a verbal form it is not known (as such).

 There is a distinction between the word, the meaning and the idea (conveyed). Thus in the sentence 'the palace shines white', (śvetate) signifies an action (whitens); in the sentence 'the white palace' the word (śvetah) signifies a noun.

 The meaning of that word is in essence a verb as well as a noun. (It conveys) the idea as well. How is this so? Because of the identity of the form 'this is that' the conventional meaning and the idea (conveyed) are identical.

 That which is the white object is the support of both the word and the idea (conveyed). That undergoes changes through its (different states and does not correspond to the word or the idea (conveyed). Similarly, in this way, the word and the idea do not correspond to each other.

 Thus the word is different, so is the intended object different, and so is the idea (conveyed) different. They are thus distinct (from each other). Thus by practising 'saṃyama' on them separately, a yogīacquires the knowledge of the sounds of all living beings (creatures).

 He introduces the following different objects of saṃyama[^176]which has the purpose of gaining the meanings of all words (as) *śabdārtha*. .*jñānam*. In that context (he says): What is the word, what is the meaning or the idea (presented), what is the reason for confusion and how are they distinguished (separated)?

[^176]: "The Vivaraṇakāra starts the explanation in exactly the same way as Miśra in his Tattvavaiśāradī. Miśra has ‘ayamaparaḥ samyamasya viṣaya upakṣipyate'—which is exactly what the Vivaraṇakāra has by just substituting the word 'anyaḥ' for 'aparaḥ' "

 “tatra”, i.e., is a word, a sound to be uttered which is grasped by the ear, or does it have another meaning, or is it just a word or different from it—

he thus ruminates (that) word is not a sound. Why is that so? "vāk.. vatī", i.e., the word is manifested through letters; the sense-organ (of speech) clinging to the eight places (of utterance[^177]) exhausts itself after serving the purpose of just manifesting the letters,it does not exert itself either in the manifestation of the meaning or in the manifestation of the word.

[^177]: "Breast, throat, head, root of the tongue, palate, teeth, lips, nose."

 Similarly[^178] “śrotram (the ear) is not itself word nor does it have word as its object. Why is that so? “dhvani ' it has (only the object of sound change). Sound in general is with or without the form of letters. Its special transformation is of the nature of the letters ‘a', etc.[^179]; it is also of the nature of the crying of birds like the crow, etc., it is indicated by bodily gestures (hands) by one who is stupid[^180]. The ear exhausts itself by just illuminating the change of sound and does not produce either the word or the meaning[^181].

[^178]: "The letters do not do that."

[^179]: " All the various alphabets beginning with 'a'"

[^180]: "All these can be called words."

[^181]: "Sound as alphabetical letters, calling of birds and suggested meanings through bodily gestures."

  Objection—But then, word is grasped only by the ear.

 Answer—Not so, as it makes the meaning known[^182] can also grasp the word."). That which makes known the meaning is a word. What is that? It is "padam" (word). "tatpunar hyam[^183]".Each of 

[^182]: "Thus the intellect (or instrument of cognition

[^183]: "The bhāsya has no “tat' but theVivaraṇakāra adds it."

the sounds which is the object of the ear departs after depositing its impression on the mind (intellect); that cognition which arises through the last sound is the intelligence that binds together in succession the sounds; this arises in the knowing mind accomplished by the latent impressions which come into being in succession following the sequence from the first sound[^184];through one act of intelligence (cognition) it (word) is grasped.That is word. As it is experienced directly it does not need any other means of evidence and is like colour,etc.

[^184]: "Thus it arises in the same order resulting in the desired word. It explains why there is no mixing up of the order of letters in words which have the same letters like 'kapi' and 'pika'"

 Objection — But then, Bhagavān[^185] Upavarṣa says (the word gauh is composed of) the letter 'ga', 'au' and the aspirate (:).

[^185]: "Mark of respect."

 Answer — That is not so; as it cannot be uttered. How is that? As there is no collection ( at one time[^186]."));
and the absence of a collection is due to “eka. tvāt” (the non-existence collectively at the same time). When the letter 'ga' is uttered the letters 'au' and aspirate (cannot be uttered); so also when ‘au' is spoken 'ga' and aspirate (cannot be spoken); and at the time that the aspirate is active (uttered) the other two do not coexist; therefore due to the absence (simultaneously) of the collection of letters it[^187] cannot be uttered.

[^186]: "At the same time all the letters together cannot be uttered (or for that matter written

[^187]: "The word gauḥ."

 Just as letters cannot exist together at the same time so also those generated by latent impressions and memories, not existing at the same time, cannot be expressed.In the case of memory the object is already experienced and in the case of latent impression only an experienced object is of use and in the case of the object to be known it has to be not known before[^188].

[^188]: "These are the general definitions of the different categories."

 Moreover if one accepts that latent impressions can be expressed (then, such statements) as 'There is understanding of meaning from words; 'The state of before and after was made known by communicating'; 'As dharma has its basis on word (Veda), not having words will be irrelevent' will lose their credibility[^189].

[^189]: "In none of the statements is their a direct understanding from the latent impressions themselves—it is all through words."

 Question—

Even so, since the existence of letters is known, it is expected that both 

memory and latent impression can be expressed[^190].

[^190]: "In the expression of the letters themselves."

 Answer—

That is also not so; the knowing of its existence happens only when it exists and when it is not there it is as if it does not exist[^191]. When letters gain existence as sound they exist. Ordinary people, by attributing the sense-of-I to the body, etc., through lack of discrimination, attribute truth even to that which is not truth-there- fore in deciding what is true it cannot be a cause in all instances.

[^191]: "Thus memory and latent impression cannot be expressed even if the ordinary people think it can be."

 Moreover when word is acted on by the ear[^192]there is understanding of meaning; as there is no exception to this (rule), being a word depends on knowing its[^193] existence. Therefore the last letter is not a denoter[^194]' because it is a letter, just as the first letter[^195].Similarly, the memory or impression of the word are not denoters (of the word) because they are memory and latent impressions like the memory and latent impression of the first letter.

[^192]: "Only when word is heard by the ear is any meaning understood, not otherwise."

[^193]: "The fact of being heard by the ear."

[^194]: "Of the word, as for instance the visarga in the case of gauḥ'"

[^195]: "The Vivaraṇakāra states it as a syllogism."

 Question—

If it is said that the last letter along with the impressions generated by the earlier letters is the denoter (of the meaning) then (the answer is) it is not so. Why is that so? Because there is the contingency of understanding the meaning by just uttering the last letter[^835].⁷

[^835]: #

How is that ( possible ) ? The hearer has all the impressions of letters like ‘ga’, etc., created (by uttering them) on the previous days; therefore the meaning can be known by just the utterance of the last letter.

 Question—

If it is said that the first (earlier) letters are uttered to convey a fixed meaning then (the answer is) it is not so; as the earlier letters do not have the same moment (time) of utterance as the later letter there is absence of utility and (so) there cannot be any rule regarding this.

 Question—If it is said that in your case as well, the same defect applies, i.e., when letters manifest words the earlier letters are uttered in order to convey a fixed meaning and so following the idea of manifestation of a word it is proper to consider letters themselves as having the capacity to denote the word then (the answer is); that is not 

7\. "There is no need to utter the whole word with all its letters in that event.

so; it is proper to accept that the letters only place their respective latent impressions in the intellect.

 The word shines when in the intellect there is collected a series of impressions of letters which have gone out of existence after being uttered. This is what is meant by the manifestation of the word by letters; they do not function directly like a lamp with regard to the word[^196].

[^196]: "Thus this generally accepted position is explained by the Vivaraṇakāra."

 It is not right to understand a mutual relation of benefactor and benefited (amongst the impressions) through the substance due to the fact that the impressions all occupy the same support in the intellect[^197];it is because there are (in the intellect impressions that) help in acquiring good (liked) and bad ( not liked) objects like memory, desire, hatred, etc. It is not proper to imagine at one time connection between the last letter and the impressions of the memory of the earlier letters.

[^197]: "These various theories present the prevalence of them in various circles."

 Question—

If it is said that in my case also since (the word) is generated by the intellect in which is collected a series of impressions created by a fixed order of (uttered) letters (then the answer is) that is not so; since there is abandoning of what is obtained.

 If the intellect is qualified by impressions of many letters does it have the meaning as its object or the word as its object? If it has the meaning as object that itself achieves the word; since it makes known the meaning; if it is said it has the word as its object then also, as there is knowledge of the meaning from the word, there is a contradiction.

 Therefore it is proper to accept that the word is different from letters and is the object of a single intellect, (understanding ).

 Thus the last letter along with the impressions generated by the earlier letters, its memory or its impression is not the denoter (of meaning), as this is dependent on the help of impressions just as understanding.

 In such a situation how is it that the letters do not have either the word or the meaning as object?

 He (Vyāsa) answers that (through the words) "varṇāḥ . " and so on. A word exists in a certain order (of letters) and so cannot exist at the same time[^198]. Therefore "paraspara. naḥ" = due to lack of a connecting link they do not aid each other. "te pada. pya[^1]"²

[^198]: "'All the letters forming that word in a particular order cannot be uttered at the same time."

without fixing themselves in a word "āvir . svarūpāḥ" = separately or collectively they do not even touch remotely the essence of the word. By not existing simultaneously, even collectively they do not have the nature of the word. Then what to speak of each of the parts which stay without any meaning attached[^200].

[^200]: "Individual letters do not convey any meaning."

 "varṇaḥ. citaḥ[^201]"⁴

[^201]: "The available readings have “padātmā” after “punarekaikaḥ"

= the (words) through which there is denotation (of meaning) are the words which denote; imbued with manifesting capacity of all the words which denote (meaning) they are like individual spokes in the nave of a wheel[^202].Thus the letter 'ga' is imbued with the capacity to manifest the meaning of all such words as 'go', 'varga', 'agni', ‘gagana', etc.

[^202]: "Each letter is compared to a spoke-collectively they help in motion so also with letters in conveying the meaning."

 "saha tvāt", i.e., as the word 'gauḥ' is dependent on the cooperation of 'ga' 'au' and aspirate (visarga), so also (in the word) agni, (g) is accompanied by 'i'.[^203]Therefore, due to a relationship of dependence amongst many letters every word "vaiśva. nnaḥ" (has universal application as it were). "uttaraśca[^1] "⁷

 "evam. ." and so on; i.e., there is a particular sequence, which binds (the letters) to what comes earlier and what comes later (i.e., an order). "artha.

 It is through the convention of (the arrangement of) letters that there is the convention of a word. A word (in turn) is governed by the convention dependent on the special sequence of the letters; its convention is the convention of (the arrangement of) the letters themselves. “iyanta. cyutāḥ[^205]",¹

[^205]: "Available readings have “. . . śaktiparivṛtaḥ” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “ śaktiparicyutāh”"

i.e, as it has the function of revealing a special word which conveys meaning such as one qualified by dewlap, etc., they turn away, they are deprived of the power to reveal (the meaning of) other words; "gakara. yanti[^206]"²

[^206]: "Though the reading is "

= due to the strength of dependence on mutual special arrangement (and) being indifferent to the capacity of revealing (the meaning) of other words the word (guah) manifests (the meaning of an animal with dewlap, etc.).

 "tade[^1] "³

and so on; in the said reasonable manner when there is a collection of a special arrangement of the letters the relationship that is generated by this special order in the above-mentioned sequence is the illumination of the intelligence[^208]; "tat padam" that is the basis; like the earth[^209] (it is the denoter of the denoted) and (is indicated) through letters.

[^208]: "It is understood by the intellect and belongs to it."

[^209]: "Not the letters themselves but this word arranged in a special way."

 “tat . . ekam[^210]”⁶

[^210]: "The Vivaranakāra has the order "

the word is one; an object having parts like a pot, etc., is seen to be the object of many intelligences[^211],but a word is not like that. That is “ekabuddhi- viṣayam" directly experienced by all (as the object of one understanding). The letters

[^211]: "Thus a pot can be an object for many people; but this is not so in the case of the word."

1\. Available readings have "...śaktiparivṛtaḥ" whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has ". Saktiparicyutāḥ"

2\. Though the reading is". dyotayanti" the Vivaraṇakāra has "avadyotayanti"  
3. Available readings have "upasaṃhṛtadhvani "whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has "anugṛhītadhvani"  
6. The Vivaraṇakāra has the order "tat padamekam" instead of "tadekam padam"

 being many and not rising simultaneously,do not reach the status of being the object of a single understanding. If one desires to reject this understanding by a single intelligence by inference, then that would be contrary to what is known directly.

 Similarly “eka . sthāpitam" = by the mature understanding of the intellect caused by the latent impressions brought together by the rise of the sequence of the letters it is revealed at once in the last understanding (notion of the last sound). “[avibhāgam](http://3 "Instead of ")"=¹

it is without parts and so "akrama . . . pitam[^212]"=²

[^212]: "Instead of “.. avarṇam bauddham antya. "

it is revealed just by the knowledge of the last letter accompanied by the sequential operation of the earlier letters.

 "paratra. tīyate[^213]"(to convey information) it is conveyed through sounds that denote meanings; there is revolving in the circle of the beginningless world of birth and death; there is worldly action which is preceded by understanding the meaning from words; it is known as if fixed by the intellect which is informed by the latent impressions of the words; as for the activity of everyday life which is of a deluded nature having the purpose of just worldly activity, there is confusion regarding a word as there is regarding the self[^214].

[^213]: "There is not much added to the bhāṣya by the Vivaraṇakāra except a word here and there."

[^214]: "The true nature of the word is as much a matter of speculation as the nature of the self is. This is a hint at the various theories regarding the nature of word. It is difficult to make out how Leggett translates this as he does. Cf. Trevor Leggett, śaṇkara on the Yogasūtras, p. 315,"

 Therefore the word is different from the letters (that compose it); because when it is grasped by a single understanding there is proof (of its existence) like a lamp[^215]; as there is a cause for comprehending the meaning (of a word) it is like a lamp, it is like the intellect. The letters are not the word as they are uttered in sequence by an agent

[^215]: "Like a lamp that illuminates, the understanding points to the existence of the word."

(speaker), having the nature of an instrument and are like a hatchet,a chisel,etc. In this connection someone[^216]says—

[^216]: "The reference is to Kumārilabhaṭṭa's discussion on sphota in the Ślokavārttika, X.131-36."

  Letters or sounds reveal (the meaning) of words and sentences as they have the power to reveal like a lamp and its light and not because of sphoța-(alternate meaning)—The letters or sounds of a word or sentence are not sphota; they reveal the meaning as they have the power to reveal like a lamp and its light.

 When the meaning is understood, because of the different workings of the mind, depending on one's desire, there are many causes present (for the meaning ) as in the case of a pot, etc.

 The meaning is not denoted by sphota which is different from the letters and whose substance is not proven; it is not like a pot, etc., contradicting what is perceived.

 If one rejects the letters because (the meaning) rises after their knowledge then there will be contradiction of what is seen like the rejection of the hare in the moon.

 The meaning is understood from letters or it rises immediately after knowing them; that rising (of meaning ) is like the knowledge of fire from (seeing) smoke.

 Or like a lamp 'ga', etc., is the revealer of the (meaning of the) word ‘gauḥ'; as it is well-known and also it is definitely present before it.

 It is said: “varṇāvākyayoḥ”, i.e., ( meanings of ) words and sentences are not known by themselves. When there is no word or sentence apart from letters (it is understood that) sphota does not reveal (meaning of) words and sentences. In such a situation how can there be exchange of communication between thinkers[^217].When this 

[^217]: "The grammarians to which school Bhartṛhari belonged."

is so, rejecting sphoṭa (in revealing the meaning) of words and sentence there is the acceptance of words and sentence (for conveying meaning).

  Even so, if we voice the opinion of the other, then there is the fallacy of proving what is already proven[^218].Apart from the words and sentence of the other, there is no other sphoṭa[^219], which can be denied. Sphoța is present only in the words and the sentence.

[^218]: "One of the hetvābhāsas which vitiate inference."

[^219]: "Only words and sentences are present and not anything other than that."

 It may still be said that the letters placed in a special sequence (order) which delimit the meaning, deny both the word and the sentence (as conveying meaning). That is also not right as it is self-contradictory.

 It can again be said that there is denial of anything other than letters, whether it is words or a sentence. Still with reference to that which is denied, as there is rejection of its manifestation, it contradicts the presence of words and sentences which are denied[^220].

[^220]: "Something which is directly experienced cannot be denied."

 Even so let there be denial of word and sentence imagined by another[^221]; even then, the mark is not proven because it is manifested. How is that? There is either manifestation of the word which is different from itself (letters) or there is manifestation of something which is not different or there is manifestation of the meaning of the let- ters—thus there are three options. If there is manifestation of what is different[^222], then there will be the fallacy of self-contradiction.

[^221]: "In the manifestation of meaning only sphoṭa is admitted and not word or sentence."

[^222]: "i.e., the word."

 Then if it is said that there is (manifestation of) that which is not different then again there is no proof of what the other means. Moreover, there is manifestation and manifestation is always of something different and not of something not different as in the case of a lamp. The revealer like a lamp, etc., is made use of in order to reveal another and not to reveal oneself. If it is made use of in order to reveal itself then even a man born blind can reveal himself[^223].

[^223]: "The meaning is not quite clear. Leggett translates this as 'there is after all self-manifestation by darkness too'—unless he had another reading it is not possible to understand how he arrived at that meaning. Cf. Leggett, op. cit., p. 317."

 Then when it is established that there is revealing of another they could manifest either the word or the meaning. Therein it could accomplish many things like a palanquin for carrying, etc., that cannot be done by any one member; similarly any one of the letters is not capable of revealing the meaning as it is to be accomplished by many—

this has been demonstrated.

 Like the maxim of the digger of a well it cannot also be said that one by one the letters deposit their latent impression by suggestion and then disappear; this is because the denoted is the object of a single idea (intelligence).

 Just as knowledge that ends at the end of a good deed is not capable of depositing impressions of future knowledge due to the absence of any existent substance, so also, due to lack of mutual relation the letters which arise at different moments of time, the later ones rising as the earlier ones are destroyed, cannot have the force to deposit their impressions; so letters are not the manifestors of the meaning (of the word).

 In short, the accepted theory is that they reveal the distinct (meaning of the word) itself. We believe that in the fixed mind substance (intellect) which is illuminated by the ripening of a series of impressions brought about by each preceding letter, at the moment of the birth of the last letter, there arises an illumination of intelligence capable of being grasped by a single idea without parts; thus there is no defect of incapacity to deposit the impression[^224].

[^224]: "That is the view of the Vivaraṇakāra."

 किं च, यद्यपि वर्णाः स्वबुद्धिं व्यञ्जयन्ति। सा बुद्धिरर्थप्रतीतिं प्रति करणभूतैवाभिव्यज्यते, न तु फलं प्रति वर्णाः करणत्वेन व्याप्रियन्ते। करणभूतबुद्धयुत्पादनोपक्षयत्वात् । बुद्धेरेव हि फलं प्रति व्यापारः। यस्य हि फलं प्रति व्यापारः तत् प्रमाणं, स शब्दः।ततश्च अर्थप्रतीतिं प्रति कारणभूतबुद्धिव्यवहितत्वात् न वर्णानां वाचकत्वम् । परम्परया तु पदं प्रत्युपायत्वं न वर्णानां प्रतिषिध्यते॥

  Moreover, even if letters manifest the meaning (of the word) that idea (through letters) is revealed as instrumental with reference to the understanding of meaning; and towards the result[^225]the letters do not function as instruments, as it exhausts itself in creating the instrument—

[^225]: "Result is the meaning of the word. There is no direct connection of meaning to letters but only as instruments in creating an idea which then leads to understanding this seems to be the purpose of this statement."

idea. Towards the result only the intellect operates. That which functions with reference to the result is the authority (and) that is the word. Thus towards the understanding of meaning as there is the idea as cause in between, letters do not denote (the meaning). There is (however) no denial of the letters forming a word through a sequence[^226]. Therefore this verse has to be read in the following way[^227].Śaṇ

[^226]: "This seems very unlike the style of Śaṅkara."

[^227]: "The first verse quoted above from the Ślokavārttika.To rewrite the verses of another, to suit one's interpretation is totally out of character of Śaṇkara.Here is a work written by Kumarilabhaṭṭa and to imagine Śaṅkara would rewrite those is beyond understanding. He has either interpreted the scriptures to fit his advaita, he has written original works advocating many ideas but it would be difficult to imagine Śaṇkara rewriting a whole set of verses, specially of such an authority as Kumārilabhaṭṭa, for what seems to be a trivial twist of meaning."

 Letters or sounds in themselves as manifestors of meaning reveal something different, just as the light of a lamp, etc.

  Similarly in the case of a pot and so on, it is proper to understand that they convey a different meaning. Pots, etc., convey the idea of capacity to cook, carry, store and such other (ideas) just by seeing them. So also, letters by succession, have the purpose of conveying a word other than itself (themselves ) and are like a pot, etc., (in that sense); so the following verse is similarly understood —

  According to one's inclination, when the meaning is understood due to the different workings of the mind, there are many causes present (for the meaning), as in the case of a pot, etc.

  By all means, let there be something that is produced or the idea (which conveys meaning) by which sometimes when the uttered letters are destroyed and not in existence there is the understanding of meaning apart from letters, that is sphoța. And that is an effect that is to be certainly accepted because there are no letters. Then the statement 'Sphoṭa is not the denoter of meaning apart from the letters', will be difficult to accept. Moreover, another unproven point is 'apart from letters' there is no proof of separation (of letters ) from oneself.

Moreover, one who accepts the fourfold division of nouns, verbs, affixes and particles has to admit something other than letters which manifest something produced (universal). Letters do not try to manifest the universal of a word. Letters manifest the universal of letters. When parts arise and disappear at different times it cannot explain the manifestation of the universal of the whole[^228] do not exist simultaneously at the time of production of the whole it cannot manifest the universal of the whole object denoted by the word."). Even when the parts are lasting such as hands and feet, for instance, they do not manifest the property of a body without the body (itself). Then what to speak of those not even lasting. Moreover, in such statements like 'aśvaḥ ayātamayātamakṣaḥ bhavati, tena mama vāyurvāyuḥ', etc., when the words have the same form, being both a noun and a verb, having mutually a contradictory nature, they cannot indicate the one same letter.

[^228]: "As the parts (here letters

 If 'a', 'śa', ‘va' and visarjanīya (:), the indicators of the word 'aśvaḥ' as the class of the noun are diferent from the manifesters of the class of 'aśva' as verb, then it is logical that different letters indicate different classes—

that is not proper in the same word.

 Even if one understands from works (collections) dealing with meanings and words that 'this is a noun' and 'this is a verb' still works dealing with meaning, etc., cannot make one letter denote the class of both a noun and a verb. For instance, a brāhmaṇa cannot manifest both the class of a brāhmaṇa and that of a kṣatriya. Therefore many 'a' 'śa' 'va' and such letters are desired[^229]. So also the words 'go', etc., are also different. Thus we have the class of the word 'go' and the class of the word 'aśva' so also the classes of ‘ma', ‘ā’, ‘i', 'ī' also are established.

[^229]: "To solve the problem raised."

 In that way the letters 'a', etc., manifest the universals 'a', etc., and not the words ‘aśva' etc., and their difference as a noun or verb.

Thus one has to accept a word different from letters that manifests the universal property of a word. In that way, the following verse is to be understood as follows: If sphota is rejected, which arises after the understanding of letters, there will be contradiction of what is seen like the rejection of the hare in the moon. This idea arising from letters, but not of letters, rises immediately after the knowledge of them.

 

As there is intervention of the idea of instrument (cause) its arising immediately afterwards is not proven. If one then says that it arises in succession there is the defect of trying to prove what is already proven. Even in the case of smoke with reference to the idea of fire it does not have the property of cause; (in this case) it is the idea of smoke which has the property of cause. Just as smoke, etc., (are causes) in succession[^230]so also the capacity of letters, etc., having the capacity to help (in producing meaning) by succession; (that) is desired (in this verse). So this verse also has to be read in the following way—

[^230]: "In the case of fire. The whole argument smacks of that of a Naiyāyika. It is difficult to imagine Śaṇkara quibbling like this and is more like the writing of one showing off his Nyāya leanings. The entire argument hinges on 'samanantara' interpreted as 'coming immediately after'"

 

The idea of meaning does not arise from letters as it arises after knowing them; it arises from them like the idea of fire which does not come about (immediately after) seeing smoke, etc.

 

Like a lamp the letters 'g' and 'au' coming together do not manifest the meaning of one having a dewlap, etc., as they do not exist at the time of manifestation of meaning. This anomaly seen with regard to them of not existing (at the time of meaning, etc.) also applies with reference to the aspirate (visarjanīya) as well. Letters are not coexistent with the manifestation of meaning, whereas a lamp exists at the same time as the object it illumines (and) thus attains a causality.

 

Therefore that verse (above) is also to be read as follows: ‘g', etc., do not denote words like 'go', etc., similar to a lamp; as it (the lamp) is definitely known and is present before (the object is revealed).

 

There is also authority for this there are no denoters for meaning,nor are letters an authority with reference to meaning since they depend directly on convention like numbers,images, etc. Just as numbers like hundred, etc., and images of Viṣṇu, etc., depending on convention, reveal what has come down (from father to son) With reference to the meaning Viṣṇu, hundred, etc., they do not serve as authority. .

 

यत्तु नापेक्षते सङ्केतं, तत् प्रमाणम्, यथा वाक्यं, दीपादिजात्यन्तरं च। न तथा वर्णा इति प्रतिमावदेषां अप्रामाण्यमापतितम्।तथा,वर्णा अर्थप्रतिपादकमात्मव्यतिरिक्तमभिव्यञ्जयन्ति, साक्षात् सङ्केतापेक्षत्वात्,अङ्कविष्णुप्रतिमादिवत्।स्फोटः तत्सङ्केतं न साक्षादपेक्षते इत्यवादिष्म ॥

 

तस्मादेवम् अनेकयुक्तिपरिवारप्रत्युपानीतबलाधानं कः स्फोटम् अपाकर्तुं शक्नोति ॥

 

That which is not in need of convention that is authority, like a sentence, a lamp, etc., and other similar objects. Letters are not like that and similar to an image their absence of authority is deduced. Similarly, letters cause the manifestation of something other than themselves which reveal the meaning, as they are directly in need of 

convention just as numbers, images, etc., whereas we would say that ‘sphoṭa' is not in need directly of convention.

 

Thus, who is capable of rejecting sphota which has been greatly strengthened by bringing together a collection of logical arguments[^231].

[^231]: "This seems to be the conclusion and it appears that sphota has been accepted in a sense."

 

तदेवं गते भाष्यमिदानीमुच्यते—तस्य पदस्य सङ्केतबुद्धितः प्रविभागः।शब्दार्थज्ञानव्यतिभिन्नरूपा हि सङ्केतबुद्धिः।तस्याः सकाशात् पदस्य प्रविभागः करणीयः ॥

When it is so the following commentary is now given: "tasya. . gaḥ", i.e., the idea brought about by convention is of a form different from word, meaning and the idea it conveys. Therefore one has to separate the word from its proximity[^232].

[^232]: "Convention and its difference from the threefold division of a word."

 

He indicates the form of convention (through the words) "etā . . . vācakaḥ”, i.e., “etāvatām” = these letters[^159].This is like saying this number is hundred, thousand (and) this image is Viṣṇu.

 

“saśketa. tmā[^234]”,⁴

[^234]: "The Vivaranakāra has “ smrtyātmā” whereas available readings have "

i.e., (convention is of the nature of memory) and it is an authority (testimony ). Just as in the instance — This image is Visnu, He is indeed fourarmed; thus there are two ideas, both these are ideas-in this manner there is a mutual superimposition of the ideas of Viṣṇu and the image on each other.

 

So also "yo'yam · jñānam[^235]".

[^235]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything at all to this bhāṣya as explanation."

 

"ya sarvajñaḥ[^51]”⁶

(He who knows separately) the word, its meaning and the idea (knowledge) (he is all knowing ). How is that? Because it is not possible to know separately (these three). One who is not all knowing cannot know them separately.

"sarva ratīti[^237]". For what purpose is this stated? In this context it is the desire to indicate the means of understanding the sounds of all living beings. The sounds of living beings are the object of the meaning of sentences and it is not the meaning of words (that is its object).[^238]Bare words are like bare letters without meaning as there is absence of collective operation. Just as letters by depending on other letters are useful in revealing the word, in a similar manner, words also depending on other words are the means for bringing into existence sentences. As such only sentences have validity since the use of bare words do not convey the (desired) meaning.

[^237]: "There is nothing by way of explaining this line by the Vivaraṇakāra."

[^238]: "Sounds of these beings convey meaning through sentences, thus that is the intended meaning and not word meanings."

 

Moreover, bare words do not have validity as there is no certainty (of knowledge) from them, similar to single letters[^239]. Nor is a word the denoter ( of meaning ) as it is dependent on conventional meaning as in the case of numbers like a hundred, etc. Bare nouns and verbs do not convey meanings as they are not used alone like prepositions. Wherever a single word is the desired use there also invariably words like Devadatta ‘is’, Devadatta stays, etc., revolve in the mind (to understand the intended meaning ) — thus there is no proof for the use of bare (words to convey meaning).

[^239]: "The Vivaraṇakāra repeats the same idea with the same imagery so many times—this is uncharacteristic of even a commentator like Vācaspati Miśra leave alone Śankarācārya."

 

In such words as 'pralambate' (hanging down), 'paryāgacchati' (approaching), 'abhyāgacchati' (going near), there is no specific meaning indicated by prepositions or karmapravacanīyas[^240]. Similarly in words like abhimanāyate' (to be full of joy), 'sumanāyate' (to be happy in mind), 'durmanāyate' (to be troubled in mind), etc. it is known that prepositions reveal (the specific meaning ). So also in 'pratiṣṭhate' (stands firm), 'adhīta' ( studied), etc., the prepositions indicate the meaning and do not convey the meaning. "tathā. . asti"[^241].⁵

[^240]: "Karmapravacanīya, are also prepositions which convey meanings when not connected with verbs and govern nouns with specific cases like ā paritoṣāt viduṣām, japamanu prāvarṣat. Cf. V.S. Apte, Sanskrit-English Dictionary, p. 340."

[^241]: "Instead of “yathā. ."

Similarly, just by the bare use of action there is understanding of some means, or substance or quality.

Moreover, since there are numerous instances of lack of consistency (in meaning) of roots and affixes, there is irregularity and so they do not denote meaning. Thus from the word 'daridrātiḥ' some only understand the substance (poverty); but the word 'daridra' occurs again as a particle and a preposition in 'drāti' ( to sleep), 'nidrati' (to fall asleep), 'daridrāti' ( to be poor ). In such instances which is the base (basic part) of the word; is it 'drā' or is it 'daridrā'. Some understand it as 'daridrā'; the word ‘drā' is remembered separately as well.

 

In this state some consider the word (daridrā) as one base (with form ). Some consider ‘vi' as the affix and then bring in the base as 'āgama'. Some read along with the base the affix 'vi' and then drop the base. In case one has to mention which is the base, it cannot be determined (by itself). In the limitation of its being the basic word or the affix, it is possible to differentiate the meanings of the base and the affix.

 

In such words as 'asaṅgrāmayata śūra' the preposition has become a part of the main base (word). Similarly who will call such words as 'ataternaḥ', 'aḥ' ‘asyāpatyamiḥ', ‘iyān’, ‘adhunā', as conveying (basically) the meaning of words when there is the absence of the base words. (So also) who will call the words 'agnicit, somasut, bhida, cchidā, atho, kati, amā, paca, patha' as conveying (basically) the meaning of the affix when there is the absence of the affix.

 

In all such cases of the base words and affixes which have strayed away from the indicated (meanings) who is capable of imagining their meaningfulness.

 

It cannot be said that let this be so here; that is not the case elsewhere[^242].You cannot have half an old person[^243].Going to the furthest limit of uddalakapuṣpabhañjikā[^244] is not gathering of flowers'—

[^242]: "All words are not like this says the opponent."

[^244]: "A game where uddālaka flowers are broken or crushed. Cf. Apte, op. cit. p. 272."

in this example what is the meaning of the first and the last words? In examples like 'prajñah, samjña', etc., when followed by ‘nāsti' what is the meaning of what[^245] — these do not convey any real meaning.").

 So also in words like ‘ṛṣabha, vṛṣabha, vṛṣaḥ, udakam, udakuṃbhaḥ, kṣĪrodaḥ, yāva, yavakaḥ, kūpaḥ, sūpaḥ, yūpaḥone has to mention what word has what meaning[^246].And in words like 'dadhyaśāna, madhvatra', etc., what denotes the limit and what the word[^247].

[^246]: "These are mainly clusters of synonyms and the question is in what way does one exactly distinguish their meanings."

[^247]: "The entire discussion is pedantic, serves no purpose and is not in the least philosophical. It is more like a logician or a grammarian trying to show off his skills. This is most uncharacteristic of Śaṅkara's style."

 Therefore letters, base words, affixes and words which have no meaning are seen to have faults and are only the means of sentences without parts which are seen to have no faults. Those ( sentences ) not being joined in (grammatical) conjunction, having no parts, are to be analysed separately from the sentence coloured by false letters, word and sound.

 They which are the wholes (without parts) of the sentences, being the means, appear as if they are the parts of the sentence, are false like the numbers hundred, etc., not having an existence (independently) till the result (comes into being); (they) serve the purpose of revealing the meaning of the sentence which is not being uttered by coming together as means, being accepted (and) set aside they, as the essence of a sentence, appear to have a sequence coloured by time-difference, due to disappearing after accomplishing one's own order of sequence; they appear to come into being, they appear to go out of existence, they appear to be long, they appear to be in time, they appear to have divisions (and) they bring about varied forms ( ideas ).

 As such when mention is made of a hard horn being drawn out of a hare's horn, what is it but a lie; or, as mirage water, though false, is drawn out of the presence of salty soil; or as a man is ( drawn out of ) a pillar and a pillar out of a man, (as) silver is drawn out of mother of pearl; and just as mirage water, etc., are the causes for knowledge of existence of substances such as salty soil, etc., similarly letters, words, base words and affixes help in drawing out the meaning, when there is present the causes for understanding the meaning of a sentence. 

 

a Sometimes the meaning is drawn out as in the case of the mirage (deer running after imaginary water);[^248]sometimes it is desired that a certain purpose (be achieved) as when the number hundred, etc., is drawn out from the numbers hundred, etc., or when the letters of the alphabet depending on convention, taking on the form of a sequence, are drawn out from the letters 'a' and so on. And thus all these become the means for obtaining the existent meaning. So it is not that these are not false to that extent. So also are the words, etc.

[^248]: "Some meaning is understood and an idea is formed."

He who considers the base word, affix, word and letters (denoting meaning) through convention and other means as well which are like the illusory letters of the alphabet (denoting meaning) through their convention as being the means for gaining the meaning of a sentence—thus functioning through creating many (means) and believing them to be true, he is like one who, desiring to see the moon in the cloud, attributes moon-ness to the cloud also, which serves as the means for viewing the moon.

 

Just as the sentence alone is real so also there is reality only to the meaning of a sentence and words or the meanings of words alone do not obtain reality. Every substance has an universal property and a particular property. The particular cannot be separated from the universal nor can the universal be separated from the particular. When one utters the word 'gauḥ' one understands the verb 'exists' Thus even when a word alone is uttered the meaning of the word that is lying underneath indicates the meaning of the sentence itself and not just the meaning of the word.

As such the following meaning is not accepted by us. When there is doubt in each word singly the meaning is reached by all words.

Together they give rise to surety like the crow sitting on the top of a pillar[^249].

[^249]: "'Ślokavārttika,Vakyādhikaraṇa, śloka 363."

 

The word pillar does not convey the meaning of the sentence[^250]nor is it known to have that meaning as a word. For being a tree, being a pillar, being the top, being a crow on top of the pillar—thus the idea of a crow sitting on top of a pillar is not got by understanding the intended idea depending on the different positioning of the words[^251].Even though there is present in them the cause to give rise to something existent, there has to definitely be something that creates the idea of something existent.

[^250]: "The sentence under discussion being 'sthānumūrdhasthakākavat'"

[^251]: "The arrangement being pillar-positioned-on-top-crow and the idea cannot be got definitely of a crow sitting on top of the pillar from the words alone."

 

Therefore the (above) verse has to be read like this: When there is doubt in each word, the meaning is reached by the sentence; as together (as a sentence) it creates a definiteness like in the case of the crow on top of a pillar.

 

Similarly:

 

Therefore, the meaning of a sentence is expressed only by a sentence as it cannot be formed by others; and there is the idea of existence at the end; as the idea of the property of a tree (is created) by the word tree.

 

यत्तु—पलाशशब्देन वृक्षता नोच्यते इति, सत्यमेवमेतत्। न हि पलाशवाक्येन वृक्षवाक्यार्थस्याभिधानम्। भिन्नविषयत्वात्। अन्यो हि पलाशवाक्यार्थः पलाशोऽस्ति तिष्ठतीति वा। अन्यो वृक्षवाक्यार्थः।यदा च पदवर्णानां निरवयवानां पृथगस्तित्वमभ्युपगम्यते, तदा निरवयववर्णपदोपादानं वाक्यं सावयवं कथमवकल्पेत। न हि क्रियाकाशादिभिः सावयवं शक्यमारब्धुम्।अथ सावयवत्वमभ्युपायिष्यते, तत्रापि दोष एव प्रसज्येत॥

 

Question— If it is said that the idea of 'treeness' is not expressed by the word 'palāśa'then the (answer is) it is true.

 

By the use of 'palāśa[^252]' in a sentence there is no indication of meaning of tree in a sentence; as the subject-matter is different.

[^252]: "Name of a tree so not tree."

 

The meaning of the sentence using ‘palāśa' can be 'the palāśa is' or 'the palāśa stands' The meaning of the sentence using 'vṛkṣa' is different. When words and letters having no parts are accepted as existing separately, then how can one imagine a sentence as having parts which uses letters and words without parts[^253]. It is not possible to create parts through action and space, etc. If then there will be acceptance of having parts (in a sentence) even so, there will be the contingency of (some) defect[^254].

[^253]: "The property of the parts has to affect the property of the whole."

[^254]: "This entire discussion and diversions are totally out of place and do not help in understanding the topic. One cannot even imagine Śaṅkara writing this style and also indulging in unnecessary verbiage."

The difference that exists between word and letters which is like the minutest atom is absent everywhere; thus this is only something to frighten the child with[^255].

[^255]: "In truth it does not exist like a scare crow. This is a verse from Ślokavārttikka, Vākyādhikarana, Śloka 150."

 

Since one accepts the property of sattva, etc., of the minutest atom, we mention it clearly after analysing it as-that is something to frighten the old with.

 

Question—

When there is the use of just a word, as one includes other words as well, what is the purpose served by using many words?

 

Answer—

“niyama. nām”[^256]²i.e., when there is mention of action (a deed) there is the rule that all the means to achieve the result are present. Caitra the agent, through the instrument of fire, has rice as the object (of cooking).[^257]

[^256]: "Available readings have an additional "

[^257]: "This is an instance of the use of one word to convey the meaning of many words."

 

Moreover the translation is done only in order to specify the meaning, "dṛṣṭam and so on. Thus "śrotri . . .te", i.e., the bare word 'śrotriya' only denotes the instrument and in the words 'cchando . . . adhite' there is both the action and the means of action. Similarly in “jīvati[^1].⁴ "the word denoting action is special, being a means to draw out a particular action. 'He studies the Vedas, He lives' (got the breath of life),— in this sentence there is manifestation of the meaning that 'the brāhmaṇa lives'. In all ways, in all words there is the capacity of (meaning of ) a sentence – this acceptance of the meaning of other words (in a single word) is what all words are[^259].⁵

[^259]: "This is a grammarian's view. How is it relevant here?"

2\. Available readings have an additional "tathāca pacatītyukte sarvakārakāṇāmākṣepaḥ niyamā whereas the Vivaraṇakāra does not mention it.

4 In available readings there is the word "padaracanam" instead of "padam" The Vivaraṇakāra does not add any explanation to the bhāṣya.

5\. Available readings have "tatra" after "dharayati” which the Vivaraṇa does not have. There is "iti" instead of "tatra"

इति कारकार्थः। क्रियाकारकत्वाद्वस्तुनः श्वेतते श्वेत इति च क्रियार्थेन च कारकार्थेन चाभिधानम् ॥

 

Therefore, sometimes the purpose is accomplished by use of the verbal form alone. Sometimes the action is denoted (implied) by the use of a nominal form itself[^260].

[^260]: "Because every word has both implied."

"tataḥ.. vā", i.e., therefore, from the sentence (the word is to be separated and analysed) as to whether it is a (verb ) like 'lives', etc., or it is a (noun) like a brāhmaṇa, a kṣatriya, etc.

 

"anyathā priyeta”, i.e., if it is not separated from the sentence then (one cannot use a word as noun or verb because of similarity[^261] )In the sentence 'bhavati nidhehi' (the word bhavati) can be either a pronoun or the locative case of the present participle form of 'bhavat'. And it can be a verb in the sense of 'there is sprout from seed'

[^261]: "The Vivaraṇakāra adds nothing new to the bhāṣya here. ."

 

(The word aśva ) in the horse grazes' denotes the universal. In the sentence 'aśvastvam grāmam' (you went to the village) it is the second person singular of the aorist of the root 'śu'. In ‘ajāpayaḥpīyatām' (please drink the goat's milk) (the word ajāpayaḥ) is a noun. In 'ajāpayastvam rājānam' (you caused the king to win) it is the causal, second person singular form of the imperfect of the root 'ji'

 

"teṣām[^262] "after indicating the confusion (between word, meaning and affixes) he shows (their distinction through the words) “śvetate rthaḥ", "śvetaḥrthaḥ[^830]"⁴.As the word has the force of both an action and a noun it is used in the sense of a verb as ‘shines white' and in the sense of a noun as 'white' .

[^262]: "Available readings have “pravibhāgaḥ"

यथा शब्दः क्रियाकारकात्मा, यः श्वेतः स श्वेतते यः श्वेतते स श्वेतः इत्येवं क्रियाकारकाव्यतिरिक्तः एकः शब्दः, तथा अर्थः तद्वाच्यः क्रियाकारकात्मा। तथा तद्विषयः प्रत्ययः क्रियाकारकात्मा। तथा अर्थः शब्दप्रत्ययात्मा। प्रत्ययोऽपि शब्दार्थात्मा। कस्मात् ? सोऽयमित्यभिसम्बन्धात्। योऽर्थः स शब्दः, यः शब्दः सोऽर्थः प्रत्ययश्च, यः प्रत्ययः सोऽर्थः शब्दश्च, इत्येवं अभेदाकारप्रत्ययः स्मृत्यात्मा सङ्केतः इति।एवं सङ्कररूपतः प्रविभागः कार्यः॥

Thus a word “kriyā. tmā” (is both a verb and a noun in essence ) like that which is white shines white'; ‘that which shines white is white', thus a single word is not different from a verb and a noun and its meaning thus indicates that meaning which is (of the essence of a verb and a noun). How is that so? "so'yam. . āt", i.e., that which is the meaning is the word; that which is the word is both the meaning as well as the presented idea; that which is the presented idea is the meaning and the word also; in 

4\. "Available readings have an additional "śabdaḥ" after "kārakārthaḥ"

this way "abheda ... saṅketaḥ[^263]" (convention) is of the essence, memory. In this manner the division is to be made on the nature of confusion.

[^263]: "Available readings have “ekākāra eva” whereas the Vivaranakāra has “abhedākāra"

 

How is this to be done? "yastu . . . bhūtaḥ”, i.e., the meaning of the quality white is that it is (objects like the ) palace, etc., ( it supports ) both the meaning (white quality) and the object (having the quality). "sa . . .. gataḥ" (that undergoes change like) new, old, etc., (and does not correspond to the word or the idea); that (the meaning ) is present even in the absence of the idea and the word; “evam bhāgaḥ[^264]”²,i.e., (in this way the presented idea) does not accompany the word nor does it accompany the meaning; since it exists in the absence of the other. So does the (word) also exist in the absence of meaning and the presented idea; thus the meaning is different, the word is different and the presented idea is different this is the division. "evam dyate", i.e., when samyama is practised on this which is of the nature of a sentence being manifested by conventional letters by dividing it as 'this is the meaning and this is the idea' there is the direct perception in their own form of the divided word, its meaning and its presented idea (in the mind); (then the yogi acquires knowledge of sounds of all living beings).

[^264]: "Available readings have “ vibhāgaḥ” instead of “pravibhāgaḥ” whereas the Vivarana has “vibhāgaḥ” The order in available readings is "

By bringing into direct perception the subliminal-impressions there is knowledge of the earlier births.

These subliminal-impressions are indeed of two kinds (1) those called ‘vāsanā' ( latent impressions) which cause memory and the afflictions and (2) those in the form of virtue and vice which cause fruition (of deeds). Those are formed in previous births and they are the unseen qualities (characteristics) of the mind like mutation, effort, power of restraint, life and dharma.

 

Saṃyama practised on them brings about the direct perception of the subliminal-impressions. And their perception is not possible without the experience of space, time and cause. Thus, in this way, by direct perception of the subliminal-impressions the yogin gets knowledge of previous births. In a similar way, by the direct percep-

tion of the subliminal-impressions of others there is knowledge of the (previous) births of others.

 

In this connection one hears this story**—**

Due to direct perception of the sublimi-nal-impressions in ten cycles of creation Jaigīṣavya, experiencing the sequence of births and deaths (in those cycles), attained knowledge born of discriminate-discernment. Then Bhagavān Āvatya, having assumed a bodily form, told him — You have lived through ten cycles of creation and with a 'sattva' (pure) mind not overpowered (by ‘rajas' and ‘tamas') you have experienced pain in hell and in animal bodies. Being born again and again amongst gods and human beings what have you perceived to be more — pleasure or pain?

 

भगवन्तमावट्यं जैगीषव्य उवाच – दशसु महासर्गेषु भव्यत्वात् अनभिभूतबुद्धिसत्वेन मया नरकतिर्यग्गमनं अनुपश्यता देवमनुष्येषु पुनः पुनः उत्पद्यमानेन यत्किञ्चिदनुभूतंः तत् सर्वं दुःखमेव प्रत्यवैमि ॥

Jaigīṣavya told Āvatya**—**

Having lived through ten cycles of creation with a sattva (pure) mind not overpowered (by rajas and tamas) I have experienced pain of hell and animal life. I consider whatever I have experienced by my birth repeatedly amongst gods and men as pain only Bhagavān āvaṭya said — O Long Lived One, is your mastery over pradhāna (prakṛti, matter) and your supreme joy of contentment also included under pain ?

 

Bhagavān Jaigīṣavya said**—**

It is only with reference to sense-pleasures that this is called supreme joy of contentment; with reference to the bliss of absolute freedom it is only pain. This is a characteristic of the sattva intelligence and is composed of the three guṇas. Moreover, that cognition composed of the three guṇas is placed under (the category of) (pain) which is to be avoided. The chain of greed (desire) is of the form of pain. But when the anguish of the pain of desire is removed there is this contentment said to be calm, undisturbed, all-embracing.

"dvaye . . . samarthaḥ[^265]"¹ = (the twofold latent impressions) are [seen](http://3 "Seen figuratively in the form of experiences in the world which includes memory.") and unseen which are the causes of memory and afflictions. The seen cause experience of affliction, action (deed) (and) result; “citta ... rūpāḥ”, i.e., they are the causes of dharma and adharma, “pūrva tāḥ” = they have been brought about during endless, past lives. "parināmadrstāḥ" = they are described earlier (as unseen). “samyamaḥsamarthaḥ” = one who practises (saṃyama) on those two subliminal-impressions (becomes adept at direct perception of the subliminal-impressions).

[^265]: "Available readings have “vāsanārūpaḥ"

 And as they (the impressions) are produced, qualified by experience of space, time and cause, so even at the time of direct perception they are perceived qualified by qualities of space, etc. Therefore "na ca... karaṇam[^266]".

 In order to make clear the result of direct perception of subliminal-impressions he narrates the following story: "bhaga. . idamuktam[^268] ")" (Cognition composed of three guṇas is placed under the category of pain). Depending on what does this twofold (pain) be considered pleasure —he answers that (through the words) “duḥkha. uktam[^159]",i.e., pleasure (joy) of contentment and joy of victory over pradhāna.

(By practising samyama) on ideas there arises knowledge of other people's minds.

By practising saṃyama on ideas (notions) there is direct perception of the ideas; then (there follows) knowledge of other minds.

**प्रत्ययस्य परचित्तज्ञानम्। परप्रत्यये संयमात् परप्रत्ययस्य साक्षात्करणम्। तत्साक्षात्करणे तत्संबन्धिनः परचित्तस्य ज्ञानं भवति ॥१९॥**

[^270]: "'Available readings have "

[^271]: "'The Vivaraṇakāra does not explain this line."

न च सालम्बनं तस्याविषयीभूतत्वात् ॥२०॥

The above knowledge is not along with its object (basis) since that is not the object of the yogī's mind.

**रक्तं प्रत्ययं जानाति। अमुष्मिन् आलम्बने रक्त इति न जानाति।परप्रत्ययस्य यदालम्बनं तत् योगिचित्तेन न आलम्बनीकृतम्।परप्रत्ययमात्रं तु योगिचित्तस्य आलम्बनीभूतम् इति ॥२०॥**

He comes to know the feeling (idea) of attachment but does not know that it is attached to such and such an object. This is because the object on which another's mind has formed its idea has not become an object for the mind of the yogi. The mind of the yogīhas only the idea in another mind as the basis (for samyama).

तत्र परप्रत्ययसाक्षात्करणात् तद्दुःखे दुःखित्वं, तत्सुखे सुखित्वं च प्राप्नोतीत्याशङ्क्याह—न च सालम्बनं तस्य अविषयीभूतत्वात्। रक्तं प्रत्ययं जानाति योगी। परस्य अमुष्मिन् आलम्बने रक्तः प्रत्यय इति न जानाति । परप्रत्ययस्य यदालम्बनं सुखरूपं दुःखरूपं वा, येन सुखी दुःखी वा भवेत् ॥

In that direct perception of another's idea does one obtain pain in another's pain, (or) pleasure— in another's pleasure-having this doubt he says *na ca tvāt[^272]*."raktam jānāti", i.e., the yogi (knows the idea of attachment but he does not know) the other's idea (as attached to such and such a support ). "para lambanam" (the support) may be of the form of pleasure or of the form of pain through which one is either happy or sad.

[^272]: "The sūtra available reads na ca tat sālaṃbanam. . but the Vivaraṇa reading is na ca sālaṃbanam."

Objection—But then, if he does not know the support how will he know that he is attached to such and such ( an object).

Answer—He (yogī) knows in a general way that he (the other ) is attached to such 

1.'Available readings have "... sākṣātkaraṇāt tataḥ..." while the Vivaraṇakāra has tataḥ."  
sākṣātkaraṇam

and such (an object); but his support is not the special pleasure which is dependent on the idea of one who is happy.

कायरूपसंयमात्तद्ग्राह्यशक्तिस्तम्भे चक्षुष्प्रकाशासंप्रयोगेऽन्तर्धानम् ॥२१॥

By practising samyama on the (outer) form of the body, when its power to be known (seen) is stopped (and), there being no contact with the light of the eye, there is disappearance (of the yogī's body).

**कायस्य रूपे संयमाद् रूपस्य या ग्राह्या शक्तिस्तां प्रतिबध्नाति। ग्राह्यशक्तिस्तम्भे सति चक्षुःप्रकाशासंप्रयोगेऽन्तर्धानमुत्पद्यते योगिनः। एतेन शब्दाद्यन्तर्धानमुक्तं वेदितव्यम् ॥२१॥**

By practising saṃyama on the (outer) form of the body there is stoppage of the power to be known (seen) of the body. When the power to be known (seen) is stopped, there is absence of contact with the light which carries it to the eye (of the observer). (Then) the disappearance of the yogī is effected. (Similarly), by this (example), the disappearance of sound &c., must be understood as explained.

कायरूपसंयमात् तद्ग्राह्यशक्तिस्तम्भे चक्षुः प्रकाशारराम्प्रयोगे अन्तर्धानम्। योगिन आत्मीयस्य कायस्य रूपं कायरूपम्। तस्मिन् रूपे संयमात् तस्य रूपस्य या परचक्षुर्ग्राह्या शक्तिः तां प्रतिबध्नाति निरुणद्धि।ततः परेषां चक्षुः प्रकाशो योगिकायरूपेण न सम्प्रयुज्यते।ततश्च अन्तर्धानम्।एतेन शब्दाद्यन्तर्धानमुक्तम्।योगिशब्दस्य या ग्राह्यशक्तिः तस्यां संयमे सति या शब्दस्य ग्राह्यशक्तिः सा प्रतिष्टभ्यते।तेन योगिशब्दं न परः शृणोति। तथा स्पर्शादिष्वपि द्रष्टव्यम् ॥२१॥

**

*kāyarūpa-dhānam*. “kāyasya . . . māt", i.e., the form of the body of the yogīwhich belongs to himself is (kāyarūpam); when (saṃyama is practised on it) “rūpasya. badhnāti[^273]''' there is stoppage of that (power) of that form (being seen) by another's eyes. As a result the light of the eye of others is not connected with the body of the yogi. Consequently there is (disappearance). "etena . . . uktam", i.e., when samyama is practised on the power to be grasped which the sound of the yogi has, then that power to be grasped of sound is stopped. Due to that another cannot hear the sound (words) of the yogī. Similarly, one should understand (saṃyama practised on) touch, etc.

[^273]: "The reading available is “... tām pratiṣṭabhnāti” whereas the Vivaranakāra has tām pratibadhnati”"

सोपक्रमं निरुपक्रमं च कर्म तत्संयमादपरान्तज्ञानमरिष्टेभ्यो वा ॥२२॥

Karma (deeds) is either fast in fruition or slow in fruition; by practising samyama on them or on portents (of death) there is knowledge of death.

आयुर्विपाकं कर्म द्विधा –सोपक्रमं निरुपक्रमं च।तत्र यथाऽऽर्द्रं वस्त्रं वितानितं क्षेपीयसा कालेन शुष्येत् तथा सोपक्रमम्।यथा च तदेव संपिण्डितं चिरेण संशुष्येदेवं निरुपक्रमम्।यथा वा अग्निः शुष्के कक्षे युक्तवाते समन्ततो नियुक्तः क्षेपीयसा कालेन दहेत् तथा सोपक्रमम्।यथा वा स एवाग्निस्तृणराशौ क्रमेण न्यस्तश्चिरेण दहेत् तथा निरुपक्रमम्।तदैकभविकमायुष्करं कर्म द्विविधम्— सोपक्रमं निरुपक्रमं च। तत्संयमादपरान्तस्य प्रायणस्य ज्ञानम्।

** **

Karma (deeds) which gives rise to the fruit of length of life (span of life) is of two kinds – (1) that which fructifies fast or (2) that which fructifies slowly.

** **

Just as a wet cloth spread out dries quickly so also is the deed which fructifies fast. Or just as that (cloth) itself kept in a lump takes long to dry so also is the deed which fructifies slowly. Or just as fire in a dry place, fanned by breeze, spreads all around and burns (the grass ) in a short time so also is the deed which fructifies fast. Or, just as that same fire placed gradually in a heap of grass burns (the grass) slowly, so also is the deed that fructifies slowly.

** **

Karma which has its existence in one life (and) which has caused the span of life (life period) is thus of two kinds – (1) that which is fast in fruition and (2) that which is slow in fruition. By practising saṃyama on them there arises knowledge of end of this life.

 (The same knowledge ) arises from ( various ) portents ( of death). Portents are of three kinds—(1) Those pertaining to one's self. (2) Those pertaining to (other) living (beings) things. (3) Those pertaining to divine beings. Those (signs) pertaining to one's self are (1) Not hearing any sound within one's body when the ears are closed or (2) Not seeing any (inner) light when the eyes are closed.

** **

Similarly those (signs) pertaining to (other) living things are – (1) seeing the mes- sengers of Yama or (2) knowing (seeing ) unexpectedly one's dead ancestors. Similarly those (signs) pertaining to divine beings are (1) seeing unexpectedly the siddhas, etc., or (2) seeing everything contrary to what he has been seeing during his whole life. By these (signs) also (the yogi) knows that his death is close at hand.

** **

*sopakramam*. vā. "āyur dhā[^1]".1 Why is this so? That which yields results by taking its cause quickly is called "sopakramam"

** **

And that which yields results in a long time, spread out slowly that is "nirupa-kramam"

** **

"yathā . . . śuṣyet",[^51]2i.e., (a wet cloth) spread out (dries) soon (so also) the deed (that fructifies fast) dwindles soon yielding its result of span of life. "tadeva. pakramam" = that same cloth (in a lump), not spread out (dries slowly, so also that which fructifies slowly) makes the life span long.

** **

"yathā pakramam[^1]"3, i.e., when there is helpful breeze (fire in a dry place spreads all around and burns fast so also) deeds (that fructify fast) burns up in a short time, the span of life[^277].

[^277]: "These appear as reasons for a short or long life."

** **

"sa evā. . kramam",[^1]5 i.e., that deed (is slow in fruition).[^279]

[^279]: "Nothing has been added to the bhāṣya explanation except the word karma."

** **

"tadetat. .karma[^280]”7 “tat. . jñānam", i.e., (there is knowledge of) one's own (death). Similarly by (practising) samyama on the two kinds of deeds of others there is knowledge of the death of others[^281].

[^280]: "The Vivaraṇakara does not add anything to the bhāṣya, which is in a different order. Thus instead of "

[^281]: "Time of death of the others."

** **

The purpose of knowing (the time of) death is the desire towards fulfilling one's own duty as a person[^282].

[^282]: "One can fulfil one's duty towards another person before his death and one's own duties as well. But the question that arises is will a yogī, in such an advanced state, have that kind of concerns, towards himself."

** **

"ariṣṭe. " (or) there is knowledge of death (from omens). "trivi ca"[^159].He mentions the example pertaining to oneself as "ghoṣam paśyati[^159]".

** **

"tathā . . . sarvam[^169]".

** **

"viparītam. .", i.e., he sees and does (everything) contrary (to what was done earlier[^286]).In that context, the word 'ariṣṭa' (portent, omen) is the popular worldly use. Thus it is said—'I had this (bad) omen of seeing things contrary (to experience).

[^286]: "The yogi is treated almost like an ordinary person here."

1\. Available readings have "... dvividham" instead of "... dvidhā" The Vivaraṇakāra also does not explain it.  
2. Instead of ".. laghīyasā kālena śuṣyet" the Vivaraṇakāra has ". . kṣepīyasā kālena śuṣyet" The Vivaraṇakāra also does not give his own comment but supplements the bhāṣya with some words and completes the sense.  
3. Available readings have "... kakṣe mukto vātena samantato yuktaḥ. " instead of " kakṣe yuktavāte samantato niyuktaḥ...".  
 Here also the Vivaraṇakāra just completes the sense using words from the bhāṣya without his own commentary.  
5. Available readings have ".tṛṇarāśau kramaśo'vayaveṣu"whereas the Vivarana has "... tṛṇarāśau krameṇa..".  
7. The Vivaraṇakara does not add anything to the bhāṣya, which is in a different order. Thus instead of "tadaikabhavikamayuṣkaram karma dvividham" the Vivaraṇakāra has "tadetat dvividham aikabhavikamayuṣkaram karma". Only "etat" has been added to the bhāṣya.

मैत्र्यादिषु बलानि ॥२३॥

** **

By practising samyama on friendliness &c., (the yogī) acquires strength (in them).

** **

**मैत्री करुणा मुदितेति तिस्रो भावनाः।तत्र भूतेषु सुखितेषु मैत्रीं भावयित्वा मैत्रीबलं लभते।दुःखितेषु करुणां भावयित्वा करुणाबलं लभते।पुण्यशीलेषु मुदितां भावयित्वा मुदिताबलं लभते।भावनातः समाधिर्यः स संयमः, ततो बलान्यवन्ध्यवीर्याणि जायन्ते।पापशीलेषूपेक्षा न तु भावना।ततश्च तस्यां नास्ति समाधिरित्यतो न बलमुपेक्षातः, तत्र संयमाभावादिति ॥२३॥**

** **

Friendliness, compassion and joy are three feelings. By feeling friendliness towards living beings who are happy one acquires the strength of friendliness. By feeling compassion towards those who are in pain, one acquires the strength of compas- sion. By feeling joy towards the virtuous, one acquires the strength of joy. From these feelings there arises 'samādhi' ( in them) which is 'saṃyama' From it there arise powers which are of unfailing energy.

** **

Towards the sinful there is indifference which is not a continuous feeling. There- fore there is no samādhi in indifference and hence no strength arises from indifference, since there is absence of samyama therein.

** **

**मैत्र्यादिषु बलानि।मैत्री करुणा मुदितेति तिस्रो भावनाः।तत्र भूतेषु सुखितेषु मैत्रीं भावयित्वा मैत्रीबलं लभते।दुःखितेषु करुणां भावयित्वा करूणाबलं लभते।पुण्यशीलेषु मुदितां भावयित्वा मुदिताबलं लभते ॥**

** 

*maitryādisu balāni. “*maitrī labhate[^287]". “bhāvanātaḥ" = (the samādhi) that arises by meditating on (feelings of) friendliness, etc., (that saṃyama) is the cause for steadiness in meditation on friendliness, etc. “tataḥ” = from samyama based on friendliness etc., “balā yante[^288]"(powers of unfailing energy arise).

By practising samyama upon a strength(s) (the yogi) acquires the strength of an elephant, etc.

 

हस्तिबले संयमाद् हस्तिबलो भवति।वैनतेयबले संयमाद्वैनतेयबलो भवति।वायुबले संयमाद्वायुबलो भवतीत्येवमादि ॥ २४ ॥ 

3\. "The Vivaraṇakāra adds words to the bhāṣya which are not therein the given bhāṣya. Thus instead of "pāpaśīleṣūpekṣā na tu bhāvanā" he has "pāpaśileșu tu asya upekṣā na tu bhāvanā" The Vivaraṇakāra also does not add anything to the bhāṣya explanation.

** **

By practising saṃyama on the strength of an elephant (the yogī) acquires the strength of an elephant. By practising saṃyama on the strength of Vainateya (Garuḍa) (the yogī) acquires the strength of Garuḍa By practising saṃyama on the strength (power) of wind one acquires the strength of wind. In the same way, saṃyama on other pow- ers (gives such powers).

The explanation of these worlds are (as follows ): There are seven worlds. Amongst them (1) Starting with Avīci and extending up to the summit of Meru mountain is the region of bhūh (earth) (2) Starting with the summit of Meru up to the pole star is the 

intermediate region adorned with planets, asterisms (and) stars. Beyond that is the fivefold region of svaḥ (heaven). (3) The third (region) is the abode of Indra. (4) The fourth (region) is the region of mahaḥ, the abode of prajāpatis. The threefold region of Brahmā are (5) the Janaloka ( 6 ) the Tapoloka, and ( 7 ) the Satyaloka. (All these regions are mentioned in the following) summarised verse: 'The world of Brahmā has three regions, then (there is ) the wide (region) of the prajāpatis (then comes) the world of Indra; these (five) are called svaḥ(heaven); in the skies there are the stars (and) on the earth creatures'

Then placed in ascending order from the Avici there are six regions of the great hell supported by solid matter, by water, by fire, by wind, by space and by darkness respectively. (They are called) Mahākāla, Aṃbarīṣa Raurava, Mahāraurava, Kālasūtra, and Andhatāmisra respectively. Experiencing the pain accumulated by their sinful deeds, living creatures, taking on a long and miserable span of life are born herein. Then ( there are ) the seven nether regions Mahātala, Rasātala, Atala, Sutala, Vitala, Talātala (and) Pātāla.

This earth is the eighth called Vasumatī with its seven dvīpas and with the golden Sumeru mountain in the centre. Its peaks are made of silver, of emerald, of crystal, of gold and of gems. Here, because of the reflection of the lustre of lapis lazuli (emerald) the southern quarter of the sky is deep blue like the leaf of a blue lotus. The eastern (quarter) is white, the western ( quarter) is clear, the northern (quarter) is like the golden amaranth (yellow).

On its (Meru's) right side is the Jambu tree from which it is called the Jambudvīpa. Due to the movement of the sun (round Meru) it appears that night and day are attached to it.

** **

There are three mountains on its north having blue and white peaks and extending for two thousand yojanas. Or there are three mountains on its north called the 'nīla', 'Śveta' and 'sṛṅgavān' extending to two thousand yojanas Surrounded by these mountains are the three continents, nine thousand yojanas each, called Ramaṇaka, Hiraṇmaya and the Northern Kurus.

** **

To the south are the mountains Niṣadha, Hemakūṭa and Himaśaila extending for two thousand yojanas. Surrounded by these are the three continents, nine thousand yojanas each called Harivarṣa, Kimpuruṣa and Bhārata.

** **

The eastern regions of Sumeru are bounded by Bhadrāśva and Mālyavat (and) the western regions are bounded by Ketumāla and Gandhamādana. In the middle is the continent of Ilāvṛta. The (Jambudvīpa) of hundred thousand yojanas stretches in each direction for half this distance from Sumeru. This same Jambudvīpa extending for hundred thousand yojanas is surrounded by a girdle-shaped salt ocean twice its extent.

** **

Then there are the dvīpas Śāka, Kuśa, Krauñca, Śālmala, Gomedha, and Puṣkara each twice as large as the preceding one. So also there are the oceans looking like a pile of mustard seeds, adorned with beautiful hills. (These dvīpas) are surrounded by girdle-shaped seven oceans which taste as sugarcane juice, wine, ghee, curd, milk and gruel. (They are) encircled by the Lokāloka mountain which measures up to fifty crores of yojanas in extent.

All this is well arranged in the middle of the well-founded (world) Egg. And the Egg itself is like a glow worm in the sky, a small fragment of pradhāna (primary cause).

Here in the nether worlds (pātāla), in the ocean, in these mountains are the abode of gods, asuras, gandharvas, kinnaras, kiṃpuruṣas, yakṣas, rākṣasas, bhūtas, pretas, piśācas, apasmārakas, apsaras, brahmarākṣasas, kūṣmāṇḍas, and-vināyakas live here. In all the dvīpas live men and gods who are good. The Sumeru mountain is the pleasure grounds of the gods. The gardens there are Miśravana, Nandana, Caitraratha and Sumānasa. Sudharma is the assembly hall of the gods; Sudarśana is (their) city; Vaijayanta their palace. Fixed to the pole star, the planets, asterisms and stars situated above the Sumeru mountain revolve in the sky, regulated by the steady movement of the wind.

 

माहेन्द्रनिवासिनः षड् दैवनिकायाः– त्रिदशा अग्निष्वात्ता याम्यास्तुषिता अपरिनिर्मितवशवर्तिनः परिनिर्मितवशवर्तिनश्चेति। सर्वे संकल्पसिद्धा अणिमाद्यैश्वर्यापपन्नाः कल्पायुषो वृन्दारकाः कामभोगिन औपपादिकदेहा उत्तमानुकूलाभिरप्सरोभिः कृतपरिवाराः।

 The inhabitants of the world of Mahendra are the six classes of devas (divine beings). They are Tridaśas, Agniṣvāttas, Yāmyas, Tuṣitas, Aparinirmitavaśavartins, and Parinirmitavaśavartins. They are capable of fulfilling their desires by mere thought; they have powers like atomisation &c., they live for a (whole) kalpa; they are good; they enjoy (delight in) love; they have bodies which have come into existence without parents; they are served by good and amenable apsaras.

 In the great world of the prājāpatyas live five classes of gods; they are—Kumudas, Ṛbhavas, Pratardanas, Añjanābhas, and Pracitābhas. They have mastery over the gross elements (mahābhūtas), they have meditation as their food; they live for a thousand kalpas.

 प्रथमे ब्रह्मणो जनलोके चतुर्विधो देवनिकायः – ब्रह्मपुरोहिता ब्रह्मकायिका ब्रह्ममहाकायिका अजरामरा इति। एते भूतेन्द्रियवशिनो द्विगुणद्विगुणोत्तरायुषः।

 In Janaloka, the first of the worlds of Brahmā live the four classes of gods. They are Brahmapurohitas, Brahmakāyikas, Brahmamahākāyikas, and Ajarêmaras. They have control over the elements and the sense-organs. Each class (of gods) lives twice as long as the preceding one.

  In Tapoloka, the second world (of Brahmā) live three classes of gods. They are- Ābhāsvaras, Mahābhāsvaras, and Satyamahābhāsvaras. They have control over the elements, the sense organs and the primary cause (prakrti); each class lives twice as long as the preceding one; all have meditation as their food; they are chaste (ūrdhvaretas); their knowledge is not obstructed in the upper regions; there is nothing which is obscure to thought in the lower regions.

 तृतीये ब्रह्मणः सत्यलोके चत्वारो देवनिकायाः – अच्युताः शुद्धनिवासाः सत्याभाः संज्ञासंज्ञिनश्चेति। ते चाकृतभवनन्यासाः स्वप्रतिष्ठा उपर्युपरिस्थिताः प्रधानवशिनो यावत्सर्गीयुषः। तत्राच्युताः सवितर्कध्यानसुखाः, शुद्धनिवासाः सविचारध्यानसुखाः सत्याभा आनन्दमात्रध्यानसुखाः, संज्ञासंज्ञिनश्चास्मितामात्रध्यानसुखाः। तेऽपि त्रैलोक्यमध्ये प्रतिष्ठन्ति ॥

 In Satyaloka, the third world of Brahmā, live four classes of gods. They are Acyuta, Śuddhanivāsa, Satyābhā, and Saṃjñasaṃjñins. They have made no habitations; they are established in themselves: they live one above the other; they have control of the primary cause; they live as long as there are creations. Among them the Acyutas delight in meditation accompanied by deliberation, the Suddhanivāsas delight in meditation accompanied by reflection; the Satyābhās delight in meditation accompanied by bliss alone and the Saṃjñasamjñins delight in meditation accompanied by the ‘sense of I' alone. They also live within the three worlds.

 त एते सप्त लोकाः सर्व एव ब्रह्मलोकाः। विदेहप्रकृतिलयास्तु मोक्षपदे वर्तन्त इति न लोकमध्ये

न्यस्ता इति। एतद्योगिना साक्षात्करणीयं सूर्यद्वारे संयमं कृत्वा ततोऽन्यत्रापि। एवं तावदभ्यसेद्यावदिदं सर्वं दृष्टमिति ॥२६॥

 These are the seven regions (and) they are all the worlds of Brahmā. Whereas the videhas and the prakṛtilayas, being in the state of (quasi) liberation are not placed in the ( different) worlds (regions).

 All this is to be brought into direct perception by the yogīby practising saṃyama on the solar opening; then on other (similar) objects as well. He should continue this (saṃyama) till all this becomes clear.

 भुवनज्ञानं सूर्ये संयमात्। सूर्ये संयमं कृत्वा समस्तं भुवनप्रस्तारं प्रत्यक्षीकुर्वीत। भाष्ये तु गतार्थं, सर्वपुराणप्रसिद्धत्वात् ॥२६॥

* bhuvana māt,* by practising saṃyama on the sun (the yogī) can directly perceive the entire worldly expanse. The commentary is familiar as it is well-known in all the Purāṇas.[^292]

[^292]: "This is interesting and shows a disinclination of the Vivaraṇakāra to comment on this tedious purāṇic passage. On the other hand all the other commentators though familiar with the Purāṇa commentaries did comment on the passage."

चन्द्रे ताराव्यूहज्ञानम् ॥२७॥

 By practising 'saṃyama' on the moon there is knowledge of the arrangement of stars.

  चन्द्रे संयमं कृत्वा ताराणां व्यूहं विजानीयात् ॥२७॥

By practising 'saṃyama' on the moon one can obtain knowledge of the arrangement of stars.

 चन्द्रे ताराव्यूहज्ञानम्। सूर्ये संयमनाद्भुवनप्रस्तारं विदित्वा, तदनन्तरं चन्द्रे संयमं कृत्वा ताराणां व्यूहं विजानीयात्। सूर्यसंयमाद्भुवनप्रस्तारमात्रं प्रज्ञातम् – एवं प्रस्तीर्णाः लोका नद्यः समुद्रा गिरयश्चेति। न तु तारा इत्थं व्यूहिता अनेन सम्बद्धा इति। चन्द्रसंयमात्तु ताराव्यूहप्रकारावगतिरिति ॥२७॥

 *candre-jñānam*, i.e., by practising saṃyama on the sun and after knowing the worldly expanse as a next step, *candre* practising saṃyama on the moon (the yogī) can know the collection of stars. By saṃyama on the sun, only the worldly expanse was known—i.e., in this way the worlds, rivers, oceans, mountains, etc., are spread. But not about the stars being arranged in such and such a manner and connected in this manner. But by saṃyama on the moon there is knowledge regarding the nature and arrangement of the stars.

ध्रुवे तद्गतिज्ञानम् ॥२८॥

 By practising 'saṃyama' on the pole star there is knowledge of their movements.

 ततो ध्रुवे संयमं कृत्वा ताराणां गतिं विजानीयात्। ऊर्ध्वविमानेषु कृतसंयमस्तानि विजानीयात् ॥२८॥

 Then by practising 'saṃyama' on the pole star one can obtain knowledge of the movement of stars. By practising saṃyama on the heavenly chariots (ūrdhvavimāna) one obtains knowledge pertaining to them.

 ध्रुवे तद्गतिज्ञानम्। ततश्च समनन्तरं ध्रुवे संयमं कृत्वा ताराणां गतिं विजानीयात्— अनेन प्रकारेण सञ्चरमाणा अनेन विशिष्टा इति। अस्मिन् कालेऽनेन ग्रहेण अयं ग्रहो विरुध्यते, इत्थमस्तमयः। इत्थमुदयः, तद्द्वारेण प्राणभृतां शुभमशुभं चेत्यादि विजानीयात् ॥

एवमन्येषु चोर्ध्वं विमानेषु संयमं कृत्वा तानि विमानानीत्थंप्रकाराण्येवंगतानीत्येवमादि सर्वं विजानीयात् ॥२८॥

 *dhruve .nam.* “tataśca” = and after that (saṃyama on the moon) (by saṃyama on the pole star he gains knowledge of movement of stars) i.e., “dhruve yāt" = moving in this manner it is qualified in such a way. At this time, this planet is opposed by such and such a planet, in this way there is the setting (of one) and the rising (of another). Through that there will be knowledge of what is good or bad for living beings.[^293]

[^293]: "This is an explicit reference to astrology. It is difficult to believe that Śaṅkara would subscribe to this belief."

 In this manner "cordhvam... yāt"[^294] (the yogī) (can know) all manner of things like the chariots are of these kinds (and) they move in such a way, etc.

[^294]: "The Vivaraṇakāra splits the bhāṣya and states it in his own way. Thus instead of “ūrdhvavimăneșu kṛtasaṃyamastāni..."

नाभिचक्रे कायव्यूहज्ञानम् ॥२९॥

 By practising saṃyama on the 'navel-wheel' (nābhicakra) there is knowledge of the body arrangement.

 नाभिचक्रं संयमं कृत्वा कायव्यूहं विजानीयात्। वातपित्तलेष्माणस्त्रयो दोषाः। धातवः सप्त त्वग्लोहितमांसास्थिमेदोमज्जाशुक्राणि। पूर्वं पूर्वमेषां बाह्यमित्येष विन्यासः ॥२९॥

  By practising saṃyama on the 'navel-wheel' one gains knowledge of the 'body arrangement' The three humours ( in the body) are gas, bile and phlegm. The seven substances (of the body) are skin, blood, flesh, bone, fat, marrow, and semen. The arrangement (of the above seven) is such that the one preceding is exterior to the one coming after it.

 नाभिचक्रे कायव्यूहज्ञानम्। नाभिचक्रे संयमं कृत्वा कायव्यूहं विजानीयात्। वातपित्तश्लेष्माणस्त्रयो दोषाः एतावत्प्रमाणा एतत्प्रतिष्ठा इत्यादि ज्ञेयम् ॥

 तथा धातवः सप्त बाह्याभ्यन्तरभावेनावस्थिताः। (रसः) त्वक् बाह्या सर्वेषाम्। ततोऽभ्यन्तरं लोहितं, ततो मांसं, ततोऽस्थि, ततो मेदः, ततो मज्जा, ततः शुलं सर्वाभ्यन्तरमित्येवं पूर्वं पूर्वमेषां बाह्यम् इत्येष विन्यासः। तथा नाडीनां च व्यूहं विजानीयात् ॥२९॥

*  nābhi . . . jñānam.* “nābhi . . . doṣāḥ”, i.e., (the three humours) such as their respective proportions (in the body) and their ( specific) support is known.

 "dhātavaḥ . . .= similarly (with reference to) (the seven substances) that have internal and external existence (in the body ). The skin is external to everything else;

2\. 'The Vivaraṇakāra splits the bhāṣya and states it in his own way. Thus instead of “ūrdhvavimāneṣu kṛtasamyamastāni..." the Vivarana has "cordhvam vimāneṣu saṃyamam kṛtvā tāni

next is the internal (blood), then (flesh), then (bone), then (fat), then (marrow), then (semen) which is internal to everything-thus "pūrvam .. saḥ"[^295] (is the arrangement). Similarly, the arrangement of the nerves can be known.

[^295]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything new to the bhāṣya."

कण्ठकूपे क्षुत्पिपासानिवृत्तिः ॥३०॥

 By practising 'saṃyama' on the pit of the throat there is the cessation of hunger and thirst.

 जिह्वाया अधस्तात्तन्तुः। तन्तोऽधस्तात्कण्ठः। ततोऽधस्तात्कूपः। तत्र संयमात्क्षुत्पिपासे न प्रतिबाधेते ॥३०॥

 Below the tongue is the cord ( tantu); below that is the throat; below that is the pit (gullet); by practising 'saṃyama' on that region, hunger and thirst do not torment one.

 कण्ठकूपे क्षुत्पिपासानिवृत्तिः। जिह्वाया अधस्तात्तन्तुः उन्नामिकायां जिह्वायां दृश्यते। तन्तोरधस्तात् कण्ठः। ततोऽधस्तात् कूपः। तत्र संयमात्क्षुत्पिपासे न प्रतिबाधते ॥३०॥

 *kaṇtha vṛttiḥ. “jihvā* . . .ntuḥ" (the cord below the tongue) is seen in the prokantha truding tongue. "tanto . . bādhete"[^1]

कूर्मनाड्यां स्थैर्यम् ॥३१॥

 By practising ‘saṃyama' on the tortoise - nerve (tube ) there is steadiness (of the mind).

  कूपस्याधस्तात् उरसि कूर्मानाम नाडी। तस्यां कृतसंयमः स्थिरपदं लभते। यथा सर्पा गोधा चेति ॥३१॥

  Below the pit (of the throat) there is, in the chest, a (tube) nerve (nāḍī) called a tortoise. By practising 'saṃyama' on it one attains steadiness (of the mind) like the (steadiness of the) snake or of a guana (alligator).

 कूर्मनाड्यां स्थैर्यम्। कूपस्याधस्तादुरसि कूर्मा नाम नाडी। तस्यां कृतसंयमः स्थिरपदं लभते चित्तस्थैर्यं लभते। यथा सर्पों गोधा वा धारणादुरसा अत्यन्तं स्थिरीभवति ॥३१॥

 *kūrma. ryam.* “kūpa .. nādī[^297]";“tasyām labhate" = one attains stability of mind (by practising saṃyama on the kūrmanāḍī). (This is like) “yathā. vā” (that of a snake or guana) when held by the chest there is absolute steadiness, (no movement whatsoever).

[^297]: "Available readings have “kūpādadha. kūrmākārā nāḍī"

मूर्धज्योतिषि सिद्धदर्शनम् ॥३२॥

  By practising ‘saṃyama' on the lustre in the skull (head) there is vision of the siddhas (perfected souls).

2. Available readings have ". bādhete" whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has" pratibādhete" The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything to the bhāṣya.  
3. Available readings have "kūpādadha.. kūrmākārā nāḍī" whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has "kūpasyādhastāt.. kūrmā nāma nāḍi"

 शिरः कपालेरन्तश्छिद्रं प्रभास्वरं ज्योतिः, तत्र संयमं कृत्वा सिद्धानां द्यावापृथिव्योरन्तरालचारिणां दर्शनम् ॥३२॥

 In the skull there is an opening (hole) of the nature of radiant light. By practising saṃyama on that region, one gets a vision of siddhas who move in space between the earth and the sky.

 मूर्धज्योतिषि सिद्धदर्शनम्। शिरः कपालेऽन्तश्छिद्रं प्रभास्वरत्वात् ज्योतिः इत्युच्यते। तत्र संयमात् सिद्धानां द्यावापृथिव्योरन्तरालचारिणां दर्शनं भवति ॥३२॥

 *mūrdha . nam.* “śira . . darśanam”, i.e., (there is an opening in the skull), as it is luminous it is called (radiant light). By practising saṃyama on it there is “dyāvā . darśanam" (vision of siddhas moving between earth and sky ).

प्रातिभाद्वा सर्वम् ॥३३॥

 Or through 'prātibha' comes knowledge of everything.

 प्रातिभ नाम तारकम्, तद्विवेकजस्य ज्ञानस्य पूर्वरूपम्, यथोदये प्रभा भास्करस्य। तस्मात् वा सर्वमेव विजानन्ति योगिनः प्रातिभस्य ज्ञानस्योत्पादादिति ॥३३॥

 ‘Prātibha' is also called 'tāraka'. It is a state of knowing (knowledge ) prior to the dawn of discriminate-discernment, just as the light of dawn before the rising of the sun. Through that also, i.e., when 'prātibha' knowledge arises, the yogīs come to know everything.

 प्रातिभाद्वा सर्वम्। आत्मनि संयमं कुर्वतः, ईश्वरं वा अत्यर्थं प्रणिदधानस्य योगिनः प्रातिभं तारकं स्वयमुत्थितं मानसं ज्ञानम्, तत् वक्ष्यमाणलक्षणस्य विवेकजस्य ज्ञानस्य पूर्वरूपम्। यथा उदये प्रभा औषसी किंचिदुन्मीलन्ती लोहितायमाना भास्करस्य उज्जिगमिषतः पूर्वरूपम्। तस्मादा सर्वं विजानन्ति योगिनः प्रातिभस्य ज्ञानस्योत्पादादिति ॥३३॥

 *"prāti . . . sarvam.* By (practising) saṃyama on oneself or by extreme devotion to Īśvara "prātibham" there arises by itself mental knowledge[^298]which is of the nature being mentioned (as) "viveka. . rūpam[^299]"."yathā . . . rasya" (just as the light) of dawn reveals slightly the redness (of the sun) so also this is the early form of (knowledge of the yogī) who desires to excel (in saṃyama). "tasmād. pādāditi[^51]".³

[^298]: "Knowledge belonging to the mind."

[^299]: "This is its nature and the Vivaraṇakāra just leaves the bhāṣya to speak for itself."

हृदये चित्तसंवित् ॥३४॥

 By practising 'saṃyama' on the heart there is knowledge pertaining to the mind.

 यदिदमस्मिन्ब्रह्मपुरे दहरं पुण्डरीकं वेश्म तत्र विज्ञानं तस्मिन्संयमाच्चित्तसंवित् ॥३४॥

 In this citadel of Brahma, in the lotus-like cavity, is the dwelling place of intelligence (consciousness ). By practising ‘saṃyama' on it there is knowledge ( direct perception) of the mind.

3\. 'Instead of "tena vā sarvameva jānāti yogī... utpattāviti" the Vivaraṇakāra has “tasmādvā sarvam vijänanti yoginaḥ utpādāditi"

 हृदये चित्तसंवित्। यदिदमस्मिन् ब्रह्मपुरे शरीरे दहरम् अल्पं पुण्डरीकं पुण्डरीकाकारो मांसपिण्डोऽधोमुखः, वेश्मवदनेकनाडीसुषिरयोगात् वेश्म। तत्र विज्ञानं चित्तं, तस्मिन् उरस्सरोविलग्ननाले प्राणवेश्मनि पुण्डरीके संयमाच्चित्ते सत्त्वे संवित् भवति ॥३४॥

 *hṛdaye vit*. "yadi veśma” “brahmapure" = in the body; “daharam" = small; “puṇḍarikam” = an inverted lump of flesh in the shape of a lotus. “veśma” = it is like a house because of connection with many hollow tubes. "tatra. cittam[^301]''' (therein is intelligence, the mind); "tasmin saṃvit" by saṃyama on the stalk attached to the lotus chest which is the dwelling place of prāṇa (vital breath), there is (knowledge ) pertaining to the sattva mind (intelligence).

[^301]: "There is no "

 सत्त्वपुरुषयोरत्यन्तासंकीर्णयोः प्रत्ययाविशेषो भोगः परार्थात् स्वार्थसंयमात्पुरुषज्ञानम् ॥३५॥

  Since it serves the purpose of another, experience (of pleasure or pain) is a feeling of identity between the sattva-intellect and the puruṣa which are quite distinct from each other. By practising 'saṃyama' on that which exists for itself (serves its own purpose) there arises the knowledge of the self.

1 'There is no "cittam" in available readings.

 बुद्धिसत्त्वं प्रख्याशीलं समानसत्त्वोपनिबन्धने रजस्तमसी वशीकृत्य सत्त्वपुरुषान्यताप्रत्ययेन परिणतम्। तस्माच्च सत्त्वात्परिणामिनोऽत्यन्तविधर्मा शुद्धोऽन्यश्चिन्मात्ररूपः पुरुषः। तयोरत्यन्तासंकीर्णयोः प्रत्ययाविशेषो भोगः पुरुषस्य, दर्शितविषयत्वात्।

 When the sattva-intellect which has the nature of brightness overpowers rajas and tamas which are equally dependent upon sattva, it changes into the notion of a distinction between puruṣa and the sattva-intellect. The puruṣa is entirely different from that sattva (intellect) which changes. (He is) pure, distinct (from sattva) and of the nature of absolute consciousness. Experience is a feeling of identity between these two which are quite distinct from each other because the objects are shown (to the self).

 स भोगप्रत्ययः सत्त्वस्य परार्थत्वाद् दृश्यः। यस्तु तस्माद्विशिष्टश्चितिमात्ररूपोऽन्यः पौरुषेयः प्रत्ययस्तत्र संयमात्पुरुषविषया प्रज्ञा जायते। न च पुरुषप्रत्ययेन बुद्धिसत्त्वात्मना पुरुषो दृश्यते, पुरुष एव तं प्रत्ययं स्वालम्बनं पश्यति। तथा ह्युक्तम्—विज्ञातारमरे केन विजानीयात् इति ॥३५॥

 The notion of experience is (something) knowable because the sattva-intellect exists for another (i.e., puruṣa). Whereas there is another idea, the idea of the puruṣa which is different from this (i.e., experience) and which is of the nature of pure consciousness. By practising 'saṃyama' on that there arises 'prajñā' which has puruṣa as its object.

 Puruṣa is not known through the sattva-intellect which has the idea of puruṣa. But puruṣa himself realises that notion (idea) which has himself as its support. Thus it is said in the Upaniṣad: 'By whom is the knower to be known'

 *sattva. .jñānam. sattvam* = the mind, *puruṣah* = experiencer, tayoratyanta and so on. *pratyayāviśeṣah* = similarity of form with the modification ( of the mind) of these two, “*atyantāsaṃ*= which are absolutely different is *bhogaḥ* = experience of puruṣa. "*parārthāt"* = when one distinguishes the sattva-intellect which serves another and which appears confused as the knowledge of puruṣa and “svārthe . bhavati" by (saṃyama) svārthe = on its true nature as bare consciousness, ( there is realisation of puruṣa)

 Question—In what way does that sattva-intellect serve the purpose of another? Because of what does one distinguish (it and) practise saṃyama on puruṣa that serves its own end.

 Answer—"buddhi.. tam", i.e., (the intellect) is in general sattva, the effect of the substance (prakṛti); in order to accomplish the purpose of puruṣa it exists together with, i.e., is bound to the two. “samāna. natam" = (and) subduing (rajas and tamas) (there is the notion of difference between the sattva intellect and puruṣa) in the yogī's (mind).

 "tasmā . . puruṣaḥ[^302]”¹,' i.e., (puruṣa) which is changeless, existing for its own sake, permanent (is totally different) from (sattva) which is made of three guṇas, impermanent, impure, existing for the sake of another (and) insentient.

[^302]: "Instead of “. . . śuddho'nyaścinmātrarūpah. "

 tayora.. pratyayaḥ[^303]"; when (puruṣa) is changeless there can be no experience (of puruṣa) which is different from the object being shown to (puruṣa[^304]). "sattva dṛśyah” = there is non-distinction of the idea of experience by puruṣa (due to reflection).

[^303]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not explain this line and leaves the bhāṣya as it is."

[^304]: "Cf. YS, I.3 and bhāṣya under it."

 "yastu . pratyayaḥ", i.e., (there is another idea of the self of the nature of bare consciousness) different from this subsidiary idea and from the knower of that idea[^305]. "tatra..jāyate[^306]".

[^305]: "The knower who knows the idea of sattva by reflection."

[^306]: "The Vivaraṇakāra leaves the bhāṣya to explain itself."

1\.

'Instead of "... śuddho' nyaścinmatrarūpah. "in available readings the Vivaraṇa has " viśuddho'-nyascinmātrarūpaḥ

 Objection— But then, if puruṣa objectifies the idea[^307] and if puruṣa is grasped by that then puruṣa has the purpose of another[^308].

[^307]: "The sattva intellect being its object by reflection."

[^308]: "So there will be no difference from the sattva intellect."

 Answer — There is no defect in this. “na ca. tvā” (puruṣa is not seen) by the sattva nature of the intellect having the idea of puruṣa as object as the intellect is of an insentient nature.

 पुरुष एव तं प्रत्ययं स्वालम्बनं पुरुषाभासं पश्यति पुरुषाभासत्वमेव प्रत्ययस्य पुरुषालम्बनत्वम्। न प्रत्ययस्य पुरुषालम्बनत्वम्। यथा मुखसन्निधौ दर्पणो मुखाकारेण परिणमते, तथा चित्तं पुरुषाकारेण परिणतं पुरुषाभासं पुरुषेण गृह्यते॥

 तथा चोक्तम्– “विज्ञातारमरे केन विजानीयात्” इति। न कस्यचित् पुरुषः कर्मतां प्रतिपद्यत इत्यर्थः॥

 ननु चक्षुरादर्शतलप्रतिहतं प्रतिनिवृत्य यथा मुखस्य ग्राहकं, एवं पुरुषोऽपि चित्तसत्त्वप्रतिहतः प्रतिनिवृत्य स्वात्मानं गृह्णीयात् — न— परिणामानुपपत्तेः पुरुषस्य। न ह्यपरिणामिनश्चित्तं प्रति प्रवृत्तिः प्रतिनिवृत्तिर्वा साधिमानमुपाश्नुवीत॥

 न चापि चक्षुः प्रतिनिवृत्य मुखं ग्राहयति। मुखस्य दर्पणमण्डलाधिकरणत्वेन अनुभूयमानत्वात्। न हि स्वमुखं दर्पणाधिकरणस्थम्। किं च, आदर्शानुविधानाच्च। यथा खड्गे दीर्घं मुखं दृश्यते। न स्वमुखं दीर्घम्। प्रतिहतेन चेदुपलभ्येत चक्षुषा निजमुखं, तत्र आदर्शानुविधानमयुक्तम्॥३५॥

 “puruṣa . . śyati[^309]”³( puruṣa knows) that idea which is an appearance of puruṣa — puruṣa being the support of the idea is only the appearance of puruṣa; there is no support of the idea as puruṣa[^310]. Just as in the presence of the face (in front of a mirror) the mirror takes on the form of the face, similarly the mind (intellect) changed into the form of puruṣa by the reflection of puruṣa, grasps the puruṣa.

[^309]: "Available readings have svātmāvalambanam paśyati"

[^310]: "One has to distinguish purușa as an object of knowledge and the reflection or appearance of puruṣa as an idea."

 "tathā. iti[^311]”⁵,i.e, no puruṣa attains the position of an object.

[^311]: "Available readings have “tathā hyuktam"

 Objection—But then, just as the eye captures inversely the face which has been sent back from the surface of the mirror so also puruṣa grasps its own self inversely which has been sent back from the sattva intellect.

 Answer — That is not so— as change in puruṣa does not fit. That which is change- less has no activity or inverse activity with reference to the mind (intellect) through which to attain some achievement.

 Nor does the eye capture the face by turning back (inversely ), as there is experience of the face as having the surface of the mirror as support, and not as if one's own face is situated in the mirror as support.

 Moreover, in keeping with the nature of a mirror[^312] (that is not true); similarly, in sword the face is seen as long' but one's own face is not long[^313]; if one's own face is seen by the eye due to its being sent back it is not logical to see it conforming to the nature of the mirror[^314].

[^312]: "One's own face is not supported by the mirror because of the way a mirror is made and the way the face is also made."

[^313]: "The reflection on the surface of a sword."

[^314]: "The experience has the location defined by the mirror."

ततः प्रातिभश्रावणवेदनादर्शास्वादवार्ता जायन्ते ॥३६॥

 From that arise prātibha ( vividness), śrāvaņa ( supernormal power of hearing), vedanā (supernormal power of touch), ādarśa (supernormal power of vision), āsvāda (supernormal power of taste) and vārtā (supernormal power of smell).

 Due to 'prātibha' there is knowledge of the subtle, the obstructed, the remote the past and the future. Due to śrāvaṇa one hears divine sounds; due to 'vedanā' there is access to divine touch; due to ādarśa there is knowledge of divine colour (shape); due to 'āsvāda' there is knowledge of divine taste; due to vārtā' he gains knowledge in the form of the principle of correct behaviour; thus these (powers) invariably arise (at this stage).

 *tatah jāyante. tataḥ*= by saṃyama on one's self, “prātibha. = from mental (intuitive) knowledge arising out of saṃyama on one's self; "sūkṣma. . jñānam" = there is (knowledge of the subtle. .)[^315] ; “śrāva. śrāvaṇam”[^316];“vedanāt” = by tactile awareness (there is knowledge of the touch of siddhas, etc.) “ādarśāt" = through knowledge of the sense of vision there is (awareness of) divine form (colour); “āsvādāt" = through knowledge of the sense of taste there is (awareness of divine taste). "vārtam" is that which arises from worldly activity, i.e., knowledge of behaviour in the world[^317];³ from that this “saṃvya . cchati[^318]".

 *te samā siddhayaḥ*. “te . . siddhayaḥ[^319]"i.e., (these arising out of ‘pratibhā. in one, in a state of samādhi) in the self are obstacles as they obstruct vision of puruṣa. “vyutthi. .ddhayaḥ" Though they rise due to saṃyama on (in) puruṣa still they do not happen in the case of the samādhi-mind that is completely detached[^320].

[^319]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not explain the bhāṣya except to add a line at the end."

[^320]: "If the mind is totally detached then these will not be able to obstruct the yogi from the final goal."

बन्धकारणशैथिल्यात्प्रचारसंवेदनाच्च चित्तस्य परशरीरावेशः ॥३८॥

 Due to the loosening (slackening) of the cause of bondage and due to knowledge of the working of the mind, the mind can enter into another's body.

 लोलीभूतस्य मनसोऽप्रतिष्ठस्य शरीरे कर्माशयाद् बन्धः प्रतिष्ठेत्यर्थः। तस्य कर्मणो बन्धकारणस्य शैथिल्यं समाधिबलाद्भवति। प्रचारसंवेदनं च चित्तस्य समाधिजमेव, कर्मबन्धक्षयात्स्वचित्तप्रचारसंवेदनाच्च योगी चित्तं स्वशरीरान्निष्कृष्य शरीरान्तरेषु निक्षिपति। निक्षिप्तं चित्तं चेन्द्रियाण्यनुपतन्ति। यथा मधुकरराजानं मक्षिका उत्पतन्तमनुत्पतन्ति निविशमानमनुनिविशन्ते, तथेन्द्रियाणि परशरीरावेशे चित्तमनुविधीयन्त इति॥३८॥

 The mind which is by nature restless and (therefore) unstable comes to stay or is bound in the body due to the (deeds) deposit of the subliminal-impressions of 'karma' The loosening ( slackening) of that 'karma' which is the cause of bondage comes about by the power of 'samādhi' And the knowledge of the workings of the mind arises only on account of 'samādhi'

 By the dwindling of the bondage of karma and by the knowledge of the workings of one's own mind the yogī, by removing the mind-stuff from his own body, places it in other bodies. And the sense-organs follow the mind which is thus placed. Just as the bees follow the king (queen) of bees when it flies up and settles down, similarly the sense-organs follow the mind when it enters the body of another.

उदानजयाज्जलपङ्ककण्टकादिष्वसङ्ग उत्क्रान्तिश्च ॥३९॥

  By conquering the (prāṇa) called 'udāna' there is non-contact with water, or mud or thorns or similar objects and there is upward flight (at death).

  Action of all the senses characterised by the prāṇas &c. (vital forces ) is life. Its action is fivefold. Prāṇa moves through the mouth and nose and manifests itself upto the region of the heart. Samāna manifests itself upto the region of the navel; it is so called because it distributes (food) equally (to all parts of the body ). Apāna manifests itself upto the region of the soles of the feet; it is so-called because it carries away (the waste of the body). Udāna manifests itself upto the region of the head; it is so-called because it carries upward (the juices of the body). Vyāna is so-called because it is spread all over ( the body ). Of these prāṇa is the most important.

 By conquering 'udāna' there is non-contact with water or mud or thorns or similar objects and at the time of death there is upward flight. By control over (udāna) that is achieved.

"tasya . kriya[^1]"2, i.e., due to the rule of accomplishing the purpose of puruṣa of this living (entity) it spreads by division into prāṇa, apāna, vyāna, udāna (and) samāna.

Here, as it is subsidiary to the conquering of the mind, there is no separate mention of the means to conquer them. By mastery over prāṇāyāma (the others) are mastered. The means to their mastery has not been mentioned separately but only the result of victory over udāna is mentioned (as follows):

[^331]: "Could this be the Hathayogapradīpikā attributed to Hiraṇyagarbha? Then this could push the date further of the author of the Vivaraṇa."

 "udāna . asaṅgaḥ" (by mastery over udāna there is non-contact with water) and so on, and with the tip of a sword, etc. Moreover, "utkrān vati"."tām dyate[^1]"8," i.e., (that) upward movement which takes place (at the time of death) takes place by one's own free will by mastering udāna[^333].

श्रोत्राकाशयोः संबन्धसंयमाद्दिव्यं श्रोत्रम् ॥४१॥

 By practising saṃyama on the relationship between ākāśa and the organ of hearing there is (gained ) a divine sense of hearing.

 सर्वश्रोत्राणामाकाशं प्रतिष्ठा शब्दानां च ।

  Ākāśa is the basis for all organs of hearing and for sounds. Thus it is said—'All those whose (organ of) hearing exists in the same place have the same kind of hearing' And this characteristic of ākāśa is also of the nature of not being covered (by anything else). Thus, because elsewhere a thing with form is seen covered by space it is well-known that ākāśa is all-pervading.

  The power of hearing is inferred from perceiving sound. Between one who is deaf and the other who is not deaf one perceives sound and the other does not perceive sound. Therefore, sound is the object of only the organ of hearing. The yogīwho practises saṃyama on the relationship between ākāśa and the organ-of-hearing gains divine sense (organ) of hearing.

* śrotrā . śrotram.* In answer to the question as to what this relation is on which

saṃyama is to be practised, he (Vyāsa) says: "sarva. . nām[^301]"¹ The support of (words) is ether as ether is their nature. With reference to the sound to be grasped the relationship between the ear and ether is unobstructed.

  "tathā[^1].² ". "tulya[^1] "³, i.e., that through which one hears is "śravaṇa" those which have the same locus of hearing are "tulyadeśaśravaṇāḥ; (they all have the same kind of hearing). That (sound) is connected to the substance (ear) which has no covering (and) which gives space[^337] (for sound);"tacca" (this is the mark) for the existence of ether[^338] is inferred from this.")).

[^337]: "The support of the ear being ether."

[^338]: "Ether (ākāśa

 Similarly "anāva. śasya[^1]"⁶ one sees (obstruction) in the case of objects like pots, etc., which are different from ether[^340]. Therefore, when there is no obstruction inside gems and diamonds there is ether. And that is why (ether is well-known as all-perva- sive).

[^340]: "Which do not have ether as support; which are not the qualities of ether."

 The mark of the organ of hearing is mentioned as "śabda " and so on; i.e., that which is the cause of hearing of one who is not deaf and the reason for not hearing of the other (who is deaf) that is the sense-organ of hearing. "tasmā. vişayam", i.e., (therefore the sense of hearing has sound as object) because one who is deaf does not hear. "śrotrā . vartate[^341]".

[^341]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything new to the bhāṣya explanation."

कायाकाशयोः संबन्धसंयमाल्लघुतूलसमापत्तेश्चाकाशगमनम् ॥४२॥

 By practising saṃyama on the relationship between the body and ākāśa or by 'samāpatti' on lightness such as that of cotton fibre there follows movement in the air (sky).

  यत्र कायस्तत्राकाशं तस्यावकाशदानात्कायस्य, तेन संबन्धः। तत्र कृतसंयमो जित्वा तत्संबन्ध लघुषु वा तूलादिष्वापरमाणुभ्यः समापत्तेः जितसंबन्धो लघुर्भवति। लघुत्वाच्च जले पादाभ्यां विहरति, ततस्तूर्णनाभितन्तुमात्रे विहृत्य रश्मिषु विहरति। ततो यथेष्टमाकाशगतिरस्य भवतीति ॥४२॥

  Wherever there is the body, there is ākāśa since it makes room for it (body); therefore the body has an invariable relationship to it (ākāśa). The yogī who practises saṃyama on that (relationship) conquers that relationship and becomes light. Or, by acquiring oneness (samāpatti) with light (objects) like cotton wool &c., down to atoms (the yogībecomes light). Because of lightness he is able to walk over water with his feet. Next he walks over spider's webs and (later) upon rays of light. Thereafter he moves through the air at will.

1.There is no "ca" after "śabdānām" and there is no "sarva" before "śabdānām" in the Vivarana.

2\. Available readings have "yathoktam" instead of "tathācoktam"  
3. Available readings have" . ekaśrutitvam. "instead of" ekadeśaśrutitvam " in the Vivaraṇa.  
6. Available readings have "anāvaraṇam" instead of "anavaraṇātmakam". Also instead of "tathā'mūrtasyānāvaraṇa. " the Vivaraṇakāra has "tathā mūrtasyānyatrākāśādāvaraṇa.

 *kāyākāśa manam*. “yatra. saṃbandhaḥ[^342]" (as ether makes room for the body) it has the (relationship) of close proximity with (that) ether. "tatra (practising samyama) on that mutual close relationship between ether and the body and (conquering that relationship) the yogī “laghuṣu saṃbandhaḥ[^343]'’acquires lightness like that of cotton wool.

[^342]: "There is an additional “prāptiḥ"

[^343]: "Available readings have samāpattim labdhva jita. "

 Having conquered the relationship between the body and ether, having attained (that) in order to practise the nature of lightness like cotton wool, etc., (he walks over water with his feet). "tataḥ. bhavati", i.e., then he walks up (on spider's webs), then acquiring lightness like that of the flame of a firebrand (he flies upon the rays of the sun ). And then (he flies) in the air.

 (Thus he flies as he wishes in air ).

बहिरकल्पिता वृत्तिर्महाविदेहा ततः प्रकाशावरणक्षयः ॥४३॥

  The unimagined modification of the outer mind (internal organ) is called mahāvidehā. By practising saṃyama on that, there is the removal of the covering of the illumination (of the buddhisattva).

 शरीराद्बहिर्मनसो वृत्तिलाभो विदेहा नाम धारणा। सा यदि शरीरप्रतिष्ठस्य मनसो बहिर्वृत्तिमात्रेण भवति सा कल्पितेत्युच्यते। या तु शरीरनिरपेक्षा बहिर्भूतस्यैव मनसो बहिर्वृत्तिः सा खल्वकल्पिता। तत्र कल्पितया साधयन्त्यकल्पितां महाविदेहामिति, यथा परशरीराण्याविशन्ति योगिनः ततश्च धारणातः प्रकाशात्मनो बुद्धिसत्त्वस्य यदावरणं क्लेशकर्मविपाकत्रयं रजस्तमोमूलं तस्य क्षयो भवति ॥४३॥

 The modification of the mind held outside the body is the concentration called 'videhā' If that is only an outer modification of the mind which abides in the body, it is called 'imagined' If however, that is an outer modification of the mind which is itself external and is unrelated to the body then it is called 'unimagined' Amongst these two the 'mahāvidehā' ( akalpitā) is achieved through the kalpita; by that (kalpitā), yogīs enter the bodies of others.

 As a result of that 'dhāranā' the covering of the bright sattva mind in the form of kleśa (hindrance), karma (deed) and threefold fruition, which has their basis in rajas and tamas, dwindles away.

 बहिरकल्पिता वृत्तिर्महाविदेहा ततः प्रकाशावरणक्षयः। शरीरात् बहिः देशान्तरे विषयविशेषे स्वयमेच समाधिबलात् उपजायते या मनसो वृत्तिः सा महाविदेहा नाम धारणा। सा यदि शरीरप्रतिष्ठस्यैव मनसो

1.There is an additional "praptiḥ" after "saṃbandhaḥ" in available readings which is not there in the Vivaraṇa.  
2. Available readings have " samāpattim labdhvā jita. "instead of "samāpatteḥ jita The Vivaraṇakāra does not explain this portion and leaves the bhāṣya to speak for itself.

 *bahir kṣayaḥ*"śarīrāt dhāraṇā[^1]'¹, 'i.e., ( that modification of the mind that takes place of itself) in another place, in a particular object due to the power of samādhi (that is known as the mahāvidehā-dhāraṇā). “sā yadi. ucyate[^345]"(It is called imagined) at that time (when it is only a modification of the mind abiding in the body with regard to an outside object). This is because it is accompanied by the decision of the mind situated in the body. "yātu .akalpitā, i.e., due to the power of samādhi and due to the loosening of the cause of bondage in the body (there is external modification of the mind without reference to the body as if it is situated outside) that is called (akalpitā, unimagined) while in the imagined the outer modification (of the mind) is limited to the body it is not seen as limited to the body in the unimagined[^346].

[^345]: "Instead of pratişthasya manaso in available readings the Vivaraṇakāra has pratisthasyaiva manaso."

[^346]: "This appears to be a modification which is a power of the mind independent of the body or senseorgans and that is why it is called videhã. There are two kinds, one being just videhã and the other mahāvidehā."

 Both these are outside the body as they are imagined outside. Out of the two this is that which is unimagined called mahāvidehā. “tatra dehām”, i.e., as it is accomplished by training the imagination, the unimagined is achieved through the imagined. “yayā . bhavati[^347]' by that mahāvidehā (yogïs enter other bodies). (Through dhāraṇā) on mahāvidehā (there is dwindling away of the covering of afflictions .).

[^347]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not explain this except to add some words to connect the flow of ideas. He leaves the bhāṣya to speak for itself."

स्थूलस्वरूपसूक्ष्मान्वयार्थवत्त्वसंयमाद्भूतजयः ॥४४॥

 By practising saṃyama on the gross, the essential nature (character ), the subtle, the inherence and the purposefulness, there is mastery over the elements.

 तत्र पार्थिवाः शब्दादयो विशेषाः सहाऽऽकारादिभिर्धर्मैः स्थूलशब्देन परिभाषिताः। एतद्भूतानां प्रथमं रूपम्।

 द्वितीयं रूपं सामान्यं मूर्तिर्भूमिः स्नेहो जलं वह्निरुष्णता वायुः प्रणामित्वं सर्वतोगतिराकाश इत्येतत्स्वरूपशब्देनोच्यते॥

 तस्य सामान्यस्य शब्दादयो विशेषाः। तथा चोक्तम् – एकजातिसमन्वितानामेषां धर्ममात्रव्यावृत्तिरिति ॥

1.

'Available readings have "Sarīrāt... manaso vṛttilābho videhā. " whereas the Vivarana has śarīrāt. manaso yā vṛtti sā videhā. "

 Amongst them earth substances and their characteristics (like) sound &c., (touch, colour, taste, smell) along with their accompanying properties such as shape &c., are called by the word gross. This is the first form of the elements.

 The second form is the generic (general) form (thus) earth has limitation in extent, water has liquidity, fire has heat, wind has mobility, ākāśa has all-pervasiveness; this is technically called the true essence. This generic form has sound &c., as its attributes (particulars).

 Thus it is said—'All these which are connected under one species are distinguished only by their attributes (properties)

 सामान्यविशेषसमुदायोऽत्र द्रव्यम्। द्विष्ठो हि समूहः। प्रत्यस्तमितभेदावयवः शरीरं वृक्षो यूथं वनमिति। शब्देनोपात्तभेदावयवानुगतः समूहः—उभये देवमनुष्याः, समूहस्य देवा एको भागो मनुष्या द्वितीयो भागः। ताभ्यामेवाभिधीयते समूहः। भेदाभेदविवक्षितः। आम्राणां वनं ब्राह्मणानां सङ्घः, आम्रवनं ब्राह्मणसङ्घ इति।

 स पुनर्द्विविधो युतसिद्धावयवोऽयुतसिद्धावयवश्च। युतसिद्धावयवः समूहो वनं सङ्घ इति। अयुतसिद्धावयवः सङ्घातः– शरीरं वृक्षः परमाणुरिति। अयुतसिद्धावयवभेदानुगतः समूहो द्रव्यमिति पतञ्जलिः। एतत्स्वरूपमित्युक्तम्।

 Here a substance is an aggregate of the generic form and the particular. A collection is of two kinds:

 (1) That in which the different parts have lost their identity in the whole such as a body, a tree, a herd, a forest.

 (2) That collection in which the different parts are distinguished by the terms (used) such as— 'the two-gods and human beings'. In this collection the gods are one part and human beings are the second part. The collection is known only by these two.

 Furthermore, the distinction or identity of the parts may be emphasised (in a collection). Thus (we may say) 'a grove of mango trees', ‘a group of brāhmaṇas' (or) ‘a mango-grove', 'a brāhmaṇa-gathering This is again of two kinds—(1) that in which the parts exist separately and (2) that in which the parts are not separable. A forest (or) a group is a collection where the parts exist separately. The body, a tree (or) an atom is a collection where the parts are not separable.

  Patañjali says that a substance is a collection in which the different parts exist without distinction and which cannot be separated. This is called its essential nature.

 अथ किमेषां सूक्ष्मरूपम् ? तन्मात्रं भूतकारणम्। तस्यैकोऽवयवः परमाणुः सामान्य विशेषात्माऽयुतसिद्धावयवभेदानुगतः समुदाय इत्येवं सर्वतन्मात्राण्येतत्तृतीयम्।

 अथ भूतानां चतुर्थं रूपं ख्यातिक्रियास्थितिशीला गुणाः कार्यस्वरूपानुपातिनोऽन्वयशब्देनोक्ताः।

 अथैषां पञ्चमं रूपमर्थवत्त्वम्, भोगापवर्गार्थता गुणेष्वन्वयिनी, गुणस्तन्मात्रभूतभौतिकेष्विति सर्वमर्थवत्। तेष्विदानीं भूतेषु पञ्चसु पञ्चरूपेषु संयमात्तस्य तस्य रूपस्य स्वरूपदर्शनं जयश्च प्रादुर्भवति। तत्र पञ्च भूतस्वरूपाणि जित्वा भूतजयी भवति। तज्जयाद्वत्सानुसारिण्य इव गावोऽस्य सङ्कल्पानुविधायिन्यो भूतप्रकृतयो भवन्ति ॥४४॥

  Now what is the subtle form of these (gross) substances? It is the subtle element which is the cause of the gross element. An atom is one part of it. Its essence is the

generic form and the particular, and it is a collection in which the different parts exist without distinction and which cannot be separated. All tanmātras are like this. This is the third (form).

 The fourth form of the elements are the qualities having the characteristics of knowability, activity and inertia. These conform to the nature of the effects and are described by the word 'inherence'

 The fifth form of these ( elements ) is purposefulness. Having experience and liberation as their purpose is inherent in the guṇas; (and) the guṇas are inherent in the subtle elements (tanmātras), the gross elements (bhūtas) and the material objects. Therefore everything has a purpose.

 Now by practising saṃyama on the five elements having the five forms, one gets an insight into the essence of the form on which samyama is practised and subjugation of (that form) also comes about. By subjugating the five forms of the elements he gains mastery over the elements. Having conquered them, the causes of the elements follow their will just as the cows follow their calves.

 *sthūla . bhūta jayaḥ.* The compound word sthūla (in the sūtra) is grammatically explained as — it is gross, and it has its own nature, and it is subtle, and has inherence and has purposefulness: thus each element is of a fivefold nature[^348].' “tatra[^1]. ", i.e, sound, touch, colour, taste (and) smell ( are the particulars) as earth has the subtle element having five properties as its cause[^350]. "saha. bhiḥ" The (properties of) shape, etc., of earth (are described as) 'shape, weight, roughness, obstruction, stability, existence, divisibility, endurance, littleness, hardness, capacity to be experienced by all' Similarly the watery porperties are 'liquidity, brightness, sub-

[^348]: "It is interesting to observe that both the Vivaraṇa and the Tattvavaiśāradī start their explanations the same way by analysing the compound."

[^350]: "Ether has sound; wind has sound + touch; light has sound + touch + colour; water has sound + touch + colour + taste: earth has sound + touch + colour + taste + smell; this is the process of evolution in the system."

tlety, smoothness, heaviness, protection, clarity, (and) cohesion.' Similarly the fiery qualities are 'Moving upwards, purification, burning, cooking, lightness, (and) shining. Similarly properties of wind are 'Crooked motion, purification, throwing down, strength, (and) pushing'. Similarly the properties of ether are 'Movement everywhere, interpenenetration (and non-obstruction)'

 "ākārā sitāḥ”, i.e., (the word gross element is defined) in the śāstra through these (special characteristics like sound and qualities of shape, etc.) for purposes of worldly activity.

 Similarly the watery (element) is defined through the four special characteristics of taste, etc., along with subtlety, etc., so also the fiery (elements) are defined as gross through the three special characteristics of colour, etc., along with upward movement, etc. Again the special properties of the gross elements of wind are touch and sound and crooked motion, etc. Similarly the gross special qualities of ether are capacity to move everywhere, etc. "etat. . rūpam" this gross form is mentioned as the (first).

 "dvitī." and so on[^1].'¹ = Now is mentioned (the second form). And that (general property) is inherent without division in different substances; like earth having limitation in extent. Similarly in watery substances having taste, etc., the general inherent (characteristic) is "sneha eva jalam[^301]"² (water has liquidity). So also for fiery substances having colour, etc., the general inherent characteristic is "vaḥni[^353]"³ (fire has heat); similarly in windy substances having touch, transverse motion, etc., the inherent general characteristic is (wind has mobility)-"praṇāmitvam[^1] ".⁴

[^353]: "The bhāṣya reading is "

 So also the inherent general characteristic in (ether) having sound, etc., is "sarva. ākāśaḥ[^837]"⁵ (space has all-pervasiveness); “ityetat . . . uktam[^355]"⁶ (thus this) second form (is mentioned as the true essence).

 Even the minutest atoms have parts as sattva, etc[^364].,produce effects, they have extension like pots, etc. "ayuta.. patañjaliḥ[^365]", "etat.. tyuktam" = (the substance) is of the essence of a general and particular nature.

[^364]: "Everything including the atom being composed of the three guṇas in the system."

[^365]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything to the bhāṣya explanation."

 "atha. rūpam"? "tan. .ṇam", etc., as it is begun by many minute atoms "tasya. . māṇuḥ" = the minute atom (is a part) of the subtle element. And that is also "sāmānya. . mātrāṇi[^159]"; the subtle elements from that[^367] existing free from distinctions and its parts, are the minutest atoms (and this) “etat tṛtīyam” is the (third) form of the object of saṃyama of the gross element called subtle. As it is started by the subtle element, ether is with parts and it is non-eternal. It is not possible to have the substance called ether without the quality of sound since there is non-difference between the substance and its attribute[^368].

[^367]: "Every subtle element is composed of the minutest atom having generic and particular properties."

[^368]: "As ether is only inferred from the presence of sound as its substratum."

ननु च केशादीनां कृष्णिमाऽप्यपैति, शुकिमा समुपजायते। तथा च अपायोपजनधर्माणः कृष्णिमादयः ते गुणाः। यत्तु न कृष्णिमानमनु विनश्यति, शुक्लिमानमन्वेति, तत् द्रव्यम्। एवम् आकाशादीनामपि गुणव्यतिरेकेण सद्भावः, शब्दप्रत्ययादिभेदात् इति ॥

 Objection—But then, the blackness of hair vanishes and whiteness comes into place. Thus vanishing and appearing are the qualities (supports) and blackness, etc.. are their properties. That which is not destroyed following that which is black and which accompanies that which is white is the substance. Similarly in the case of ether and so on, there is existence apart from the quality due to the difference from the idea of sound, etc.

 Answer—That is not so; as there is no example available. The same hair(s) that are black are also white; they change into the properties of blackness and whiteness. Everything is in essence everything else[^369]. In the immutable support one does not even get the qualities whiteness and so on, having the nature of disappearing and coming into being. Nor is the nature of the substance revealed by removal of blackness, etc. So also the statement—'that which is experienced by sight and touch is a substance'-— when touch and colour are in an inseparable collection, then the two are known through touch and sight; thus there is no defect[^370].

[^369]: "Cf. bhāṣya under YS, III.14."

[^370]: "Even this definition is not correct strictly, as the substance is known jointly by both its properties."

ननु च न रूपं स्पर्शनेन गृह्यते, नापि दर्शनेन स्पर्शः, यदुभाभ्यां गृह्यते 'यत् पश्यामि तदेव स्पृशामी' ति तद्रव्यम्। यत्तु चक्षुषैव गृह्यते स्पर्शनेनैव च गृह्यते स गुण इति॥

 Objection—But then, shape is not perceived through touch nor is touch perceived through sight; that which is perceived through both as 'that which I see is what I touch' that is the substance.

 That which is perceived only by the eye and only by touch is a quality. Answer—That is not so; a collection which is a mixture of different groups like beans, sesame seeds, barley, etc., has many classes; a collection is something perceived through sight and touch. Moreover, through sight and touch only the qualities are perceived due to the external sense-organs as in the case of the ear. Nor is there the universal without the property as it is not perceived separately.

 Moreover, even in cases like (perceiving ) a pot, etc., by mutual superimposition of both sight and touch, only the colour and touch is perceived; it can also be this colour has a bad smell, it has a good smell, etc. Therefore, ether begun by subtle elements is not capable of being perceived apart from sound; so it is with parts and also noneternal.

 "atha śabdenoktāḥ[^371]" (the fourth form) is what inheres in the qualities of the effect; (it is called as anvaya) since it always follows (the qualities). This fourth form of the elements is the object of samyama called inherence that accompanies the qualities[^372].

[^371]: "In available readings we have“ .kāryasvabhāvānupātino. "

[^372]: "These are the three characteristics of knowability, activity and inertia of the sattva, rajas and tamas constituents of the elements. They inhere in the guṇas and can be made the object of samyama at an advanced level."

 "athai vattvam” the explanation of this (in the bhāṣya) is “bhogāpavargārthatà” and that is "guṇesvanvayinī”; i.e, therein, that which inheres in the gunas as the

1\. In available readings we have "kāryasvabhāvānupātino. "whereas the Vivaraṇa has"kārya- rūpānupātino

purposefulness of experience or liberation[^373]is the fifth form of the elements (and) it is the object of saṃyama called 'purposefulness'

[^373]: "Having these two as their purpose is the inherent nature or teleological nature of the guṇas"

 'guṇās. marthavat[^353]",² i.e., (the guṇas) are inherent (in all these). Similarly, the bare element as the subtle form is inherent in the elements and in the transformations of the elements. And the essence of the element being inherent in gross elements and in the transformation of the elements means (that everything has a purpose).

 "teṣvi prādurbhavati[^353]”³ by ( saṃyama) on the five forms beginning with the gross in (ascending) order, i.e., firstly practising saṃyama through (on) the gross element and after direct perception of it, by mastery of it, one should (practise) saṃyama on the true nature[^376] ( of the element ).Then again on the subtle ( atom) then on the inherence (of qualities) of the guṇas, then on the purposefulness (of the guṇas) — in this way, in this order, (when saṃyama is done there is direct perception and consequently mastery over) the gross elements, etc. "tatra. bhavanti[^377]'' the yogî(then becomes one who has conquered the elements. .)

[^376]: "The minute atom is the second, the tanmātra is the third, the fourth is the guṇas sattva, rajas and tamas and the fifth is the purposefulness of the guņas. These are progressively more subtle and so saṃyama is done in a progressive order after mastery over the earlier stage; thus the fifth is the last step in this scale."

[^377]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything new to what the bhāṣya says so it has been left here to speak for itself."

ततोऽणिमादिप्रादुर्भावः कायसंपत्तद्धर्मानभिघातश्च ॥४५॥

 Then there comes about (powers such as) atomisation &c., perfection of the body and non-obstruction by the properties of the elements.

 तत्राणिमा– भवत्यणुः। लघिमा-लघुर्भवति। महिमा– महान्भवति। प्राप्तिः– अङ्गुल्यग्रेणापि स्पृशति चन्द्रमसम्। प्राक्काम्यम्– इच्छानभिघातः। भूमावुन्मज्जति निमज्जति यथोदके। वशित्वम्—भूतभौतिकवशी भवत्यवश्यश्चान्येषाम्। ईशित्वम्– तेषां प्रभवंप्ययव्यूहानामीष्टे। यत्र—कामावसायित्वम्—सत्यसंकल्पता, यथा संकल्पस्तथा भूतप्रकृतीनामवस्थानम्। न च शक्तोऽपि पदार्थविपर्यासं करोति। कस्मात् ? अन्यस्य यत्रकामावसायिनः पूर्वसिद्धस्य तथा तेषु संकल्पादिति। एतान्नष्टावैश्वर्याणि ॥

 कायसंपद्वक्ष्यमाणा। तद्धर्मानभिघातश्च– पृथ्वी मूर्त्या न निरुणद्धि योगिनः शरीरादिक्रियां, शिलामप्यनुविशतीति। नाऽऽपः स्निग्धाः क्लेदयन्ति। नाग्निरुष्णो दहति। न वायुः प्रणामी वहति। अनावरणात्मकेऽप्याकाशे भवत्यावृतः सिद्धानामप्यदृश्यो भवति ॥४५॥

 Amongst these, atomisation is (reducing one's size to that of) an atom; lightness is becoming light (in weight); largeness is becoming large; approach ( extension) is being able to touch even the moon by the fingertips; irresistible will is (absence of restraint to will) non-obstruction of desire; this is seen when one can dive into the earth as one plunges into water; control is mastery over the elements and their products (objects)

2.The bhāṣya reading is "guṇāstanmātrabhūta bhautikeṣviti sarvamarthavat" whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has "guṇāstanmātreṣu bhūteṣu bhūtavikāreṣu sarvamarthavat"  
3. The bhāṣya reading is ".. tasya rūpasya svarūpadarśanam jayaśca prādurbhavati" whereas the Vivaraṇa has " tasya darśanam jayaśca prādurbhavati"

and not being controlled by others; sovereignty is control over the appearance, disappearance and aggregation (of elements and products); capacity to fulfil desires is the capacity to will actual facts so that the elements and their natures assume the appearances that he wills.

 Though the yogī has the power, he does not cause reversal of things (in the world). Why is this so? Because by the will of another who is perfected from the beginning (īśvara) and who has the capacity to fulfil desires, the elements have been so willed. These are the eight perfections (powers). The perfection of the body will be described later.

  Non-obstruction by the properties of the elements are:

1\. The earth does not obstruct the bodily actions of the yogi through its property of hardness so that he can even enter into a stone.

2\. Water though liquid does not wet him.

3\. Fire though hot does not burn him.

4\. Wind though moving does not move him.

5\. Even in ākāśa which by nature does not cover anything he can be covered and can be invisible even to siddhas.

 He now mentions the result of saṃyama as tato' *ṇimā*.*ghātaśca*. "tatrāṇima” =what is atomisation; answer-it is an "aṇuḥ" (atom), i.e., by just desiring so (the yogi) becomes subtler than the subtle; by that atomisation he enters everything, even a diamond; and thus he becomes invisible to everyone.

 “laghimā” is “laghuḥ" = (lightness ) , ie, it is lighter even than cotton wool. By that (quality) one is capable of going everywhere without depending on anything (like a vehicle for instance). “mahimā” is (largeness); one can occupy even (the entire ) space (ether ). "prāptiḥ" is “aṅgu . masam", i.e., staying here itself (one can touch

the moon with the fingertips). "prākāmyam" = "icchā. ", i.e., able to desire whatever one wants, one with abundant will power (without restraint); "bhūmā dake", i.e., (this is seen when one dives into earth as one does in water).

 

"vaśitvam" = control over the entire world; the explanation of this is "bhūta .. sām[^378]"¹  

[^378]: "The reading available is “bhūtabhautikeṣu vasī. ."

 "īśītvam[^1]"² = "teṣam. . iṣte[^51]",³ i.e., (control over) the production, maintenance and destruction of the elements (and their products). "yatra . . . tvam", i.e., whatever is the desire that is achieved and reaches its culmination. "satyasankalpatā[^381]. "⁴

[^381]: "While the reading is “satyasankalpatā..."

 

"Śakto'pi roti[^382]",⁵ i.e., the yogī(does not cause reversal of the properties of things); he does not make fire cool; "kasmāt"? "anyasya ... kalpāt[^383]",⁶ i.e., (because the will of) Parameśvara has (willed those) substances to be in that different way. The change of element that a yogī desires to bring about, that change cannot be brought about without hatred towards that siddha, perfected from the beginning. He does not change the nature of the substance just by having an impure (contrary) feeling (desire) as he is one of good ethical behaviour[^384]."

[^384]: "Such an advanced yogīcannot be expected to have such negative thoughts."

 

"etān . ryāṇi" = (these eight perfections) like atomisation, etc., are brought out by mastery over the elements[^385].

[^385]: "The fivefold mastery spoken of in III.44 is connected with the kind of siddhis each one gives rise to."

 

“kāya nā" nā”—“taddharmānabhighātaḥ” "taddharmanabhighātaḥ" = the yogīis not obstructed by the qualities of the elements. "pṛthvī... kriyām[^51]"⁹, i.e., (the earth) by its property of (hardness does not obstruct the bodily action of the yogī). How is that? “śilām.Śati[^387].""napaḥ.yanti", i.e., even if (a yogī) stays in water for a thousand years (the waters do not wet him). “nāgni. . hati[^388]";"anāva. vṛtaḥ[^1]"¹²,i.e., though he is visible[^390] he is not visible (in space). “siddhā. vati[^391]"(even to siddhas he is not visible[^392]).

[^387]: "The Vivaraṇa leaves it without explaining it."

[^388]: "This bhāṣya text is left to speak for itself."

[^390]: "As space or ether does not serve as a covering."

[^391]: "The Vivaraṇa does not add anything to explain this line."

[^392]: "Here is an important sūtra and bhāṣya which connects each of the saṃyamas mentioned in III.44 to some specific siddhis. Commentators like Miśra and Bhikṣu have noticed the relationship and mentioned them as such in their commentaries. But the Vivaraṇakāra leaves out the relationship altogether except for the mention of those related to the mastery over the elements. The style here is so monotonous and a repetition of the bhāṣya time and again without any new insight. Other commentators would leave it with the reader to make sense by stating 'bhāṣyam sugamam', etc., or 'kāyasaṃyamādityādi sugamam'"

1.The reading available is "bhūtabhautikeṣu vasī. ."whereas the Vivarana has "bhūtabhautikavaŝī. The Vivaraṇakāra also does not explain this line but leaves it to speak for itself.  
2. Available readings have "Isitṛtvam" instead of "Išitvam".

**ग्रहणस्वरूपास्मितान्वयार्थवत्त्वसंयमादिन्द्रियजयः॥४७॥**

 By practising samyama on the process of knowing, on the essential attribute, on the 'sense-of-I', on inherence, and on the purposefulness (of sensation) there is mastery over the sense-organs.

 सामान्यविशेषात्मा शब्दादिर्विषयः। तेष्विन्द्रियाणां वृत्तिर्ग्रहणम्। न च तत्सामान्यमात्रे ग्रहणाकारः। कथमनालोचितः स्वविषयविशेष इन्द्रियेण मनसाऽनुव्यवसीयेतेति।

 Sound &c., having generic forms and particulars are the objects. The activity of the sense-organs with reference to them is 'the process of knowing' (knowledge). And this knowledge does not have the character of knowing only the generic form. For, if the particulars of an object were also not taken in by the sense-organ how will the mind be able to perceive it. 'Essential nature' is a collection of parts which are the generic form and the particular which cannot be separated from one another; it belongs to the ātman whose very nature is illumination; the sense-organ (is such) a substance.

 The third form (of the sense-organs ) is the ego ( individuality) characterised by the ‘I-sense' The sense-organs are the particulars of that generic form.

 The fourth form is of the essence of determination; the (constituent) qualities (gunas ) have illumination, activity and inertia as their ( respective ) nature and the sense-organs, along with the sense of individuality, are their manifestations.

  The fifth form is their having the purpose (goal) of puruṣa to accomplish, which is inherent in the guṇas.

 When the yogi practises samyama on these five forms of the sense-organs successively (one after another ) he conquers them in order; (then) by conquering (all) the five forms he gains mastery over the senses.

 ग्रहणस्वरूपास्मितान्वयार्थवत्त्वसंयमादिन्द्रियजयः। सर्वमेतद्गतसूत्रेण तुल्यव्याख्यानम्। अस्मितामात्रं तु विशेषो भूतानामिव तन्मात्राणि। सामान्यविशेषात्मा शब्दादिर्विषयः। तेष्विन्द्रियाणां या वृत्तिः विषयविशेषावलोकनात्मिका तत् ग्रहणम्। न च तत्सामान्यमात्रे शब्दादिसामान्याभासनमात्रे मनसि ग्रहणाकारः उपपद्यते। कथम् ? अनालोचितः स्वविषयविशेष इन्द्रियेण अनिगृहीतो निजो विषयविशेषो मनसा कथं नु नाम अनुव्यवसीयेत। न कथंचिदनुव्यवसीयेत तैमिरिकातैमिरिकयोरनुव्यवसायाननुव्यवसायाभ्याम्। तस्मान्नेन्द्रियेणानालोचिते विषये मनसा अनुव्यवसायः। तत्रास्यां विशेषात्मिकायां वृत्तौ प्रथमं संयमः कर्तव्यः॥

 *grahaṇa .* . . *indriyajayaḥ*. All this is to be explained in keeping with the earlier sūtra[^393]. The bare sense-of-I is the particular like the subtle elements in the case of the elements[^394].‘‘sāmānya ṣayaḥ[^1]"3;“teṣvi. .”, i.e, that modification of the senses with regard to them (the objects), of the nature of perceiving the particular characteristic of the object is ( knowledge, perception, process of knowing ). "na ca. kāraḥ" = (that form of knowledge) cannot come into being in the mind by just illuminating the generic properties like sound, etc. Why is that? “anāloci. vaśīyeta[^396]”,i.e., when the special characteristic of an object is not perceived (how can the mind then perceive it)? It cannot ever perceive it and is like the non-perception of one suffering from cataract (timira) and the perception of the other free from cataract. Therefore the mind does not perceive an object which has not been taken in by the senses. Therein, the first saṃyama is to be practised with reference to the modification which has this nature of particularity.

[^393]: "YS, III.44."

[^394]: "It stands in the same position as the tanmātras."

[^396]: "Available readings have “sāmânyamātragrahaṇākāram . . sa viṣayaviśeṣamanasā vasīyeteti” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “...sāmānyamātre grahaṇākāraḥ.svaviṣayaviśeșa manasā'nuvyavasīyeteti"

 "svarūpam indriyam[^1]”5,i.e., now the second form of the senses is (its own intrinsic nature); "sāmānya. ", i.e., the intrinsic nature of the senses is perception of the particular attribute of the object; this is like the lamp having the special attribute of illuminating the special shape of a pot and so on; the generic attribute is illumination alone[^398]. Therefore "ayuta . . . indriyam" (the sense-organ is a substance having inseparable different parts) of the nature of generic and particular (properties) like a lamp[^399].

[^398]: "Generic property being illumination and special is revealing the particular shape, etc., of the pot, etc."

[^399]: "The different senses lie inseparably in the I-sense and produce knowledge according to their capacity. ."

 When the quality of generic property like extension enters gross objects, then the sense-organ of the nature of illumination enters the modification of knowledge of the essence of the particular attribute of the substance. Thus saṃyama is to be practised on this second intrinsic nature of the sense-organs.

 "teṣām ṣāḥ". ( The third form) of the sense organs ( is ahaṃkāra, the sense-of- I). (Of that generic I-sense) (the particulars) inhere in the form of knowledge, accompanied by the different inseparable parts. Saṃyama is to be done on that sense-of-I.

 catur pariṇāmah[^159]''.'Saṃyama is to be done on the guṇa-inherence[^401].

[^401]: "The guṇas in which the qualities of illumination, activity and inertia inhere, are in truth the cause of knowledge which occurs when other factors are present. But without the guņas no knowledge can take place."

 pañca. vatvam[^14]",therefore everything has purposefulness and it is inherent ( in the guṇas) as explained earlier[^403].

[^403]: "Similar to what has been said in III.44."

 "eṣu pañca.. yamaḥ[^404]"5;in this manner Saṃyama is done without transgressing the order. "tatra . . . yoginaḥ[^405]",6 i.e., (mastering) each of the five one by one, he gains victory over the five forms.

[^404]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has the bhāṣya reading as "

[^405]: "While the bhāṣya has “tatra tatra.."

  Therefore, (by conquering the five forms he conquers the senses), so that the results to be described (later) ( happen to the yogī). As for the sūtra Thence there arises superior mastery of the sense-organsit is only the mastery of the modification (of the mind) with respect to grasping a particular object in the form of not having perception of the (that) object.

**ततो मनोजवत्वं विकरणभावः प्रधानजयश्च ॥४८॥**

  As a result of this there comes speed like that of the mind, knowledge without the aid of bodily instruments and mastery over the first cause.

**कायस्यानुत्तमो गतिलाभो मनोजवत्वम्। विदेहानामिन्द्रियाणामभिप्रेतदेशकालविषयापेक्षो वृत्तिलाभो विकरणभावः। सर्वप्रकृतिविकारवशित्वं प्रधानजय इति। एतास्तिस्त्रः सिद्धयो मधुप्रतीका उच्यन्ते। एताश्च करणपञ्चस्वरूपजयादधिगम्यन्ते ॥४८॥**

  Speed of the mind means that the body acquires very quick motion (comparable to that of the mind).

  Action (knowledge) without the aid of bodily instruments means modification (activity) of the discarnate-sense-organs with reference to the desired place, time or object. Subjugation of the primal cause is mastery over prakṛti and its evolutes.

5\. The Vivaraṇakāra has the bhāṣya reading as "eṣu pañcasvindriyarūpeṣu..

6\. While the bhāṣya has "tatra tatra..." the Vivaraṇa has only "tatra..."

 

These three perfections ( powers) are known as ( madhupratika). And these are obtained by the subjugation of the essence of the five sense-organs.

  

ततो मनोजवत्वं विकरणभावः प्रधानजयश्च तत इन्द्रियजयात् कायस्यानुत्तमः न विद्यतेऽस्मादुत्तम इत्यनुत्तमः गतिलाभो मनोजवत्वम्। विदेहानां शरीरनिरपेक्षाणां इन्द्रियाणां अभिप्रेतदेशापेक्षोऽभिप्रेतकालापेक्षोऽभिप्रेतशब्दादिविषयापेक्षश्च वृत्तिलाभो विकरणभावः। सर्वप्रकृतिविकारवशित्वं अष्टानां प्रकृतीनां तद्विकाराणां च वशित्वं प्रधानजय इत्येतास्तिस्रः सिद्धयो मधुप्रतीकाः इति उच्यन्ते। ताश्च पञ्चस्वरूपजयादधिगम्यन्ते ॥४८॥

 

*tato .jayaścá[^406];*' tata = by conquering the senses “kāya vatvam[^407]"² (there is great speed like that of the mind); that beyond which there is no surpassing is “anuttamaḥ" "videhā. bhāvaḥ[^408]”;³ “videhānām" = in the case of those not dependent on bodies. "sarva. ucyante", i.e., the control of the eightfold prakṛti[^409] and its evolutes is “pradhānajayaḥ”. “ityetā ucyante[^410]"; "tāśca myante[^411]".⁶

सत्त्वपुरुषान्यताख्यातिमात्रस्य सर्वभावाधिष्ठातृत्वं सर्वज्ञातृत्वं च ॥४॥

 

To him alone, who knows the difference between the sattva-intellect and puruṣa, comes supremacy of all states of existence (omnipotence) and omniscience.

 

निर्धूतरजस्तमोमलस्य बुद्धिसत्त्वस्य परे वैशारद्ये परस्यां वशीकारसंज्ञायां वर्तमानस्य सत्त्वपुरुषान्यताख्यातिमात्ररूपप्रतिष्ठस्य सर्वभावाधिष्ठातृत्वम्।

When the sattva-intellect is cleansed of the dirt of both rajas and tamas and attains perfect clarity it is in the supreme state called 'vaśīkāra' (In this state) (when the yogī) is established in the knowledge of the difference between the sattva-intellect and puruṣa, he gains supremacy over all forms of existence. The determinations of the guṇas in their essence present themselves before the owner, (the master), the knower of the field, as one whole, fit to be known.

 

Omniscience means the simultaneous rising of knowledge born of discriminate- discernment with reference to the guṇas which are the essence of all things and which are manifested as past, present and future states of existence. This is perfection called 'viśokā' attaining which the yogī becomes omniscient, with his afflictions and bondages dwindled and gaining control, he rejoices.

  

सत्वपुरुषान्यताख्यातिमात्रस्य सर्वभावाधिष्ठातृत्वं सर्वज्ञातृत्वं च। सर्वप्रकारेण सर्वसाधनेन निर्धूतरजस्तमोमलस्य सत्वस्य परे वैशारद्ये स्वच्छे स्थितिप्रवाहे परे वर्तमानस्य परस्यां वशीकारसंज्ञायां ज्ञानप्रसादमात्रे

2\. Here also the Vivaraṇakāra has". javatvam" instead of" javitvam" available in other readings. The Vivaraṇakara does not explain this line in full.

3.'The bhāṣya has ".. bhipretadeśakālaviṣayāpekṣo " but the Vivaraṇakāra quotes" bhipre-tadeśāpekṣo'bhipretakālāpekṣo' bhipretaśabdādiviṣayāpekṣaśca.

6The bhāṣya reading is "etāśca karaṇapañcasvaru. "which in the Vivaraṇa is "tāśca pañcasvarū.

*sattvapuruṣa .jñātṛtvam ca*. When in all ways and through all means "nirdhūta. . tṛtvam[^412]"¹ " = (the mind is cleansed of the dirt of rajas and tamas it exists in the) supreme pure flow of steadiness, existing in only the clarity of insight which is unexcelled. (In that state ) he rules over all forms of existence.

[^412]: "The bhāṣya “. buddhisattvasya..."

 

“sarvātmanā[^413] "²,i.e., through the changes of the different prakṛtis[^414]the determinations in essence, which are the changes into the form of the causes like buddhi, etc., closely following the properties of past, present and future (unnameable) “svāmi. ityarthaḥ[^353]"⁴ are available in the form of experience to the knower of the field, the bare sight.

[^413]: "Available readings have “sarvātmano guṇā vyavasāyavyavaseyātmakāḥ "

[^414]: "The eightfold prakṛti, ie, from prakṛti to the five elements."

 

"sarva tyarthaḥ[^416]”⁵;“akramopārūḍham" = existing at the same time, (simultaneous). “ityeṣā. vaśī[^417]'⁶ (this is the siddhi known as viśokā ) having the nature of omniscience and the nature of control over everything (omnipotence).

[^416]: "The bhāṣya reads guṇānām śānto . tvena vyavasthitānāmakramopārūḍham Vivarana has . . sarvātmakānām śānto . . . tvenāvasthitānām guṇānām akramopārūḍham. Vivaraṇakāra also does not add much to the bhâṣya reading."

[^417]: "The bhāṣya ends with "

तद्वैराग्यादपि दोषबीजक्षये कैवल्यम् ॥५०॥

 

By renouncing that, with the dwindling of the seeds of defects there follows liberation (kaivalya) also.

 

यदास्यैवं भवति क्लेशकर्मक्षये सत्त्वस्यायं विवेकीप्रत्ययो धर्मः सत्त्वं च हेयपक्षे न्यस्तं पुरुषश्चापरिणामी शुद्धोऽन्यः सत्त्वादिति। एवमस्य ततो विरज्यमानस्य यानि क्लेशबीजानि दग्ध- शालिबीजकल्पानि प्रसवासमर्थानि तानि सह मनसा प्रत्यस्तं गच्छन्ति। तेषु प्रलीनेषु पुरुषः पुनरिदं तापत्रयं न भुङ्क्ते। तदेषां गुणानां मनसि कर्मक्लेशविपाकस्वरूपेणाभिव्यक्तानां चारितार्थानाम्। प्रतिप्रसवे पुरुषस्यात्यन्तिको गुणवियोगः कैवल्यम्। तदा स्वरूपप्रतिष्ठा चितिशक्तिरेव पुरुष इति ॥५०॥

  

When there is dwindling of afflictions and of karma (he thinks) thus — this knowledge of discriminate-discernment is a property of sattva; and sattva is to be classified along with avoidable pains; but puruṣa is unchangeable, pure, and other than sattva.

1\. The bhāṣya". buddhisattvasya..." is quoted without " buddhi" and with an additional "vartamānasya" before "parasyām" in the Vivaraṇa.  
2. Available readings have "sarvātmano guṇā vyavasāyavyavaseyātmakāḥ ''where as the Vivaraṇakāra has ".. sarvātmanā guṇādhyavasāyātmakāḥ.  
4. The bhāṣya reading is "svāminam kṣetrajñam pratyaseṣadṛśyatmatvenopasthitā"whereas the Vivarana has "svāminam kṣetrajñam aśeṣaguṇaḥ dṛśyatvena avasthitaḥ.

5\. The bhāṣya reads "guṇānām sānto. tvena vyavasthitānāmakramopārūḍham "whereas the Vivaraṇa has".. sarvātmakānām sānto... tvenāvasthitānām guṇānām akramopārūḍham. The Vivaraṇakāra also does not add much to the bhāṣya reading.

6\. The bhāṣya ends with "viharati" while the Vivaraṇa quote ends with "vaśī"

In this way, when he starts getting detached from that (sattva) the seeds of affliction become like burnt seeds of grain, incapable of sprouting (and) they along with the mind, pass into latency (get absorbed). When they have been absorbed puruṣa does not experience again the threefold pain.

 

This state is that when the guṇas, which are manifested in the form of karma, afflictions and fruitions in the mind, having fulfilled their purpose, do not come into action and (therefore) there is a final separation of the puruṣa from the guṇas; this is isolation (kaivalya). Then the self (puruṣa) is nothing but consciousness abiding in its own nature.

  

तद्वैराग्यादपि दोषबीजक्षये कैवल्यम् । यदा अस्यैवं भवति सर्वज्ञस्य सर्वभावानधितिष्ठतः क्लेशकर्मक्षये विवेकी सत्वस्य प्रत्ययः । कीदृश इत्याह—सत्वं च हेयपक्षे न्यस्तं परिणामित्वाशुद्धत्वत्रिगुणत्वादिभिः । पुरुषश्च सत्वविधर्मा अपरिणामी शुद्धोऽन्यः सत्वात् इत्यनेन प्रकारेण॥

*tadvai . kaivalyam.* "yadā[^1].¹ "i.e., when the omniscient is in control of all existent things (is omnipotent); "kleśa. . pratyayaḥ[^419]".? What is this state like? He answers (through the words) "sattvam stam", i.e., (sattva knowledge is also to be put in the category of avoidable pain) as it is also subject to change, it is impure and it is composed of the three guṇas.

[^419]: "The Vivaraṇa quotes sattvasyāyam vivekī pratyayaḥ as vivekī sattvasya pratyayaḥ"

 

"puruṣa. nyah", i.e., (puruṣa is) different from sattva (knowledge) (as it is changeless, pure, so) in this manner (it is different from sattva).

 

"tataḥ bhunkte[^51]";³ moreover, being omniscient and omnipotent the (seeds of klesśa) in the form of latent impressions of avidyā (are not capable of sprouting again); they (reach a latent state) (along with the mind) which is their support and which has accomplished its purpose. (Purușa does not experience) (the threefold pain) pertaining to the self, etc[^421].

[^421]: "The other two being ādhibhautika, ādhidaivika."

 

"tadeṣām. . kaivalyam[^422]";⁵ "pratiprasave" = dissolution "tadā. puruṣaḥ[^838]"^(.6) In that context, through the word api in *tadvairāgyādapi* (in the sūtra) it is indicated that even one who does not get the perfections of (practice of) yoga attains kaivalya due to disciminate-discernment (insight[^423]).

[^422]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has "

[^423]: "It therefore appears that the perfections need not necessarily arise in all cases though that impression is created through the earlier sutra."

[^838]: #

1 Available readings have ". vivekapratyayo dharmaḥ"but the Vivaraṇakāra has vivekīpratyayo dharmaḥ"

3\. Instead of " aprasavasamarthani" the Vivaraṇakāra has prasavāsamarthāni.

5\. The Vivaraṇakāra has "tadeṣām" instead of "tadeteṣām"; instead of "caritarthānāmapratiprasave. the Vivaraṇakāra has". caritarthārnām pratiprasave. ". Just one word 'pralaye' is given for explaining "pratiprasave", otherwise the bhāṣya is left to speak for itself.  
6. No explanation is given for this and it is left to speak for itself.

स्थान्युप(नि)मन्त्रणे सङ्गस्मयाकरणं पुनरनिष्टप्रसङ्गात् ॥५१॥

 

When invited by the presiding deities there should be no attachment or smile of satisfaction, for undesirable consequences can recur.

चत्वारः खल्वमी योगिनः प्रथमकल्पिको मधुभूमिकः प्रज्ञाज्योतिरतिक्रान्तभावनीयश्चेति। तत्राभ्यासी प्रवृत्तज्योतिः प्रथमः। ऋतंभरप्रज्ञो द्वितीयः। भूतेन्द्रियजयी तृतीयः सर्वेषु भावितेषु भावनीयेषु कृतरक्षाबन्धः कर्तव्यतासाधनवान्॥

 

चतुर्थां यस्त्वतिक्रान्तभावनीयः तस्य चित्तप्रतिसर्ग एवं एकोऽर्थः। सप्तविधा तस्य प्रान्तभूमिप्रज्ञा॥

 

These yogīs are of four kinds (1) prathamakalpika, (2) madhubhūmika, ( 3 ) prajñājyotiḥ, and (4) atikrāntabhāvanīyaḥ. Amongst them the first is the one who is practising and in whom the light is dawning. The second in one who has ṛtaṃbharā prajñā (truth bearing insight). The third is one who has subjugated the elements and the sense-organs, who preserves all that has been known and has to be known, who is capable of doing what has to be done. The fourth is the atikrāntabhāvanīya. His sole aim is to get the mind absorbed (in pradhāna). His is the sevenfold insight which has reached the farthest limit (II.27).

 

तत्र मधुमतीं भूमिं साक्षात्कुर्वतो ब्राह्मणस्य स्थानिनो देवाः सत्त्वविशुद्धिमंनुपश्यन्तः स्थानैरुपनिमन्त्रयन्ते 'भो इहाऽऽस्यतामिह रम्यतां कमनीयोऽयं भोगः कमनीयेयं कन्या रसायनमिदं जरामृत्युं बाधते वैहायसमिदं यानममी कल्पदुमाः पुण्या मन्दाकिनी सिद्धा महर्षय उत्तमा अनुकूला अप्सरसो दिव्ये श्रोत्रचक्षुषी वज्रोपमः कायः स्वगुणैः सर्वमिदमुपार्जितमायुष्मता प्रतिपद्यतामिदमक्षयमजरममरस्थानं देवानां प्रियम्' इति। एवमभिधीयमानः सङ्गदोषान् भावयेद्धोरेषु संसाराङ्गारेषु पच्यमानेन मया जननमरणान्धकारे विपरिवर्तमानेन कथंचिदासादितः क्लेशतिमिरविनाशी योगप्रदीपस्तस्य चैते तृष्णायोनयो विषयवायवः प्रतिपक्षाः। स खल्वहं लब्धालोकः कथमनया विषयमृगतृष्णया वञ्चितस्तस्यैव पुनः प्रदीप्तस्य संसाराग्नेरात्मानमिन्धनीकुर्यामिति। स्वस्ति वः स्वप्नोपमेभ्यः कृपणजनप्रार्थनीयेभ्यो विषयेभ्य इत्येवं निश्चितमतिः समाधिं भावयेत्॥

 

Among these the gods in high places, observing the purity of the sattva intellect of that brāhmaṇa who has direct perception of the stage of 'madhumatī' invite him by tempting him with (enjoyments available in) their places thus: 'O great one, sit down here, enjoy yourself here; this experience is enjoyable, this girl is lovely; this elixir checks both old age and death; here is a vehicle which moves through the skies; these are the wish-fulfilling trees; this is the holy mandäkinī river; here are the perfected souls and great sages; these are the incomparable and amenable nymphs; here there is divine hearing and divine seeing; here the body is adamantine. You have gained all this by your own qualities; come and take all this; this is an eternal, ageless and deathless place which is dear to the gods.'

  

When he is addressed thus let him ponder on the defects of attachment (thus)—'Iwho have been cooked in the fearful flames of the world and who have been tossed about in the darkness of birth and death have somehow managed to get the light of yoga which destroys the darkness of afflictions. And these winds of sensual pleasures born out of greed, are its (yogīs) enemies. How can I who have obtained this light be led astray by this mirage of sensual pleasures and make myself again the fuel of that

burning fire in the form of the world? Farewell to your sensual pleasures coveted only by the weak and comparable to dreams.' Thus making up his mind he should practice 'samādhi'

 

सङ्गमकृत्वा स्मयमपि न कुर्यात्—एवमहं देवानामपि प्रार्थनीय इति। स्मयादयं सुस्थितं मन्यतया मृत्युना केशेषु गृहीतमिवात्मानं न भावयिष्यति। तथा चास्य च्छिद्रान्तरप्रेक्षी नित्यं यत्नोपचर्यप्रमादो लब्धविवरः क्लेशानुत्तम्भयिष्यति। ततः पुनरनिष्टप्रसङ्गः। एवमस्य सङ्गस्मयावकुर्वतो भावितोऽर्थो दृढी भविष्यति। भावनीयश्चार्थोऽभिमुखीभविष्यति ॥५१॥

 

Not having allowed himself to become attached he should not smile with pride in thinking that he is desired even by the gods. If he indulges in such a satisfaction and deems himself secure he will never see himself as it were gripped by the hair by death. In that way laziness, ever on the lookout for weak points and which can only be removed with great effort, having found a way, will arouse the afflictions. As a result of that, undesirable consequences will recur.

 

In this way, he who does not become attached (to pleasures) and also does not take pride (in non-attachment) becomes strengthened in the goal achieved and will come face to face with the goal to be achieved.

Just as the atom is the minutest limit of a substance so also the moment is the minutest limit of time. Or the time taken by an atom in motion to leave its earlier point of rest and reach its next point, is the time denoted as 'moment'. And sequence is its unbroken continuity.

  

There is no real collection of moments and their sequences; therefore muhurta, day, night &c., are all aggregates of mental concepts.

2\. Available readings have ".. bhāviteṣu kṛtarakṣābandhaḥ kṛtakartavyasādhanādimān"whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has ".. bhāviteṣu bhāvanîyeṣu kṛtarakṣābandhaḥ kartavyatāsādhanavān

3.The bhāṣya reading has "caturthaḥ" before "yastva. " but the quote has "yastva "before "caturthaḥ"

6\. The Vivaraṇakara leaves this to speak for itself except to give the meaning of a couple of words. It is interesting to see that instead of using phrases like "sugamam bhāṣyam" the Vivaraṇakāra uses the word "prasiddhārtham bhāṣyam" suggesting that the meaning of the bhāṣya is well-known through the com- mentary of others; and in this case could very well be that of Miśra.

 

Thus this (concept of) time though not real is created by the intellect, (mind) and corresponds to knowledge based on words; (but) it appears as real to the worldly (ordinary), emergent (out-going) mind. Whereas a moment comes under the head of reality and rests upon the sequence; and sequence has its essence in a continuous succession of moments. Those yogis who know (realise) time call that as time.

 

Two moments cannot exist at the same time, and there can be no sequence of two things which exist at the same time. It is impossible. When a later moment succeeds an earlier (moment) without interruption that is a sequence. Therefore, there is only one moment which is the present; there are no earlier and later moments; therefore, there is no collection of them (moments).

 

Past and future moments are to be explained as inherent in the mutations. Thus in a single moment the whole world passes through a mutation. All these various properties are established in that one moment.

 

By practising saṃyama on the moments and their succession there is a direct perception of them; from that there arises knowledge borne out of discriminate-discernment.

*kṣaṇa. .jñānam*. There (Vyāsa) himself explains in detail the moment and its sequence (through the words) "apakarṣa. . kṣaṇaḥ[^1]"¹ = that state at which it is not possible to totally destroy a substance is the (minutest atom). So also, due to the misconstruction of knowledge by ordinary people in the form of properties of day and night and due (to the idea of) diminution of time, with the desire to grasp that extreme limit beyond which it is not possible to reduce (time) (that is) in fact (the moment).

 

Or "yāvatā..kṣaṇaḥ[^1]"², i.e., it means that there is (the notion of) moment in all ways. "tasya.. kramaḥ[^51]"³, i.e., the "pravāha" = flow of that moment of the nature of unbroken continuity, (i.e., existence without break is the moment's sequence).

  

"kṣaṇa. . hāraḥ" = of the two (moment and its sequence), as there is no substance as sequence of a moment (in truth), and since the moment is only one, there is no aggregate of the two.

1\. Available readings have "yathakārṣa..evam paramākarṣapar ''whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has "yathā pakarṣa evam apakarṣapar "  
2. Available readings have "calitaḥ" instead of "vicalitaḥ" and ". . deśamupasaṃpadyeta. "instead of "... deśamabhisaṃpadyeta.." The Vivaraṇakāra does not give his explanation and leaves the bhāṣya to speak for itself.  
3. Instead of "tatpravāhāvicchedastu "the Vivaraṇakāra has "tasya pravāhāvicchedabhāvinaḥ.

 Objection—But then, if there is no aggregate of the moment and its sequence, how is there the occurrence of months, years and so on.

 In order to explain that he says “buddhi. . dayaḥ[^435]” = due to the idea created by the mind (intellect) of the aggregate of the moment and its sequence and due to the rising of such ideas as the contact and separation of the sun and so on with another place (there is the idea of day and night). Thus this (notion of) difference (of night and day) belongs to the mind.

[^435]: "Instead of “samāhāro”the Vivaraṇakāra has “. . . samāhārāt”"

 In the case of one whose mind has clarity and which has a flow of similar ideas, whose mind having reached the stage of one-pointedness is established in sattva; though he does have the experience of time there is sameness as far as a moment or a thousand yugas. But that is not so in the case of one who is of active mind. Thus, even in dream, through just minutes, many thousands (of miles) which can only be (traversed in) a year, is imagined by the mind. Therefore the aggregate of time is indeed a mysterious construct of the mind.

 For one for whom time is eternal, all-pervading, different from (association with) action, in his case since action alone reaches culmination either quickly or in a long time, there is no logical reason for the existence of a separate time. Action[^436]has a fixed measure as there is no knowledge of action as something that does not take notice of the measure. Thus we say ‘he sleeps till the time of milking the cow’or ‘he studies till the time the rice is cooked’That is itself time. In the case of its being eternal, all-pervading, as it has no connection with the immutable one, it is consistent to imagine it like a journey being separated from other substances[^437].

[^436]: "Time is not relevant here, action alone is—it makes no sense to talk about time in this sense."

[^437]: "An eternal, all-pervading substance cannot be imagined other than the immutable; moreover other problems like the relationship with the immutable will have to be explained."

 Question—If time (is conceived) as having action (that which operates an action), having a limit like a journey, then (the answer is)—since it is also determined by having action and also possessing action itself, it is itself to be subject to a limit and so it will be limited; and that also will be in need of another and so there will be infinite regress. Moreover by possessing action there is the contingency of its being nonpermanent.

 Question—If it is said that time can be considered to be determined by its own activity then (the answer is)—others also can be measured by their own activity; therefore it will be futile to imagine time as a separate entity; then action (operation) itself can be called time.

 Question—Even so, it can be said that by its bare existence, time is something that sets limits then (the answer is)—it will lead to the conclusion that everything else as well can be so considered by the fact of existence.

 Question—If it is said, even in the view of considering time as action this confusion is present then (the answer is)—it is not so; action (to accomplish some activity) is well-known (in the world). Having a limit is established in such examples as ‘He sits till the time of milking the cow’, etc., it is known that activity is itself the one that sets a limit and there is no other time that sets the limit. In such (concepts as) in a long time, quickly, the idea is created by slow and skilful effort and it is not bound by a different time. Thus he says “sa khalvayam. . mānaḥ”, i.e., (time) in the form of a year, etc., is measured by the intellect (mind[^438]).

[^438]: "It does not have existence as a year, etc., in truth."

 “sabda. bhāsate[^439]”;a moment, a wink of the eye, day, night, all these follow the

[^439]: "Instead of “śabdajñānānupātī” in available readings the Vivaraṇakāra has “śabdadharmānupātī” The Vivaraṇakāra also does not explain the portion “laukikānām . . . sate”and leaves the bhāṣya to speak for itself."

mental construction arising from words. “kṣaṇa... laṃbī[^839]”(moment) is real and it is to be inferred by the attainment of another state by a substance (depending on a sequence). “krama . . tmā”= (continuity) is due to the idea of an unbroken flow of moments.

[^839]: # "Instead of “vastupatitaḥ . . .” in available readings the Vivaraṇakāra has “vasturūpaḥ."

 “tam yoginaḥ”= (that) moment (is called time by yogīs). “na ca . vataḥ”= (two moments cannot exist together) whose aggregate can be imagined. In one substance it is not possible to have two moments born at the same time. Caitra who is born is born in one moment; “na ca . vataḥ[^440]”, why is this so[^441]?“dvayoḥ vāt[^442]”. “dvayoḥ”= (two) moments.

[^440]: "This has already been mentioned above and no purpose is served by repeating it again; this is not careful writing."

[^441]: "Why cannot two moments exist together is the question raised."

[^442]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has already explained this; so there is nothing more to be said."

 “pūrva.. kramaḥ” = just as from a lump of clay there is a continuity as a pot which comes into being later, that is a sequence. Of the lump of clay that exists in the wheel the pot that comes into being from the lump of clay that exists in the wheel, does not belong to the sequence[^443].“tasmā . . . samāhāraḥ”; (moment is only the present); it is not the earlier and the later, the past and the future (not-as-yet-manifest), as that which is earlier and later have only the nature of a substance; and a substance is firmly established in the present moment. (Therefore there is no) aggregate of the moment and its sequence.

[^443]: "The relationship between the clay and pot in the context of sequence is being discussed."

 ये तु भूतभाविनः अतीतभविष्यन्तः क्षणाः ते धर्मिणः परिणामास्तितया धर्मिपरिणामापेक्षया व्याख्येयाः। तेनैकेन क्षणेन कृत्स्नो लोकः परिणाममनुभवति । तत्क्षणोपारूढाः वर्तमानक्षणोपारूढाः खल्वमी सर्वे धर्माः सर्वपदार्थाः ॥

 “ye tu . . .khyeyāḥ[^444]”, i.e., the past and future (moments) (are to be explained) in terms of the changes of the substance. “tenai . . . bhavati[^287]”. “tatkṣa . . . dharmāḥ”, i.e., all things are firmly established in the present moment.  
 The statement mentioned that there is no sequence of the past moment serves the following purpose, i.e., there is rejection of a sequence to that sequence (and so on). If there is a sequence to a sequence to a moment, then there will be the contingency of substancehood of the sequence of a moment. Only a substance has sequence. Then (the statement) of practising saṃyama on the sequence and its moments will not fit[^446]. Therefore “etayoḥ. . karaṇam[^447]”. “tata . . . bhavati[^448]”,i.e., as all objects are marked

[^444]: "Instead of “... pariṇāmānvitā . . .”in available texts the Vivaraṇakāra has “. . . pariṇāmāstitayā."

[^446]: "If sequence is a substance then saṃyama can be practised on it as well as on the moments; but that does not fit."

[^447]: "Instead of “tayoḥ”the Vivaraṇa has “etayoḥ”. No explanation is given for the bhāṣya."

[^448]: "“prādurbhavati”is missing in the Vivaraṇa."

by the moment and its sequence he (the yogī) realises all those objects in their divisions[^449].

[^449]: "In their entirety—therefore it is discriminating insight."

**तस्य विषयविशेष उपक्षिप्यते—**

 The particular thing which is the object of this discriminate—discernment is being mentioned.

**जातिलक्षणदेशैरन्यताऽनवच्छेदात्तुल्ययोस्ततः प्रतिपत्तिः ॥५३॥**

 As a result of that (discriminate-discernment ) there is (deeper) knowledge of two similar (indistinguishable) things which cannot be distinguished by genus, by a characterisitc mark, or by the space (they occupy).

 **तुल्ययोर्देशलक्षणसारूप्ये जातिभेदोऽन्यताया हेतुः, गौरियं वडवेयमिति। तुल्यदेशजातित्वे लक्षणमन्यत्वावच्छेदकरं, कालाक्षी गौः स्वस्तिमती गौरिति। द्वयोरामलकयोर्जातिलक्षणसारूप्ये देशभेदोऽन्यत्वकरः, इदं पूर्वमिदमुत्तरमिति। यदा तु पूर्वमामलकमन्यव्यग्रस्य ज्ञातुरुत्तरदेश उपावर्तते, तदा तुल्यदेशत्वे पूर्वमेतदुत्तरमेतदिति प्रविभागानुपपत्तिः। असंदिग्धेन च तत्वज्ञानेन भवितव्यमित्यत इदमुक्तं, ततः प्रतिपत्तिर्विवेकजज्ञानादिति ॥**

 When two similar things have the same characteristic mark and the same point of space the difference in genus is the cause for distinction thus—this is a cow, this is a mare. When the point of space and genus are the same, characteristic mark is the cause for distinction as other; thus—the cow with black eyes, the auspicious cow.

 Since two myrobalan fruits have the same genus and characteristic marks the difference in point of space is the cause for distinction; thus—this is in front, this is at the back.

 But when the myrobalan in front is reversed to the back when the observer (knower) is not attentive, then the position becoming the same it is not possible to detect the difference (in the fruits) as this is in front (and) this is at the back. This can only be accomplished through certain and correct knowledge; therefore it is said that there is (deeper) knowledge as a result of that discriminate-discernment.

**कथं ? पूर्वामलकसहक्षणो देश उत्तरामलकसहक्षणाद्देशात् भिन्नः। ते चाऽऽमलके स्वदेशक्षणानुभवभिन्ने।**

** अन्यदेशक्षणानुभवस्तयोरन्यत्वे हेतुरिति। एतेन दृष्टान्तेन परमाणोस्तुल्यजातिलक्षणदेशस्य पूर्वपरमाणुदेशसहक्षणसाक्षात्करणादुत्तरपरमाणोस्तद्देशापवृतावुत्तरस्य तद्देशानुभवभिन्नः क्षणः। क्षणभेदात्तयोरीश्वरस्य योगिनोऽन्यत्वप्रत्ययो भवतीति ॥**

** अपरे तु वर्णयन्ति—येऽन्त्या विशेषास्तेऽन्यताप्रत्ययं कुर्वन्तीति। तत्रापि देशलक्षणभेदो मूर्तिव्यवधिजातिभेदश्चान्यत्वे हेतुः। क्षणभेदस्तु योगिबुद्धिगम्य एवेति। अत उक्तं—मूर्तिव्यवधिजातिभेदाभावान्नास्ति मूलपृथक्त्वमिति वार्षगण्यः ॥ ५३ ॥**

 How is this? The space connected with the moment of time of the myrobalan in front is different from the space connected with the moment time of the myrobalan at the back. And the two myrobalan fruits are different because of the difference in

experience (sequence) between their respective space and their respective moments in time; whereas the experience of the connection between space and another moment of time is the cause of the distinction between the two. This example illustrates the case of two atoms which have the same genus, characteristics and point of space. By direct perception of the correlation in space of the atom in front with its moment of time one sees that it is inconsistent for another atom to have the same space correlation (as the first). This experience of correlation in space of another atom is different because of the difference in the sequential notion; it is by that difference (in sequential notion) that Īśvara and a yogīcome to know the distinction between them.

 Others (Vaiśeṣikas) mention that those ultimate particulars produce the idea of difference. Even there the difference in space, in characteristics, as well as difference in form, in distance and in genus is the cause for distinction. But that change in moment is grasped by the intellect of the yogīalone.

 Therefore it has been said by Vārṣagaṇya that ‘Since there is no difference on account of form, intervening space or genus there is no distinction in the primal cause (of things).’

 तस्य विवेकजस्य ज्ञानस्य कीदृशं ज्ञेयमिति तस्य विषयविशेषः उपक्षिप्यते—जातिलक्षणदेशैरन्यतानवच्छेदात् तुल्ययोस्ततः प्रतिपत्तिः। (तुल्ययोर्देशलक्षणसारूप्ये) जातिभेदः पदार्थानाम् अन्यतायाः अन्यत्वावच्छेदस्य हेतुः। यथा—गौरियं वडवेयमिति ॥

 In order to know the nature of the known of that knowledge born of insight (discriminate-discernment) (Vyāsa introduces the next sūtra through the words) “tasya viṣaya. pyate”  
* jātilakṣaṇa* . . . *pattiḥ*. “tulyayo . . . veyamiti[^450]”,i.e., (the difference in genus) is the (cause) for distinction as another like (this is a cow, this is a mare).

[^450]: "Except for adding words to the bhāṣya in order to complete the sense the Vivaraṇakāra does not explain it."

 Where there is no difference in genus and the genus is one there “tulya. gauriti[^451]”.

[^451]: "Instead of “.. anyatvakaram .”the Vivaraṇa has “. . anyatvāvacchedakaramNo explanation is given and the bhāṣya is left as it is."

 Where there is no difference of genus and no difference of characteristic mark there it is the difference in space which is the cause for distinction as another thus “dvayo. uttaramiti[^452]”.

[^452]: "Instead of “... sārūpyāt. .”the Vivaraṇa has “... sārūpye...”Nothing much is added to the bhāṣya reading as well except to add the word āmalakam after “pūrvam”."

 “yadā tu . nupapattiḥ”, i.e., ( when the āmalaka in front is shifted to the back)

when the mind (of the knower) is confused and the one at the back is shifted to the front (there is difficulty in distinguishing) between the two equal ones. “asandi nāditi”, i.e., as (that to be known) is in the same form (it is difficult to distinguish them as this is the one in front, etc.); by saṃyama on the moment and its sequence, through insight that is born through discriminate-discernment that is obtained, there is knowledge (of the distinction).

 “katham . . . nubhavabhinne” - (How does that happen); the space co-existent (with the moment of time) of the myrobalan in front is different from the space co-existent with the myrobalan at the back. (The two) are co-existent with the front and back moments; “svadeśa . . ”when marked by their own respective spaces, if a moment is experienced as different when it is marked by experience of its respective place and moment (its distinction is known through experience of connection with space and another moment of time[^453]).

[^453]: "Insight through saṃyama on the moment and its sequence can achieve this. Instead of “... nubhavastutayora ...”the Vivaraṇa has“ nubhavastayora...”"

 “anena . . kṣaṇaḥ[^454]”,i.e., by direct perception of the moment co-existent with the space of the minute atom in front, even when it is placed in the space in front[^455] (the moment is different as experienced with the space of the one at the back). “ksaṇa .
bhavati[^456]”;“anyatvapratyayaḥ”= that which limits the difference.

[^454]: "Available readings have . . . “etena. . duttarasya paramāṇostaddeśānupapattāvuttarasya taddeśānubhavo bhinnaḥsahakṣaṇa.. whereas the Vivaraṇa has “anena. duttaraparamāṇostaddeśāpavṛtāvuttarasya taddeśānubhavabhinnaḥkṣaṇaḥ, kṣaṇabhedā ...”"

[^455]: "By moving the myrobalan to the front."

[^456]: "Not much of an explanation is provided by the Vivaraṇakāra."

 “atrāpare . kurvantīti[^457]”others say that the (particular characteristics of the) minutest atoms are eternal, (they create the knowledge of difference); so what is the need for saṃyama on a specific moment and its specific space. Just as the particularities inherent in a pot, etc., create an idea of difference similarly the particularities inherent in a minutest atom create the idea of its existence and also the idea of the existence of its respective co-existents. It also brings about the idea of the difference in support[^458].

[^457]: "There is no “eva” in the bhāṣya which the Vivaraṇahas as “te eva anyatā."

[^458]: "When the support changes from the front to the back, for instance, as given in the example."

 अत्रोच्यते—देशलक्षणभेदो मूर्तिव्यवधिजातिभेदश्चान्यत्वे हेतुः उक्त एव स्थूलेषु (न तु) ननु परमाणुषु प्रतिक्षणपरिणामित्वात् । अवस्थितेषु हि विशेषेष्वन्त्येषु स्यादन्यथाऽवधारणम् । न चानवरतपरिणामेषु घटते ॥

यदा पूर्वःपरमाणुरुत्तरपरमाणुरूपेण परिणमते, पूर्वपरमाणुरूपेण चोत्तरः, तत्रावस्थितान्त्यविशेषाभावाद्विवेकप्रतिपत्तिरनुपपन्ना। तत्रावश्यं क्षणतत्क्रमसंयमजनितविवेकज्ञानादेव संप्रतिपत्तिः। अनित्याश्च परमाणव इति ह्युक्तम्। तस्मात् क्षणभेदस्तु योगिबुद्धिगम्य एव ।

 तथा चानित्यत्वस्य परमाणूनामाचार्यान्तरमतप्रतिपादनद्वारेण प्रसिद्धिंदर्शयति—अत उक्तम्— मूर्तिव्यवधिजातिभेदाभावात् नास्ति मूल(जाति)पृथक्त्वमिति वार्षगण्यः । यथा प्रतिक्षेत्रज्ञं प्रधानबुहुत्वं न्यायविरुद्धं मूर्तिव्यवधिजातिभेदाभावात् प्रधानानां पृथक्त्वम् एकपुरुषार्थदृश्यवत् अनुपपन्नम्, एवं परमाणूनामपि मूलत्वे पृथक्त्वं नोपकल्पते। ततश्च एकं मूलमिति प्राप्तम्। न परमाणुभेदो हि नित्यो युक्तः। परमाणूनां च मूर्तत्वात् रूपादिमत्त्वाच्च अनित्यत्वं घटादिवदेवेति ॥५३॥

 In this connection he says “deśa. . hetuḥ”; it is already said that the changes are in the gross objects and not in the minutest atoms as they (the elements) are constantly changing. If the ultimate particulars were stable (always, which is not the case according to their philosophy) then it would lead to the ascertainment of difference. But that is not possible in the case of those that are constantly changing.

 When the minutest atom in front changes to the form of the minutest atom at the back and the one at the back changes into the form of the minutest atom in front, due to the absence of the existent ultimate particular property, knowledge due to insight is not possible[^459]. In this case it is definitely only due to the insight that arises by saṃyama on the moment and its sequence that there is knowledge (of the difference). It is also said that the ultimate minute atoms are impermanent[^460]. Therefore “kṣaṇa . iti”(difference of moments comes through yogic insight).

[^459]: " Saṃyama reveals what is present so in this case it is not there and so cannot be known."

[^460]: "As in Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika the atoms are classified as both eternal and non-eternal."

 Thus he indicates the well-known feature of non-eternity of the minute atoms through pointing out another view of the ācārya[^461]as “ata uktam vārṣaganyaḥ”, i.e., just as many pradhānas, in relation to each puruṣa (the embodied ones) is contradictory to logic due to the absence of difference of form, intervening space or genus, it is not proper to have many different pradhānas like the (many) objects serving the purpose of a puruṣa; in a similar way, it is not befitting to have difference in the basic nature of the minute atoms. From that it follows that there is one basis; it is not logical to consider the difference of the minute atoms as eternal.

[^461]: "Ācārya Vārṣagaṇya."

 As the minute atoms have form as well as have colour, etc., they have non-permanence just like a pot and so on[^462].

[^462]: "Thus in Yoga the atoms are all similar with the three qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas. The differences of substances arise due to the preponderance of one or the other guṇa in the product."

**तारकं सर्वविषयं सर्वथाविषयमक्रमं चेति विवेकजं ज्ञानम् ॥५४॥**

 Knowledge which is born out of discriminate-discernment is a deliverer, it has all objects as its sphere of action, (all-comprehensive) it has all times (past, present and future) as its objects and it is without succession.

**तारकमिति स्वप्रतिभोत्थमनौपदेशिकमित्यर्थः। सर्वविषयं नास्य किञ्चिदविषयीभूतमित्यर्थः। सर्वथाविषयमतीतानागतप्रत्युत्पन्नं सर्वपर्यायैः सर्वथा जानातीत्यर्थः। अक्रममित्येकक्षणोपारूढं सर्वं सर्वथा गृह्णातीत्यर्थः। एतद्विवेकजं ज्ञानं परिपूर्णम्। अस्यैवांशो योगप्रदीपः मधुमतीं भूमिमुपादाय यावदस्य परिसमाप्तिरिति ॥५४॥**

 The word ‘tāraka’means that it comes out of one's own intuition and is not due to instruction (from others). Since it has all things as its objects there is nothing which is not its object. It has all times as its object means that all things past, present and future, along with their respective features, are known at all times. ‘Without succession’means the ‘grasping at all times of the whole’as presented (to the intellect) in a moment. This is the complete form of knowledge born of discriminate-discernment. The light of yoga is a part of this, beginning with madhumatī and ending with this stage.

  तारकं सर्वविषयं सर्वथाविषयम् अक्रमं चेति विवेकजं ज्ञानम्। काष्ठाप्राप्तं ज्ञानं देवर्षिगन्धर्वादीनाम्। तारकमिति। विवेकजमिदमुच्यते स्वप्रतिभोत्थमनौपदेशिकमित्यर्थः। नान्येनोपदेष्टुं शक्यं, नाप्युपदेशेन यथावत् ग्रहीतुं शक्यते। यस्मात् तत् सर्ववस्तुविषयम्। नास्य किंचिदविषयीभूतम्।

 तत् एतद्विवेकजं ज्ञानं परिपूर्णम्, अस्यैवांशो योगप्रदीपः। स एव ज्ञानांशो योगश्च प्रदीपश्च। योगस्य वा प्रदीपो योगप्रदीपः। मधुमतीं भूमिमुपादाय आरभ्य यावदस्य विवेकजस्य ज्ञानस्य परिसमाप्तिः तावत्। विवेकजज्ञानपरिसमाप्तिपर्यन्तानि ज्ञानानि मनोजवत्त्वादियुक्तानि अस्यैवांशः ॥५४॥

 *tārakam* . . . *jñānam*. Knowledge that has reached its limit belongs to the devas, the ṛṣis (sages) and the gandharvas (denizens of atmosphere). “tārakam . rthah”= it is born of insight regarding which it is said that it is not capable of being instructed by another[^840]nor is it grasped sufficiently by instruction. So it is “sarva bhūtam[^463]”.

[^463]: "Available readings have “sarvaviṣayatvānnāsya . . .”.whereas the vivaraṇa has “sarvaviṣayam But the quote in the Vivaraṇa has Sarvavastuviṣayam...”. The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything newto the bhāṣya reading."

[^840]: # "It rises spontaneously by yogic practice in oneself not due to any guru’s instruction."

 “sarvathā . . jānāti”, i.e.,(he knows) all things along with all its properties in all ways. “akramam . . . gṛhṇāti”, i.e., in one moment (he grasps everything in all ways); it is not (knowing) in sequential order as in the case of all of us.

 “etat ... dīpaḥ”this part of knowledge is yoga as well as a lamp. Or “yogapradīpaḥ”can be called the lamp of yoga. “madhu . . . māptiḥ”, i.e., starting with (the stage of madhumatī[^464])it reaches its culmination in the rise of insight born of discriminate- discernment. Different types of knowledge till such time as reaching insight born of discriminate-discernment connected with the speed of the mind, is part of this[^465].

[^464]: "First stage of ṛtaṃbharā prajñā."

[^465]: "Cf. YS, III.48 and also others mentioned here and there are all parts of this siddhi."

**प्राप्तविवेकजज्ञानस्याप्राप्तविवेकजज्ञानस्य वा—**

Whether knowledge is born of discriminate-discernment or not born of discriminate-discernment.

**सत्त्वपुरुषयोः शुद्धिसाम्ये कैवल्यमिति ॥५५॥**

 When purity of the sattva intellect and of puruṣa become equal ‘kaivalya’(isolation, liberation ) is obtained.

**यदा निर्धूतरजस्तमोमलं बुद्धिसत्त्वं पुरुषस्यान्यताप्रत्ययमात्रं दग्धक्लेशबीजं भवति तदा पुरुषस्य शुद्धिसारूप्यमिवापन्नं भवति, तदा पुरुषस्योपचरितभोगाभावः शुद्धिः। एतस्यामवस्थायां कैवल्यं भवतीश्वरस्यानीश्वरस्य वा विवेकजज्ञानभागिन इतरस्य वा। न हि दग्धक्लेशबीजस्य ज्ञाने पुनरपेक्षा काचिदस्ति। सत्त्वशुद्धिद्वारेणैतत्समाधिजमैश्वर्यं ज्ञानं चोपक्रान्तम्। परमार्थतस्तु ज्ञानाददर्शनं निवर्तते। तस्मिन्निवृत्ते न सन्त्युत्तरे क्लेशाः। क्लेशाभावात्कर्मविपाकाभावः। चरिताधिकाराश्चैतस्यामवस्थायां गुणा न पुरुषस्य पुनरदृश्यत्वेन आतिष्ठन्ते। तत्पुरुषस्य कैवल्यम्। तदा पुरुषः स्वरुपमात्रज्योतिरमलः केवली भवति ॥५५॥**

 When the sattva-intellect is cleansed of the dirt of rajas and tamas with the seeds in the form of afflictions burnt and has the bare knowledge of the difference of puruṣa (from itself) then it attains a purity equal to that of puruṣa, as it were; at that stage, the cessation of experience falsely attributed to the self, is purity of puruṣa. At this stage ‘kaivalya’comes into being for one who has the powers (siddhis) or for one who does not have the powers, for one who has got knowledge born of discriminate-discernment or for one who does not have it. When discriminate-discernment is achieved in the case of one whose seed of afflictions is burnt, there is no need of anything else (for attaining kaivalya).

 It has been started earlier that through the purity of the sattva-intellect there arises, due to samādhi, various powers (siddhis) as well as discriminate-discernment. Whereas the truth is that misapprehension (adarśanam) is removed by discriminate-discernment. When that is removed there are no more afflictions (such as asmitā, rāga &c.). In the absence of the afflictions there is absence of the fruition of karma. And at this stage the guṇas, having fulfilled their purpose, do not present themselves again as objects to be seen by puruṣa. That is the self’s ‘kaivalya’Then the self shines by itself, is free from dirt and is isolated.

 योगजे ज्ञानैश्वर्ये अतिक्रान्ते परिसमापिते च। नातः परं योगज्ञानमैश्वर्यं च।तद(दु)पक्रमणाच्च प्राप्तज्ञानैश्वर्यस्यैव तद्वैराग्यानन्तरं कैवल्यमिति प्राप्तमत आह—प्राप्तविवेकज्ञानस्य (अप्राप्तविवेकज्ञानस्य वा) बाह्यदर्शननिवृतौ कैवल्यम्। कथमिति ? सत्त्वपुरुषयोः शुद्धिसाम्ये कैवल्यमिति ॥

 When perfections and knowledge arising out of yoga have been completed and accomplished. There is no yogic knowledge or perfection beyond this. When that (insight) arises, after that insight, the one who gains knowledge and perfections (or perfection of yoga) achieves kaivalya; so he says ‘prāpta . . . vā”, i.e., when there is

ENTIRE FOOTNOTE IS NOT GETTING SAVED

cessation of outward seeing there is kaivalya. How is that (kaivalya)? *sattvapuruṣayoḥ śuddhisāmye kaivalyamiti.*

 “yadā... pannam[^466]”, i.e., (the intellect) has the wonderful bare knowledge of difference (of itself) and it has the nature of (all) subliminal-impressions of ideas of avidyā turning back (ceasing to exist); (then it attains as it were, purity equal to that of puruṣa).

[^466]: " Available readings have “...puruṣasyānyātapratītimātrādhikāram..”whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “. puruṣasyānyatāpratyayamātram...”"

 Even though the three-guṇa (intellect) is different (in nature) from puruṣa and puruṣa is also different from it (the intellect) still, because of the change into the idea of difference from puruṣa it is mentioned (that it attains purity, as it were, equal to that of puruṣa). “etasyām. . tarasya vā[^467]”,i.e., since both[^468]have the purpose of cessation of avidyā therefore (kaivalya happens in both cases). “na hi .

[^467]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything new to the bhāṣya and leaves it to speak for itself."

[^468]: " The two being-one who got the perfections and the other one who did not."

pekṣā”. As one who has insight considers everything as composed of the three gunas and also (knows) that the idea having the three guṇas is to be avoided, there is no dependence whatsoever on that in the case of knowledge beginning with madhumatī.

 यत्तु योगज्ञानमैश्वर्यं चोक्तं, तत् सम्यग्दर्शनार्थानुक्रान्तसत्त्वशुद्धिपदमार्गेण प्रकान्तमानुषङ्गिकम्। परमार्थतस्तु ज्ञानाददर्शनं विनिवर्तते। तस्मिन् विनिवृत्ते न सन्त्युक्तक्लेशाः अस्मितादयः। तेषामविद्याक्षेत्रत्वात्। क्लेशाभावाच्च कर्मविपाकाभावः “क्लेशमूलः कर्माशयः”“सति मूले तद्विपाकः”इति हि प्रतिपादितम्॥

 तस्मात् सम्यग्दर्शनार्थमेवेदं शास्त्रम्, न ज्ञानैश्वर्यविभूतिप्रयोजनम्। चरिताधिकाराश्चैतस्यामवस्थायां गुणाः न पुरुषस्य पुनर्दृश्यत्वेनातिष्ठन्ते। तत् पुरुषस्य कैवल्यम्। तदा पुरुषः स्वरूपमात्रज्योतिः इति अमलः केवलीभवति इति। इति शब्दः समाप्त्यर्थः ॥५५॥

 The mention of yogic insight and perfections is connected with the commencement of the path of purity of the sattva-intellect which follows the purpose of insight.
“paramār..kleśāḥ[^469]”; “kleśāḥ”= are asmitā, etc., as they have avidyā as their field (basis). “kleśā...bhāvah[^470]”(when the afflictions are burnt the fruit is absent) as has been already mentioned (in the sūtras) *kleśamūlaḥ karmāśayaḥ[^471]*and *sati mūle tadvipākaḥ[^472]*.

[^469]: "While the bhāṣya has“. dadarśanam nivartate . . . tasmin nivṛte santyuttare kleśāḥ”the Vivaraṇaquote is dadarśanam vinivartate, tasmin vinivṛtte na santyuktakleśāḥ”The Vivaraṇakāra also doesnot give much of an explanation and leaves the bhāṣya to speak for itself."

[^470]: "The Vivaraṇa has an additional “ca” after “kleśābhāvāt”which is not therein the bhāṣya."

[^471]: "YS, II. 12."

[^472]: " YS, II.13."

 Therefore this śāstra is for the sake of (bringing about) insight (discriminate-discernment), and it does not have the purpose of bringing about perfections of knowledge and power. “caritā. . .

bhavati”.

 The word “iti”is to indicate the end (of the work).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4\. The bhāṣya has “punarapekṣā kācidasti", whereas the Vivaraṇa has" . . kāchidapekṣā"

9.The Vivaraṇa has an additional “iti" after "svarūpamātrajyotih". TheVivaraṇakāra leaves thebhāṣya to speak for itself.

**इति श्रीमहर्षिपतञ्जलिविरचिते योगसूत्रे तृतीयो विभूतिपादः ॥**

Thus ends the third pāda called Vibhūtipādaḥ in the *Yogasūtra* written by Patañjali, the great ṛṣi.

**इति श्रीपातञ्जले सांख्यप्रवचने योगशास्त्रे व्यासभाष्ये विभूतिपादस्तृतीयः ॥५६॥**

Thus ends the third (chapter) called the Vibhūtipāda in the commentary by Vyāsa on the sūtras of Patañjali, also called ‘Sāṅkhyapravacana’

इति श्रीगोविन्दभगवत्पूज्यपादशिष्यस्य परमहंसपरिव्राजकाचार्यस्य श्रीशङ्करभगवतः कृतौ पातञ्जलयोगसूत्रभाष्यविवरणे विभूतिपादस्तृतीयः ॥

Thus ends the third chapter called the Vibhūtipādaḥ in the Vivaraṇa on the commentary on the *Yogasūtras* of Patañjali composed by Śrī Bhagavatpāda Śaṅkara the paramahaṃsa-parivrājaka-ācārya who is the disciple of the Śrī Govindapāda.

**कैवल्यपादः**  

**Kaivalyapādaḥ**  

जन्मौषधिमन्त्रतपः समाधिजाः सिद्धयः ॥१॥

 The powers (perfections) are due to birth, medicinal herbs (drugs), incantations, austerities and becoming one with the object (samādhi).

 **देहान्तरिता जन्मना सिद्धिः। ओषधिभिरसुरभवनेषु रसायनेनेत्येवमादि। मन्त्रैराकाशगमनाणिमादिलाभः। तपसा संकल्पसिद्धिः कामरूपी यत्र तत्र कामग इत्येवमादि। समाधिजाः सिद्धयो व्याख्याताः ॥१॥**

 The power by birth is that in another body. (The power) by medicinal herbs (drugs) is that obtained by elixir and so on in the houses of ‘asuras’(The power) through incantations is the achievement of atomisation, passage through space and so on. (The power) through austerities is the attainment of one's desires, able to go wherever one desires to go and so on. The powers born through ‘samādhi’have already been explained.

 In the first pāda, samādhi has been mainly dealt with. In the second pāda its (samādhi's) means have been explained. And in the third pāda has been shown the practice of the means of yoga for the sake of correct insight and a list of the various powers and knowledge which arise in connection with that practice. And all that is pain has been shown by the story of Jaigīṣavya[^473]. And cessation of pain has been

[^473]: "YS, III.18. Cf. Rukmani, Yogavārttika of Vijñānabhiksu, vol. III, Vibhūtipāda, pp. 94-98."

described as the absolute stopping (of the activity or power) of the guṇas. Thus it is said *tadvairāgyādapi doṣabījakṣaye kaivalyam[^474]*.And immediately afterwards it is said prāptavivekajñānasyāprāptavivekajñānasya vā[^475],*sattvapuruṣayoḥ śuddhisāmye**kaivalyam*[^476].And that kaivalya has to be shown to come about by the accomplishment of opposition (to bad karma)—therefore this Kaivalyapāda comes in order (here to indicate that).

[^474]: "YS, III.50. By renouncing that, with the dwindling of the seeds of defects, there follows kaivalya"

[^475]: "The introduction to YS, III.55. Cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. III, pp. 210 ff. For one who has knowledge born of insight or has no such knowledge born of insight."

[^476]: "YS, III.55. When purity of the sattva intellect and of puruṣa become equal, kaivalya is obtained."

 Similarly, it has to be shown that the various means for removal of the latent impressions accumulated through many lives are also for the sake of kaivalya. Thus will be mentioned another perfection not mentioned earlier, in order to glorify those perfections of samadhi which are useful for kaivalya. Amongst those which belong to the same class, condemning one means praise for another. By such sūtras as *tatradhyānajamanāśayam[^477] that which is the result of samādhi is free from karmāśaya"), karmāśuklākṛṣṇam yoginastrividhamitareṣām[^478]*which will be mentioned (later), the purpose of praise will be revealed.

[^477]: "YS, IV.6. Of these (five powers

[^478]: "YS, IV.7. The yogī's karma is neither white nor black; that of the others is of three kinds."

 janmauṣadhimantratapaḥ samādhijāḥ siddhayaḥ. “dehāntaritā”= (the power by birth) when due to yogic powers one obtains birth in other bodies[^479], in heaven and so on. “oṣadhibhi rasāyanena”= by consuming somarasa, āmalaka (myrobalan), etc., without getting rid of the previous body, (one can get these powers). By repeating mantras “ākāśagamana”, etc. (one achieves movement through space, etc.). “tapasā.ityevamādiḥ[^480]”. The perfections born through samādhi have already been explained.

[^479]: "As gods in heaven or as apsaras in antarikṣa."

[^480]: "The Vivaraṇa does not add anything new to the bhāṣya. Available readings have ‘yatra tatra' in place of just 'yatra' in the Vivaraṇa. So also the available bhāṣya readings have 'kāmagaḥ' whereas the Vivaraṇa has 'kāmagamana'"

**तत्र कायेन्द्रियाणामन्यजातिपरिणतानाम्—**

 In that context, with reference to the body and sense-organs which have under-gone change in another birth:

**जात्यन्तरपरिणामः प्रकृत्यापूरात् ॥२॥**

 The change in another birth comes into being because of the filling-in-process of prakṛti.

** पूर्वपरिणामापाये उत्तरपरिणामोपजनस्तेषामपूर्वावयवानुप्रवेशेन भवति। कायेन्द्रियप्रकृतयश्च स्वं स्वं विकारमनुगृह्णन्त्यापूरेण धर्मादिनिमित्तमपेक्षमाणा इति॥२॥**

The giving up of the earlier change and the coming into being of the later change (mutation) is effected by the creative causes entering (interpenetrating) the new arrangement of parts. And the creative principles of the body and sense-organs help their own (respective) change (evolved effect) by a filling-in-process depending upon dharma &c., (merit and demerit) as the instrumental (efficient) causes.

 तत्र सिद्धिः कार्यकरणानामुत्कर्षः। जन्मसिद्धौ तु पतितपूर्वोपार्जितकार्यकरणस्य शरीरान्तरमुपादायिष्यत इति नास्ति तत्र संशयः। अपतितशरीरस्य तु जात्यन्तरपरिणामे किं तदेव कार्यकरणमुपादानमुतान्यदपीति — तत्र कायेन्द्रियाणामन्यजातिपरिणतानां —जात्यन्तरपरिणामःप्रकृत्यापूरात् ॥

 पूर्वपरिणामापाये समवस्थितानामेव पूर्वकार्यकरणानाम् उत्तरपरिणामोपजनः अपूर्वावयवानुप्रवेशेन भवति। कस्मात्? अल्पपरिमाणस्योपादानस्य महापरिमाणकार्यानुपपत्तेः। न हि दशपलात्तपनीयपिण्डादशीतिपला पत्री जनिष्यते ?

 कायेन्द्रियप्रकृतयः स्वं स्वं विकारं कायमिन्द्रियं वा अनुगृह्णन्त्यापूरेण धर्मादिनिमित्तम् आदिग्रहणादधर्ममपि निमित्तम् अपेक्षमाणाः ॥२॥

 Therein perfection is the excellence (supremacy) of the instruments that bring about the effect. In the attainment of (another) birth the instruments of the effect (body) which have been accumulated earlier by the fallen body will be attained by another body (effect); thus there is no doubt whatsoever here[^481].Whereas, in the case of the body which has not fallen, when there is change into another birth, is it only a taking on of the same instruments of the effect (body) or is it something different? “tatra kāyendriyāṇāmanyajātipariṇatānām[^482]”.*jātyantarapariṇāmaḥprakṛtyāpūrāt.*

[^481]: "When there is another body the instruments like accumulated karmāśaya are no more connected with the earlier body, but get connected to the next birth."

[^482]: "Introduction to YS, IV.2."

 “*pūrvapariṇāmāpāye*”. Of the earlier instruments of the effect which are fixed, the coming into being of the later change after the earlier change has disappeared is through “apūrvāvayavānupraveśena bhavati[^483]”(entering the new arrangement of parts). Why is this so? Because a small material cause cannot give rise to an effect of a huge size. It is not possible to create a metal leaf weighing eighty palas[^484]from a hot iron (sheet) weighing ten palas.

[^483]: "In the available readings we have 'anupraveśād' instead of anupraveśena'."

[^484]: "A measurement of weight."

 “kāyendriyaprakṛtayaḥ . . apekṣamāṇāḥ[^485]”= (help) the body or the sense-organ (by a filling-in-process depending on dharma). By the use of the word “ādi[^486]”it is implied that it depends on adharma also as the instrumental cause.

[^485]: "Nothing much is added to the bhāṣya-explanation."

[^486]: "In dharmādi."

**निमित्तमप्रयोजकं प्रकृतीनां वरणभेदस्तु ततः क्षेत्रिकवत् ॥३॥**

 The efficient cause does not impel the creative causes to action, it only removes the obstruction (to the creative causes) and then (the mutation) follows as it happens with the farmer.

** न हि धर्मादि निमित्तं तत्प्रयोजकं प्रकृतीनां भवति। न कार्येण कारणं प्रवर्तते इति। कथं तर्हि, वरणभेदस्तु ततः क्षेत्रिकवत्। यथा क्षेत्रिकः केदारादपां पूर्णात्केदारान्तरं पिप्लावयिषुः समं निम्नं निम्नतरं वा नापः पाणिनापकर्षत्यावरणं त्वासां भिनत्ति, तस्मिन्भिन्ने स्वयमेवापः केदारान्तरमाप्लावयन्ति, तथा धर्मः प्रकृतीनामावरणमधर्मं भिनत्ति, तस्मिन्भिन्ने स्वयमेव प्रकृतयः स्वं स्वं विकारमाप्लावयन्ति।**

 Dharma &c., which has been mentioned as the efficient cause, do not impel the creative causes to action, because the cause is not moved into action by the effect. Then how (does it work) ? In that case it removes the obstruction (similarly) as happens in the case of the farmer. Just as the farmer, desiring to water (irrigate) another field which is on the same level, on a lower level or on a still lower level, from a field which is filled with water does not throw the water (from one field to another) with his hands but breaks the barrier (between them) and when the barrier is broken the water by itself flows into the other field, so also, ‘dharma’removes (breaks) ‘adharma’which is an obstacle to the creative causes. And when that is removed, the creative causes themselves effect their respective changes.

**यथा वा स एव क्षेत्रिकस्तस्मिन्नेव केदारे न प्रभवत्यौदकान्भौमान्वा रसान्धान्यमूलान्यनुप्रवेशयितुम्। किं तर्हि मुद्गगवेधुकश्यामाकादींस्ततोऽपकर्षति। अपकृष्टेषु तेषु स्वयमेव रसा धान्यमूलान्यनुप्रविशन्ति, तथा धर्मा निवृत्तिमात्रे कारणमधर्मस्य, शुद्ध्याशुद्ध्योरत्यन्तविरोधात्। न तु प्रकृतिप्रवृत्तौ धर्मोहेतुर्भवतीति। अत्र नन्दीश्वर प्रभृतय उदाहार्याः। विपर्ययेणाप्यधर्मो धर्मं बाधते। ततश्चाशुद्धिपरिणाम इति। तत्रापि नहुषाजगरादय उदाहार्याः ॥३॥**

 Or, just as, when that same farmer is not capable of injecting the watery and earthy juices into the roots of the corn, but only removes weeds like ‘mudga’, ‘gavedhuka’and ‘śyāmaka’from that place; (and) when they are removed the juice automatically enters the roots of the corn (rice); so also ‘dharma’(virtue) is the cause only for the removal of ‘adharma’(vice) as there is absolute opposition between ‘dharma’and ‘adharma’(purity and impurity). Thus ‘dharma’is not the (direct) cause for bringing about activity in the creative causes.

 In this context the case of Nandīśvara and others are to be cited as examples: (similarly) on the opposite side (one sees that) ‘adharma’(vice) also counteracts ‘dharma’(virtue); and because of that there is an impure mutation. In this context also, the case of Nahuṣa, (who took on the form of) a python and others are to be cited as examples.

  It is said that they help their own respective changes depending on dharma, etc.

 Question—Does it mean then that the instrumental causes of dharma, etc., impel the creative causes (to action) or they do not?

Answer—In that context he says *nimittamaprayojakam prakṛtīnām varaṇabhedastu tataḥkṣetrikavat*. “na hi prakṛtīnām[^841]” = Dharma, etc, do not impel prakṛti to action). Why is this so? Because the cause in the form of that which acts is not moved into action by the effect which is the efficient cause like dharma, etc[^487].

[^487]: "While the VBh. has “pravartate” the Vivaraṇa has “pravartyate”"

[^841]: # "The Vyāsabhāṣya has “tatprayojakam”whereas the Vivaraṇa has just “prayojakam”"

 “katham tarhi”Then how is it moved into action? “varaṇa.. kṣetrikavat”. It is due to the causes (like) dharma, etc., that (the obstacles are removed therein). “yathā. plāvayanti[^488]”.“tathā.. bhinatti”= (dharma removes adharma which is an obstacle). So also, adharma removes dharma which is an obstacle (to the creative causes). “tasmin . . plāvayanti”. (When that is removed the creative causes themselves effect their respective changes.)

[^488]: "Again the readings available in the bhāṣya and Vivaraṇa differ. Thus the VBh. has “tvāsām”whereas’ the Vivaraṇa has “tu tāsām”. The Vivaraṇa does not add anything to what is said in the bhāṣya. So it hasnot been translated again."

 “yathā vā. apakarṣati[^489]”(as the farmer removes the weeds) from the roots of the corn, “apakrstesukāranamadharmasya”(dharma is the cause only for removal of adharma); so also adharma is the cause for removal of dharma. “śuddhasya. udāhāryāh[^490]”.

[^489]: " The Vivaraṇa has “mudgatindukagavīthuka”instead of “mudgagavedhuka” in the bhāṣya."

[^490]: "Instead of “nahuṣājagarādaya” in the bhāṣya the Vivaraṇa has “nahusādaya”. Also instead of “tatra”’ given in the bhāsya the Vivarana has “atra"

**यदा तु योगी बहून्कायान्निर्मिमीते तदा किमेकमनस्कास्ते भवन्त्यथानेकमनस्का इति—**

When the yogīconstructs many bodies then do they all have (just) one mind or do they possess many minds?

**निर्माणचित्तान्यस्मितामात्रात्॥४॥**

Constructed (created) minds are (made) from the I-sense alone.

**अस्मितामात्रं चित्तकारणमुपादाय निर्माणचित्तानि करोति। ततः सचित्तानि भवन्तीति॥४॥**

Taking the ‘I-sense’alone as the cause for the mind, he constructs the created minds. Therefore, the created bodies are possessed of (separate) minds.

यदा तु योगी बहून् कायान्निर्मिमीते, तदा किमेकमनस्कास्ते भवन्ति, अथानेकमनस्का इति समाधिसिद्धौ कश्चिदनुक्तो विशेष उच्यते—निर्माणचित्तान्यस्मितामात्रात्। सोऽहंकारं चित्तकारणमुपादाय निर्माणचित्तानि निर्मितानि चित्तानि अप्राकृतानीश्वरचित्तानि नवानि करोति योगी। चित्तग्रहणमुदाहरणमात्रम्। इन्द्रियाण्यप्यस्मितामात्रादेव। ततः ते सचित्ताःसकरणाश्च भवन्ति॥

चित्तेन्द्रियाभावे च मृतदेशीयः कायो निरर्थकः स्यात्। एकचित्तत्वे तु गुणप्रधानभावः प्रवृत्तिभेदश्च नोपकल्पते।

“yadā tu .anekamanaskā iti[^491]”. In the powers that come by samādhi he mentions something special which has not been dealt with (through the sūtra) *nirmāṇacittānyasmitāmātrāt*. The yogī takes ahaṃkāra as the cause for the mind and new powerless minds are created which are not of prakṛti[^492].Mind has been mentioned only as an example. Even the sense-organs are (created) only from “asmitā”(sense-of-I). “tātaḥ te sacittāḥ bhavanti[^493] and it seems unlikely that the Vivaraṇakāra if it were Ādiśaṅkara would not have noticed it. All available bhāṣya readings have “sacittāni”")”(they) are equipped (with minds) and with instruments of activity.

[^491]: "Introduction to IV.4."

[^492]: "Not created by the creative causes of prakṛti but by the mind of the yogīsupplying the causes. These minds are also not powerful independently."

[^493]: "There is no “te”in the bhāṣya. Moreover grammatically also it should be “tāni”The Vivaraṇa has “sacittāḥ”(in keeping with te

In the absence of mind and sense-organs the body is like a dead body and is not fit for anything. If there is only one mind then one cannot explain the different activities and the relationship (between what is) main and subsidiary obtaining here[^494]. Therein, though having knowledge regarding one body one can understand its commencement of many bodies because it is all-pervading[^495].Different instruments are however desired for the sake of many different main and subsidiary activities.

[^494]: " Main mind being the yogī’s mind and subsidiary minds being the created minds."

[^495]: "Unlike in Nyāya where the mind is considered atomic, yoga believes that the mind is all-pervading."

Some[^496]believe that the jīvas also are different in each body. Some (others believe that) without being close, it impels (the bodies) to activity. Again others state the argument that the jīvas are those whose karma is in keeping with those bodies[^497].

[^496]: "Various opinions regarding the jīva in the created bodies must have been prevalent and some are mentioned here."

[^497]: "It is surprising that the Vivaraṇakāra does not give his own opinion after mentioning the various views on the matter. Another commentator Vijñānanbhikṣu, does try to answer this question. Cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. IV, Kaivalyapāda, pp. 13-15."

**प्रवृत्तिभेदे प्रयोजकं चित्तमेकमनेकेषाम्॥५॥**

 In the presence of different activities, the mind which directs, (impels) the many is one.

**बहूनां चित्तानां कथमेकचित्ताभिप्रायपुरःसरा प्रवृत्तिरिति सर्वचित्तानां प्रयोजकं चित्तमेकं निर्मिमीते, ततः प्रवृत्तिभेदः॥५॥**

How can many minds act in a way which conforms to the desire of a single mind? With this object he makes a single mind the director of all (created) minds. Thence proceeds the difference of activities.

यद्येवं कथं बहूनां चित्तानाम् एकचित्ताभिप्रायपुरस्सरा प्रवृत्तिरिति। तत्रोच्यते—प्रवृत्तिभेदे प्रयोजकं चित्तमेकमनेकेषाम्। प्रवृत्तिभेदे सत्यपि सर्वचित्तानां प्रयोजकं चित्तमेकं फलाधिकृतदेशीयं शरीरान्तरे निर्मिमीते॥

 तच्च योगिबुद्धिमनुवर्तते। अन्यानि च निर्माणचित्तानि भिन्नानेकप्रवृत्तीनि तन्नायकचित्तानुवर्तीनि भवन्ति। ततश्च तेषां प्रवृत्तिः निवृत्तिः उपेक्षा इत्येवमादिप्रवृत्तिभेदः उपपद्यते। राजप्रकृतिप्रवृत्तिभेदवत्। एवमेकचित्ताभिप्रायपुरःसरा च प्रवृत्तिरवकल्पते॥५॥

 If that is so then “katham bahūnām cittānām ekacittābhiprāyapurassarā pravṛttiḥ[^498]”. In that context he (Patañjali) says—*pravṛttibhede prayojakaṃcittamekamanekeṣām.*Though activity is different (he makes the one mind the director of all minds) having in itself the fixed results in the other body[^499].

[^498]: "The bhāṣya under IV.5 asks this question, i.e., how can the one mind of the yogīdirects the activities of many minds."

[^499]: "The controller is the yogī’s mind."

 And that follows the mind of the yogī. The other created minds having various, different activities follow their leader-mind.

“tatśca[^500]”= from that “pravṛttibhedaḥ”= various activities like action, cessation of action, indifference (to action), etc., can be understood, like the different activities of the subjects of a king[^501]. Similarly action is determined conforming to the desire of a single mind.

[^500]: "The bhāṣya has just tataḥ whereas the Vivaraṇa has tataśca."

[^501]: "The king is the director of their actions and so is the yogī’s mind in this case."

**तत्र ध्यानजमनाशयम्॥६॥**

 Of these (five powers) that which is the result of meditation (samādhi) is free from the latent-deposit (of karma).

** पञ्चविधं निर्माणचित्तं जन्मौषधिमन्त्रतपः समाधिजाः सिद्धय इति। तत्र यदेव ध्यानजं चित्तं तदेवानाशयम्। तस्यैव नास्त्याशयो रागादिप्रवृत्तिः। नातः पुण्यपापाभिसंबन्धः क्षीणक्लेशत्वाद्योगिन इति। इतरेषां तु विद्यते कर्माशयः॥६॥**

 The created mind is of five types, as the perfections are the result of birth, medicinal herbs, incantations, austerities, and ‘oneness with the object of meditation (samādhi)’Amongst them, only that mind which is attained by meditation is free from the latent deposit (of karma). That alone has no ‘latent-deposit’(of karma), which causes the manifestation of attachment and so on. Thence there is no connection with virtue and vice because the afflictions of the yogīhave dwindled away. As for the others, however, there exists the latent deposit (of karma).

तत्र ध्यानजमनाशयम्। पञ्चविधं निर्माणचित्तं जन्मौषधिमन्त्रतपस्समाधिसामर्थ्यनिर्मितम्। तत्र तेषु यदेव ध्यानजं चित्तं तदेव अनाशयं क्लेशकर्माशयापवर्जितम्। तस्यैव नास्त्याशयः रागादिप्रवृत्तिः, अतो न पुण्यपापाभिसंबन्धः क्षीणक्लेशत्वाद्योगिनः। 'क्लेशमूलो हि कर्माशयः' इत्युक्तम्। तदभावाच्च कर्माशयानुपपत्तिः। अपरेषां तु जन्मादिसिद्धानां कर्माशयः अक्षीणकेशत्वाद्विद्यते एव॥६॥

*  tatra dhyānajamanāśayam*. “pañcavidham nirmāṇacittam”= (the created mind is of five types) brought about by the efficacy of birth, medicinal herbs, mantras, austerities and samādhi[^502].“tatra”= amongst them “yadeva. anāśayam”= (that mind

[^502]: "Perfections or siddhis come about by five means already mentioned in IV.1."

which is) rid of afflictions and the deposit of karma, “tasyaiva. yoginaḥ[^842]”= (belongs to a yogī). It has been said that *kleśamūlo hi karmāśayaḥ[^503]*.And in its absence[^504]there will be no deposit of karma. In the case of the other (minds) which have come about by birth and so on, it (karmāśaya) is still there since the afflictions have not (as yet) dwindled away.

[^503]: "YS, II. 12. There is no “hi”in the sūtra."

[^504]: "In the absence of kleśas."

[^842]: # "While the bhāṣya has “nātaḥ” the Vivaraṇa has “ato na”The Vivaraṇakāra does not stick to the text meticulously."

**यतः—**

Because—

**कर्माशुक्लाकृष्णं योगिनस्त्रिविधमितरेषाम्॥७॥**

 The yogī’s karma is neither white (bright) nor black (dark); (the karma) of the others is of three kinds.

** चतुष्पदी खल्वियं कर्मजातिः। कृष्णा शुक्लकृष्णा शुक्लाऽशुक्लाकृष्णा चेति। तत्र कृष्णा दुरात्मनाम्। शुक्लकृष्णा बहिःसाधनसाध्या, तत्र परपीडानुग्रहद्वारेणैव कर्माशयप्रचयः। शुक्ला तपःस्वाध्यायध्यानवताम्। सा हि केवले मनस्यायतत्वादबहिः साधना न परान्पीडयित्वा भवति। अशुक्लाकृष्णा संन्यासिनां क्षीणक्लेशानां चरमदेहानामिति। तत्राशुक्लं योगिन एव, फलसंन्यासात्; अकृष्णं चानुपादानात्। इतरेषां तु भूतानां पूर्वमेव त्रिविधमिति॥७॥**

 This ‘karma’class is indeed fourfold—black, white and black, white and neither white nor black. Of these the black belongs to the evil-minded, the white and black is brought about by outer means of attainment. The accumulation of the latent deposit of karma is brought about in this case by means of injury or by means of benefit to others.

 The white belongs to those engaged in austerities, to those who study the sacred texts (and) to those who practise meditation. And since that depends on the mind alone and is not dependent on (any) outer means of attainment, it is not brought about by causing injury to others.

 The neither white nor black belongs to those who have renounced everything, whose afflictions have dwindled away, whose (present) bodies are their last. In that case, because of renouncing the fruits (of deeds), the not-white belongs only to the yogī, and because he does not perform actions it is not black. Whereas all the other living beings have the three kinds mentioned above.

 कुत एतद्योगिन एव न कर्माशयः? इतरेषां त्वस्तीति। यतः कर्माशुक्लाकृष्णं योगिनस्त्रिविधमितरेषाम्। सिद्धासिद्धसामान्यविषयमिदं सूत्रम्॥

 ननु च पूर्वसूत्रमपि सामान्यविषयमेव। न। समाधिसिद्धिस्तुत्यर्थत्वात्। सामान्यविषयत्वे तु समाधिसिद्धिस्तुतिरनुपपन्ना स्यात्। सिद्धिपरिसंख्यानेन तु विशेषविषयत्वे, तुल्यजातीयजन्मादिसिद्धिचतुष्टयसावद्यत्वसंकीर्तनात् समाधिसिद्धेः स्तुतिरुपपद्यते॥

 किं च, जन्मादिसिद्धिसाधनानां कैवल्यार्थताप्रतिषेधश्चार्थादिति विशिष्टविषयमेव पूर्वसूत्रम्। इदं तु सामान्यविषयमेव पूर्वसूत्रहेतुत्वेनोपादानात्॥

 Why is it that only the yogīhas no “karmāśaya” and the others have it? “yataḥ” =*karmāśuklākṛṣnam yoginastrividhamitareṣām*. This sūtra deals generally both with the perfected yogī and one who has not attained perfection in yoga.

 Objection—But then, even the earlier sūtra[^505]dealt with the subject in a general sense.

[^505]: "YS, IV.6."

 Answer—That is not so; as therein the purpose is praise of perfection attained through samādhi. In dealing with something generally, it will not be proper to praise the perfection of samādhi (dhyāna). Since it has the specific mention of perfection as its special subject, the praise of samādhi siddhi fits in by mentioning the defects which the fourfold similar siddhis belonging to birth (in another body), etc., have.

 Moreover, since it means that the accomplishment of perfections like birth (in another body), etc., has the rejection of the purpose of kaivalya, the topic of the earlier sūtra is a special subject. Whereas this (sūtra) deals with a general topic, taken up because of the earlier sūtra[^506].

[^506]: "Because there is mention of “anāśaya”there, the topic has to be dealt with generally in order to make it clear."

चतुष्पदी खल्वियं कर्मजातिः। कृष्णा दुरात्मनां शास्त्रमार्गातिवर्तिदुष्टचेतसामशुद्धतरा। या तु बहिस्साधनसाध्या जायापुत्रपशुयाजकादिनिष्पाद्या सा शुक्लकृष्णा। काऽसौ? यत्र(पर)पीडाऽनुग्रहद्वारेण कर्माशयप्रचयः, सा क्लेशबाहुलकनिष्पादनीयत्वात् कृष्णा च शुक्ला च॥

 “catuspadī. . . jātiḥ[^507]”.“kṛṣṇā durātmanām” = this is very impure and belongs to evil-minded people who do not follow the path mentioned in the śāstras. That which is “bahissādhanasādhyā”= to be accomplished with the help of one’s wife, son, cattle, sacrificial priest, etc., that is “suklakṛṣṇā”= (white and dark); what is that? “yatra... pracayah[^508]”= (where there is accumulation of the deposit of karma by means of injury or benefit to others) that is both dark and white as it brings about many afflictions[^509].

[^507]: "The available reading is “catuṣpadā”whereas the Vivaraṇa has “catuṣpadī”"

[^508]: " The bhāṣya has “tatra”and not “yatra”, while the Vivaraṇa has “yatra”"

[^509]: " Karmāśaya is the basis of the afflictions."

 Objection—But then, since sacrifices like jyotiṣṭoma, etc., have the sanction of the scriptures dealing with sacrifices they are not dark; it is on the other hand, white.

 Answer—That is not so, as the desired (ritualistic) deeds[^510], kāmya (desired), niṣiddha (prohibited) and naimittika (for some specific purpose).")have uncertain (variable) results. And they are themselves responsible for both good and bad (results).

[^510]: " Deeds are classified as nitya (that which is to be done

 Objection—But then as there is approval of its fruits like heaven, etc., it is with apurpose[^511].

[^511]: "The purpose is specified and not vague according to the opponent."

 Answer—That is not so; because there can be the undesirable consequence of even the desire of sexual relationship with another’s wife being a purpose.

 Objection—But as there is the occurrence of evil in such things as relationship with another’s wife and so on[^843]and since action using passion (attachment), etc., is also prohibited it is not similar (the cases are not similar).

[^843]: # "Such evil deeds already have their bad results enumerated. So that cannot be used as an argument says the pūrvapakṣin."

 Answer—That is not so; there is similarity there also. (Even here) lustfulness is prohibited and there is connection with something undesirable. Birth and death which are extremely fearful and which are bound to happen, have both desired and undesired (actions) as their cause. And the conclusion is that because of injury to others there is connection with something undesirable. Therefore, it is proper that it is prohibited.

 अवश्यं हि जन्ममरणद्वयेन विना स्वर्गादिफलमुपभोक्तुं न शक्यम्। तच्चेदस्ति तस्य दुःखरूपत्वादायातं तर्हि ज्योतिष्टोमादीनामुभयात्मकत्वम्। अथ कर्मान्तरमेव प्रतिषिद्धं जन्ममरणारम्भकारणमिति चेन्नतद्भावभावित्वात्। तस्मिन् हि सति जन्ममरणभावात्॥

 अथ तु भवत्पक्षे नित्यमेव कुर्वीत, न जन्ममरणे प्रवर्तेयाताम्। कुर्वत एव ते भवतो नाकुर्वतः। तस्मान्निमित्तत्वमवगम्यते। किं च—येन जन्ममरणमारप्स्यते स्वर्गादौ तत् कर्म यदि जन्मान्तरगतं, तत्रानिर्मोक्षप्रसङ्गः। काम्यप्रतिषिद्धाक्रियायामपि पूर्वजन्मकृतफलस्यावश्यप्रापणीयत्वात्॥

 अथ प्राक्तनजन्मकर्मक्षयार्थानि नित्यानीति चेत्—तन्न—नियमानुपपत्तेः। अनिष्टफलान्येवारब्धकार्याणि पूर्वकर्माणि, न त्विष्टफलानीति(न)नियन्तुं शक्यते। अदृष्टफलेषु हि सत्सु नित्यान्येव कुर्वतोऽपि मोक्षानुपपत्तिर्जन्मारम्भित्वं च॥

 It is certain that without the twofold birth and death one cannot enjoy fruits like residence in heaven, etc. If that comes to him in the form of pain then jyotiṣṭoma and other sacrifices have a twofold character.

 Objection—Then only that action (any action) is prohibited which is the cause for the commencement of birth and death.

 Answer—That is not so; because it is bound to happen in its presence[^512].
When it is present, there is the presence of birth and death.

[^512]: "Action is bound to be there when is alive and vice versa—therefore the presence of the one ensures the presence of the other."

 Objection—Then in your opinion, one should only do the deeds which are prescribed (in the śāstras); then they will not give rise to birth and death[^513]. They (birth and death) will come into being only for one who acts and not for one who does not act.

[^513]: " According to the “karmakāṇḍin”, nityakarma is alone the best."

 Answer—From that one understands the causal relationship. Moreover, that which will give rise to birth and death with reference to heaven[^514]and so on, if that deed is related to another (previous) birth then there will be no liberation, for even if one does not engage in desired and prohibited deeds one is bound to get the fruits of actions done in earlier births.

[^514]: " Even after doing only prescribed deeds, if there is birth and death with the idea of attaining svarga, that is due to the result of earlier deeds in previous births."

 Objection—But the prescribed deeds are for the sake of the removal (of the result) of deeds done in previous births.

 Answer—That is not so; that does not fit the rules. It is not possible to fix the rule so that the earlier deeds having undesirable results alone have their effects started and not those having desired results. When there are results which are unseen[^515],even if one does only the prescribed deeds there need not be liberation and there can be the start of (another) birth.

[^515]: "dharma and adharma are known as adṛṣṭa."

  तत इष्टानामप्युभयहेतुत्वं सिद्धम्। बाह्यसाधनानां कर्मणां पीडानुग्रहरूपत्वात्। न वै खल्वपि नित्येन पूर्वकृतकर्मणामिष्टानां ज्योतिष्टोमादीनां निवृत्तिरुपकल्पते। विरोधाभावात्। अविरोधश्चोभयेषां शुद्धिरूपत्वात्। तन्त्रसिद्धेश्च॥

   अथापि ब्रूयादे(दने)कजन्मारब्धानि कर्माणि जन्मै(कै)कमारभन्ते, नानारब्धकार्यमवशिष्यत इति। तथाऽपि पूर्वजन्मकर्मण इदानीन्तनजन्मफलदानेन क्षयङ्गतत्वादधुनातनजन्मनिष्पादितानामभिनवानामेव काम्यानां स्वर्गफलजन्ममरणदुःखारम्भित्वमिति शुक्लकृष्णरूपापत्तिः॥

 Thence it is established that even desired acts have these two as causes[^516].Deeds which depend on external means of attainment have the form of injury and benefit (to others). Also through the prescribed deeds it is not possible to stop (the result of) desired deeds like jyotiṣṭoma and so on which have been performed earlier. This is so because there is no contradiction between them[^517].And the non-contradiction is because both are pure; and they have the sanction of the tantra (scripture).

[^516]: "Injury and benefit to others."

[^517]: "The idea is that only that which opposes something can destroy it like for instance, dharma and adharma."

  But it can be said that the deeds which have started a single birth[^518] start one life and there is nothing left which has not started its effect. Still the deeds in earlier lives by giving rise to its result in this life have been weakened; thus it is only the new desired deeds which are accomplished in this present life which give rise to the pain of life and death having the result of heaven—thus one gets (deeds which are) both white and black.

[^518]: "The belief is that all the previous karma combine to produce one life—that is why it is called ekabhavika. Cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. II, Sādhanapāda, pp. 44ff."

  From that, as one observes the pain of birthand death and joy in what is called heaven (svarga) we infer the twofold nature of its cause. When that is established we infer that the practice of injury (to animals, etc.) which is prohibited, even if it is for the sake of sacrifice and being done in such sacrifices as agniṣṭoma, etc., is dark. Though meant for the sake of sacrifice, injury is undesired and obtains what is intended for it.

यदुक्तम् — अविशेषेण यच्छास्त्रं शिरोवदिति चोत्तरमिति, तत्र शिरोवदित्येवंजातीयकदृष्टान्तासिद्धत्वम्। अविशेषेण यच्छास्त्रमिति तु होमस्वरूपस्य विरोधाद्बाध्यबाधकत्वमुपपद्यते। हिंसायास्तु विरोधाभावादुभयोर्हेतुत्वं भोजनस्येव सुखशरीरस्थितिद्वयहेतुत्वम्। यथा च तीर्थस्नानस्य ह्लादादृष्टार्थत्वं तथा हिंसाऽप्यनिष्टफलत्वमपरित्यजन्ती महाफलं क्रतुं नैव नाभिनिर्वर्तयति॥

 अथ बाह्यसाधनसाध्यमपि नित्यं केवलं कामसंयोगाभावाच्छुक्लमेवेति चेदेवमुच्यते—न—दोषवत्त्वेन नित्यकाम्यानामविशेषात्। यथा कामिनः काम्यानीति कामसंयोगेन काम्यानां दोषवत्वमेवं कामादिहेतुभूताविद्यादोषवत्त्वमविशिष्टमिति नित्यानामप्युभयात्मकत्वमेव। अविद्यावत्त्वं च नित्येषु प्रवृत्तस्य प्रायश्चित्तनिमित्तोत्पत्तेरवश्यंभावित्वात्॥

 Śāstra which is without qualification is for both, the latter injunction is to be followed, it is like the head is superior; therein like the head there is no similar example which is available. In the sacrifice there is involved this contradiction of not killing and also killing for sacrifice, this mutual contradiction can be explained. That śāstra, without any qualification, of the essence of sacrifice (agniṣṭoma), being contradictory has the relationship of opposer and opposed. As for injury (in the sacrifice) it produces both the results by not being opposed to it, it benefits both, like food which gives both pleasure and maintains the health of the body. Just as a pilgrim centre gives joy and adṛṣṭa similarly injury also without giving up the undesired result does not fail to fulfil the great result of the fruit of the sacrifice.

 Objection—But that which is brought about with the help of external means is also prescribed; by not being associated just with desire it is only white.

 Answer—That is not so, there is no difference between the prescribed deeds and those desired, as they (both) have defects. The desired deeds for one who desires have defects because the desired deeds have connection with desire (for some result); similarly the prescribed deeds have the defect in the form of avidyā which is the cause for desire, etc., thus there is no difference and it is therein both[^844].(That) there is defect in one who does prescribed deeds is proved (by the belief that) results which come about due to expiatory deeds are bound to happen[^519].

[^519]: "This common belief is being ridiculed by the Vivaraṇakāra."

[^844]: # "Nitya and naimittika or kāmya are thus similar in having defects. Thus even nityakarma is not śukla."

 अपि चाविदुष एव सर्वं कर्म। विदुषः कर्मानुत्पत्तेः। विद्वान् हि पुरुषः स्वरूपावस्थानव्यतिरेकेण फलं नाभिमन्यते। स्वरूपमात्रावस्थानं च समस्तव्यापारविरामेण प्रवर्तते। न चैवं विदुषः क्रियाऽनुष्ठानं घटते। न हि स्थलपथेनाभिप्रतिष्ठासमानो जलमार्गाभिप्रस्थानसाधनं नावादिकमनुतिष्ठति॥

ननु (न च) नित्यकाम्ययोरेवं सत्यविशेषः स्यात्। अत्रोच्यते—कामितफल (तन्मात्रं नि)कर्ममात्रनिवृत्तिप्रयोजनत्वान्नित्यानामदोषः। यो हि काम्याद्विनिवृत्तस्तस्य बहुलं कर्मणां कामरहितेन शुद्धेन कर्त्रा कृतत्वादतिशुद्धफलत्वं शुक्लत्वबहुत्वाच्च संस्कारार्थत्वम्। अपि च कामनिवृत्तिरेव महत् फलम्॥

  किं च, नित्यं कुर्वतः किमर्थं करोमि, किं वाऽस्य फलं, के वास्यानुष्ठाने दोषाः, इति सम्यग्दर्शनरूपः परामर्शो जायत इति नित्यस्यास्ति विशेषः। शुक्लकृष्णात्मकत्वं त्वविशिष्टमुभयेषामपि कर्मणाम्। बाह्यसाधनसाधनीयत्वेन परपीडोपपत्तेः। (इति) तस्मादुच्यते॥

 Moreover, all actions (deeds) belongs only to one who is ignorant, as “karma” does not belong to one who knows. One who knows does not think of any result other than abiding in oneself. And abiding in oneself comes into being by withdrawing all activity. In this manner, actions (doing deeds) do not fit one who knows. A person who is travelling by road does not use boats and so on, which are the means of travel in water.

FOOT NOTE 3 IS NOT GETTING SAVED

 Objection—But then, if it is so, there is no difference between deeds that are prescribed and those that are desired (for some result[^845]).

[^845]: # "The opponent then says that if there is no difference between the two then why call them as two - they can be known as the same."

  Answer—As the purpose is cessation of just (those) actions which yield desired results, there is no defect in prescribed deeds. He who is rid of desire, etc., he generally becomes a pure agent of actions devoid of desire; then there is the result which is very pure and because it is greatly white it serves the purpose of subliminal-impressions[^520]. Moreover the cessation of desire is itself the great reward (fruit).

[^520]: "The subliminal-impressions will be mostly white in keeping with its purity."

  Moreover, he who does prescribed deeds reflects in the following manner “for what purpose am I doing this”; “what is the result of this”; “what are the defects in doing these deeds”; which is of the form of right knowledge-thus there is this difference in prescribed **deeds³**.But in the character of being both white and dark there is no difference between the two kinds of deeds. By being brought about through outer means they cause injury (and benefit) to others. Thus it is said “śuklakṛṣṇa” and so on.

  शुक्ला कर्मजातिः तपस्स्वाध्यायध्यानवताम्। सा हि केवले मनस्यायत्तत्वादबहिस्साधना बाह्यसाधनानपेक्षा न परान् पीडयित्वा भवति॥

 “sukla”(the white) collection of deeds belongs to “tapaḥsvādhyāyadhyānavatām” “sā hi. . bhavati”(This karma) is not dependent on external means of attainment.

 “aśuklā . . . dehānām”(In the case of yogīs) who have the single (present) life started, their karma (is not white because of renouncing deeds and not dark) “anupādānāt”= because of not performing any deeds. Nor is (the yogī’s action) a mixture of white and dark (karma) due to renouncing and not performing deeds. Thus it is said—That which is not desired, desired, and mixed, these are the threefold fruits of action which belong to non-yogis after death, but never to the saṃnyāsins (the true yogis).

 “itareṣāmtubhūtānām”= in the case of those having siddhis due to birth, medicinal herbs, mantras, and austerities they have the threefold karma—white, dark and mixed “pūrvamiva”as explained in the second pāda under *kleśamūlaḥ*[^521], etc.

[^521]: "YS, II. 12. The latent deposit of karma has kleśas as its basis and is to be experienced either in a seen or unseen life."

ततस्तद्विपाकानुगुणानामेवाभिव्यक्तिर्वासनानाम्॥८॥

 As a result of this there is manifestation of only those subliminal-impressions which correspond to the fruition of their (karma).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**3.** In "kāmyakarma" the desire for an object is clear and it is binding and not elevating.

 **तत इति त्रिविधात्कर्मणः। तद्विपाकानुगुणानामेवेति। यज्जातीयस्य कर्मणो यो विपाकस्तस्यानुगुणा या वासनाः कर्मविपाकमनुशेरते तासामेवाभिव्यक्तिः। न हि दैवं कर्म विपच्यमानं नारकतिर्यङ्मनुष्यवासनाभिव्यक्तिनिमित्तं संभवति। किं तु दैवानुगुणा एवास्य वासना व्यज्यन्ते। नारकतिर्यङ्मनुष्येषु चैवं समानश्चर्चः॥८॥**

 ‘As a result of this’(tataḥ) means as a result of the threefold karma. ‘Of those which correspond to the fruition of their (karma)’means that ‘whatever is the fruition of whichever class of karma, only those subliminal-impressions which are capable of bringing about the fruition of that karma, are manifested.When ‘karma’relating to the gods is fructifying it cannot be the cause for manifesting the subliminal-impressions relating to the hell-born, to the animals (or) to human beings. On the other hand, it is only those subliminal-impressions which correspond to the state of the gods which are manifested. And this reasoning is the same with reference to the hell-born, the animal and human (subliminal-impressions).

  कैवल्यस्य प्रस्तुतत्वात् तस्य च प्रतिबन्धहेतवः क्लेशाः, कर्माणि, वासानाश्च, (व्याख्यातव्याः)। क्लेशानां तु व्यापारः, प्रतिपक्षः, निवृत्तिश्च तेषां विस्तरेण व्याख्याताः। एवं कर्मणामपि वासनानां तुल्यव्यापारावस्थानप्रतिपक्षनिवृत्तयो निर्वर्णनीया इत्यत उत्तराणि सूत्राण्यारभ्यन्ते—यतस्तन्निवृत्तौ कैवल्यमुपपद्यते नान्यथा। ततस्तद्विपाकानुगुणानामेवाभिव्यक्तिर्वासनानाम्॥

  As kaivalya is mentioned, one has to explain the causes for its obstruction, such as the afflictions, deeds and latent-impressions. The activity of the afflictions, opposition (to them), their cessation, are all to be explained in detail. Similarly, in case of the actions also, one has to describe in detail how they are sustained by similar action and are destroyed by opposition (to them). Therefore these later sūtras are begun, as it is only when they[^846]disappear will kaivalya come into being and not otherwise.*tatastadvipākānuguṇānāmevābhivyaktirvāsanānām*.

[^846]: # "Action and the latent-impressions."

* tataḥ*= Therefore, due to the threefold character of karma already mentioned[^522]in the form of dark, white and mixed, since it (karma) becomes the cause, as it bears fruit *tatvipākānuguṇānām* = there is the fruit of that same karma (and) there is the manifestation of only those (latent-impressions) which correspond to it.

[^522]: "Mentioned in IV.7."

  It is thus said-amongst the deeds which are the causes for birth as gods, animals and human beings, (those subliminal-impressions corresponding to the fruition of a similar class of karma) give rise to (that fruition of karma) and “tāsāmevābhivyaktiḥ[^523]”, this is because it is equipped with that fruition of karma which is similar to it[^524].

[^523]: "The available readings have “yo vipākaḥ” whereas the reading here is “yādṛśo vipākaḥ”."

[^524]: "That impression can give rise to action which is similar to it. One can almost say, in modern language, that it is programmed to give rise to similar action."

 This is like a child running towards somebody who resembles its mother. There is no manifestation of others (other actions) which do not correspond to those (subliminal-impressions which have reached fruition ).

 न हि दैवं कर्म विपच्यमानं फलाभिमुखीभावमापद्यमानं नारकतिर्यङ्मनुषवासनाभिव्यक्तिनिमित्तं(सं) भवति। निमित्तनैमित्तिकयोः प्रतिनियतानुगुणत्वात्। किं तु दैवानुगुणा एवास्याभिव्यज्यन्ते। नारकतिर्यङ्मानुषेष्वेवं समानश्चर्चः समाधिः॥

 नारके कर्मणि विपच्यमाने तत्कर्मानुगुणा वासनाः प्रादुर्भवन्ति। तथा तैर्यग्योनकर्मणि विपच्यमाने तद्विपाकानुरूपा वासना व्यज्यन्ते। तथा मानुषेऽपि समानो न्यायः। न हि स्वविपाकसदृशीरनुपादाय वासनास्तस्य तस्य कर्मणो विपाकः संभवति। नापि वासनानामात्मनिष्पादकविपाकारम्भिकर्मतुल्यरूपाणि कर्मान्तराणि विपाकाभिमुखान्यन्तरेणाभिव्यक्तिः। एवं कर्मणां वासनानां च परस्परहेतुहेतुमद्भावोऽनादिभूतः॥८॥

 “na hi . . bhavati[^525]”,i.e., those which have reached a stage of fruition is “vipacyamānam”This is so because there is the fixed rule of connection between cause and effect. “kim tu . samānaścarcaḥ[^526].”(The argument is the same for other subliminal-impressions.)

[^525]: "As this has already been translated under the bhāṣya and there is nothing new added, the translation is not given."

[^526]: "In the available readings we have “vyajyante”whereas here we have “abhivyajyante”"

 When deeds relating to hell are fructifying subliminal-impressions corresponding to those actions arise. Similarly, when deeds relating to an animal’s birth are fructifying, subliminal-impressions corresponding to that fruition are manifested. The reasoning is the same when it refers to birth as a human being. Without having subliminal- impressions which are similar to one's own fruition of deeds[^527], it is not possible for those respective deeds to attain fruition[^528]. Nor can there be the manifestation of other actions which have a form similar to action started by the fruition of the latent impressions which have the fulfilment of its own purpose. Thus, the mutual relationship of cause and effect between deeds and latent impressions is beginningless.

[^527]: "Fruition in the form of birth, span of life and experiences, already mentioned in the Sādhanapāda.Cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. II, Sādhanapāda, pp. 42 ff."

[^528]: "The action takes place with the presence of the latent-impression and that has to correspond to the particular birth."

**जातिदेशकालव्यवहितानामप्यानन्तर्यं स्मृतिसंस्कारयोरेकरूपत्वात्॥९॥**

 There is uninterrupted, sequential relation (of subliminal-impressions) even when separated by birth, by space and by time, by reason of the correspondence between memory and subliminal-impressions.

 **वृषदंशविपाकोदयः स्वव्यञ्जकाञ्जनाभिव्यक्तः। स यदि जातिशतेन वा दूरदेशतया वा कल्पशतेन वा व्यवहितः पुनश्च स्वव्यञ्जकाञ्ञ्जन एवोदियाद् द्वागित्येवं पूर्वानुभूतवृषदंशविपाकाभिसंस्कृता वासना उपादाय व्यज्येत। कस्मात्? यतो व्यवहितानामप्यासां सदृशं कर्माभिव्यञ्जकं निमित्ती भूतमित्यानन्तर्यमेव।**

 The fruition of action (which results) in the birth as a cat takes place by virtue of the powers (subliminal-impressions) which cause their appearance. Even if that (birth)

is separated by a hundred (different kinds of) birth, or by distance in space or by a hundred ‘kalpas’, even then, it will rise in keeping with the conditions which cause its own manifestation; this will rise (appear) in a moment by taking on the subliminal-impressions present in the mind of a previously experienced life as a cat. Why is this so? Because, even when these (subliminal-impressions) are separated (by an interval), the (latent-deposit of) ‘karma’which is the cause for its manifestation, is similar; therefore, there is an uninterrupted (causal) relation.  

 **कुतश्च? स्मृतिसंस्कारयोरेकरूपत्वात्। यथानुभवास्तथा संस्काराः। ते च कर्मवासनानुरूपाः, यथा च वासनास्तथा स्मृतिरिति जातिदेशकालव्यवहितेभ्यः संस्कारेभ्यः स्मृतिः, स्मृतेश्च पुनः संस्काराः इत्येवमेते स्मृतिसंस्काराः कर्माशयवृत्तिलाभवशाद्व्यज्यन्ते। अतश्च व्यवहितानामपि निमित्तनैमित्तिकभावानुच्छेदादानन्तर्यमेव सिद्धमिति॥९॥**

 Why is this so? Because there is a correspondence between memory and subliminal-impressions. The subliminal-impressions are in keeping with experiences; and these are in keeping with the subliminal-impressions of the deposit of karma; and as are the subliminal-impressions so is memory; and memory arises from subliminal-impressions even though separated by birth, by space and by time. And from memory there again arise subliminal-impressions. Thus, in this way, memory and subliminal-impressions are manifested by virtue of the fact that there is modification of the mind due to the latent deposit of karma. Therefore, even though separated (by birth &c.) because the relationship of cause and effect is not broken, it is proved that there is an uninterrupted sequential relation between them.

 तत्र वासनानामनेकजातिकालदेशव्यवधानेन दवीयसीनामानन्तर्यं विपच्यमानेन कर्मणा सह नास्ति। यथा दवीयसां मित्रस्वजनादीनाम्। यथैव च नेदीयसी वासना पटीयसी, न तथा दवीयसी पटीयमानमासीदति। तस्मान्नास्ति दवीयसीनामानन्तर्यं वासनानाम् ॥

 तदभावे चायं दोषः प्राप्नोति—यथा कल्पशतान्तरितः वृषदंशविपाकः भविष्यतः वृषदंशविपाकस्यानन्तरातीतो दैवविपाकः। तत्र नेदीयसी दैववासना विरुद्धत्वात् वृषदंशविपाकाभिव्यक्तिहेतुतां न प्रतिपद्यते। कल्पशतव्यवहितानामपि वृषदंशवासनानां विप्रकर्षादनुपादाने वृषदंशविपाकहेतोः कर्मणो विपाको नावकल्पेत। ततश्च कर्मणां वासनानां चानर्थक्यं प्रसज्येतेति ॥

 In that context the distant latent-impressions being separated by many lives, space and time, do not have an uninterrupted connection with the deeds (karma) which are about to fructify, just as in the case of distant friends and one's relatives. Just as a latent-impression which is nearer is more proficient a distant one is not so proficient[^529]. Therefore, there is no uninterrupted connection of distant latent-impressions (with the fruit-giving karma).

[^529]: "Proficient in bringing about its result."

 And in their absence the following defect comes into being—when after a hundred kalpas the fruition of a cat's karma is to come about, the fruition of divine exist-

ence has just ended immediately before the fruition of the cat’s karma[^530].There the latent-impressions of a life relating to the gods which are nearby condradict (the latent impressions that belong to a cat’s life); therefore, they do not become the cause/ causes for manifestation of the fruition of karma of a cat's life. The latent-impressions of karma of a cat’s life, though separated by a hundred kalpas, if not acceptedwill not be able to explain the fruition of that karma which is the cause for the fruition of a cat's life. Then there will be the undesirable consequence of actions and their latent impressions being meaningless. In this context, he (Patañjali) says
-*jātideśakālavyavahitānāmapyānantaryam smṛtisaṇskārayorekarūpatvāt*.

[^530]: "Right after a divine life, one would expect something similar. But according to the theory of the beginningless existence of latent-impressions there is no contradiction in a cat's life coming into being right after that of a human life or divine life."

  “vṛṣadamśavipākādayaḥ”^(**2**).

  (The lives) are manifested by one’s own deeds which manifest them.

 Objection—But then, the passage of time is already indicated by the mention of uninterrupted lives, so why is time mentioned (separately[^531] separately mentioned asks the opponent.")).

[^531]: "In the sūtra jāti could have been sufficient to indicate the lapse of time also. So why is time (kāla

 Answer—Even in a single day many lives come into being, as for instance, in the case of insignificant creatures, etc. In such instances there is no remoteness indicated by past time—therefore he mentions time (in the sūtra).

 The fruition of a cat's life which has taken place earlier also, through its manifesting causes, again (in a moment by taking on the latent impressions present in the mind of a previously experienced life as a cat manifests itself now). “kasmāt”(why is this) like this? “yato . . . bhūtamiti”

The Vivaraṇakāra also shows his carelessness by quoting "kalpasahasreṇa" instead of “kalpaśatena" There is not much of any independent explanation offered by the Vivaraṇakāra here.

be the cause for manifestation of the latent-impressions of a cat’s life—as these are not similar. The cause for manifestation is correspondence (between the two). When one sees food like ‘āmla’, etc., the tongue salivates[^532]. Therefore, there is uninterrupted continuity of the latent-impressions; therefore, there is a similarity in the manifestation[^533]. When it is like that, it does not matter whether the latent-impressions are nearer or further away (from its fruition), as the mind which is the support is the same. “kutaśca” (Why is this so)? This again is another reason for uninterrupted relationship. (This is so because) “smṛti . . . patvāditi”

[^532]: "There is thus a relationship between the food and saliva flow in the mouth."

[^533]: "A cat's action and latent-impressions will give rise to only a cat's life and none other."

 He has first mentioned the uninterrupted latent-impressions which are the cause for manifestation of actions which are similar to the birth taken. He now mentions another (reason) (through the words) “yathā anubhavāstathā saṃskārāḥ” The latent-impressions are in keeping with the thoughts (and they are in keeping with latent-impressions); memories are also in keeping with latent-impressions. Thus it is said “grahyoparaktaḥ pratyayo grāhyagrahaṇobhayākāranirbhāsaḥ[^534]”.

[^534]: "This is not found in available readings. Similar ideas are specifically expressed under YS, I.41, 42. as also under YS, III. 17. But these exact words are not there. Their connection perhaps is the nature of the latent-impressions. But that has not been developed fully and so seems to be unconnected here."

 “jātideśa.. vyajyante[^535]”. It has been indicated that the latent deposit of karma attains the state of modification of the mind depending upon such causes as place, etc., (time, birth, etc.).

[^535]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything new to what the bhāṣya says in this connection."

 “ataśca . . siddham”Memory corresponds to subliminal-impressions. As their manifestation is mutually fixed[^536], remoteness is not a cause for them (not to be related). Thus even from a subliminal-impression, though removed by a hundred kalpas, similar memory arises. Thus uninterrupted continuity is established.’

[^536]: "'The one depending on the other and being similar to it."

**तासामनादित्वं चाशिषो नित्यत्वात्॥१०॥**

 And these (subliminal-impressions) are without beginning because the desire (to live ) is permanent.

** तासां वासनानामाशिषो नित्यत्वादनादित्वम्। येयमात्माशीः न भूवं भूयासमिति सर्वस्य दृश्यते सा न स्वाभाविकी। कस्मात्? जातमात्रस्य जन्तोरननुभूतमरणधर्मकस्य द्वेषदुःखानुस्मृतिनिमित्तो**

**मरणत्रासः कथं भवेत्? न च स्वाभाविकं वस्तु निमित्तमुपादत्ते। तस्मादनादिवासनानुविद्धमिदं चित्तं निमित्तवशात्काश्चिदेव वासनाः प्रतिलभ्य पुरुषस्य भोगायोपावर्तत इति।**

 These subliminal-impressions are without beginning because the desire (to live) is permanent. This desire pertaining to oneself as ‘May I not cease to be, may I be (live on)’is found in everyone; (and) this is not an innate disposition, (spontaneous). Why is this so? How could there be fear of death caused by memory of pain in the form of hatred in any being who is just born and has had no experience of death?

 Moreover a thing which is an innate disposition (natural) does not stand in need of a cause. Therefore, this mind which is possessed of beginningless subliminal-impressions, taking hold of certain subliminal-impressions due to the operation of efficient causes, returns (presents itself) for the experiences of the self (puruṣa).

 **घटप्रासादप्रदीपकल्पं संकोचविकासि चित्तं शरीरपरिमाणाकारमात्रमित्यपरे प्रतिपन्नाः। तथा चान्तराभावः संसारश्च युक्त इति।**

** वृत्तिरेवास्य विभुनश्चित्तस्य संकोचविकासिनीत्याचार्यः।**

** तच्च धर्मादिनिमित्तापेक्षम्।**

 Some philosophers say that the mind which expands and contracts is commensurate to the size of the body: it is similar to the light of a lamp (which contracts if) placed in a pot or (which expands if) placed in a palace. Only then is it possible to explain its absence in between (the time of dissolution) and its worldly existence. The ācārya (Patañjali) holds that it is only the modifications of this all-pervading mind that contracts and expands (according to the size of the body). And this (modification) is dependent on efficient causes like ‘dharma’&c.

 **निमित्तं च द्विविधम् — बाह्यमाध्यात्मिकं च। शरीरादिसाधनापेक्षं बाह्यं स्तुतिदानाभिवादनादि। चित्तमात्राधीनं श्रद्धाद्याध्यात्मिकम्। तथा चोक्तम् — ये चैते मैत्र्यादयो ध्यायिनां विहारास्ते बाह्यसाधननिरनुग्रहात्मानः प्रकृष्टं धर्ममभिनिर्वर्तयन्ति। तयोर्मानसं बलीयः। कथम्? ज्ञानवैराग्ये केनातिशय्येते? दण्डकारण्यं च चित्तबलव्यतिरेकेण कः शारीरेण कर्मणा शून्यं कर्तुमुत्सहेत? समुद्रमगस्त्यवद्वा पिबेत्?॥१०॥**

 And the efficient cause is of two kinds—external and that which pertains to the self (internal). External is that which depends on such instruments as the body &c., (for its accomplishment); these are praise, alms-giving, salutations &c. That pertaining to the soul (internal) is dependent only on the mind—these are faith &c. Thus it has been said—‘These actions which are effortless like friendliness &c., of the contemplative yogins are not in need of external means (instruments); they (also) bring into being superior dharma.’

  Of the two (means) the mental (internal) one is superior. How (is this so)? What can excel knowledge and detachment? Who can attempt to empty the ‘daṇḍaka’forest by bodily effort without the power of the mind; or (who can) drink the waters of the ocean like Agastya (without the power of the mind)?

 Now he points out the working out of the results of the latent-impressions due to their being beginningless, (and) in order to attain detachment he indicates how the latent-impressions are beginningless and each one is made to go through countless births . . . *tāsāmanāditvam cā*’*śiṣo nityatvāt*.

 “tāsām ... svābhāvikī[^537].”Though this desire is natural and fixed it is not an innate disposition. “kasmāt bhavet[^538]”?Nowhere does an innate disposition stand in need of a cause like the memory of pain (of death, etc.); “na ca ... datte”; the innate heat of a burning flame exists in itself, it does not require some cause for its own effect.

[^537]: "Again there are many variant readings in the Vivaraṇa text. Instead of “mā na bhūvam”in the available readings we get “maraṇam mā nu bhūt”."

[^538]: "Instead of “ananubhūtamaraṇadharmakasya”the Vivaraṇa has “ananubhūtajananamaraṇa-dharmakasya”."

 No one will be troubled by memory of something which has not been experienced, whether it is desired or not desired. In the memory of pleasant things that have been experienced there is no longing for those objects; similarly in the memory of unpleasant things also one does not see, in the world, hatred and fear pertaining to those objects[^539].

[^539]: "Memory is plain memory without being attached to the object or hating the object of memory."

 Therefore the desire(to live forever) of whoever is born (in this world), who has not experienced, in this life, both birth and death[^540]point to another previous life. Therefore, because that desire (to live forever) is permanent, the experience of previous birth and death is inferred; (so also one infers a life) previous to that, and again another previous to that[^541]thus we infer that memory and the subliminal-impressions and its causes, the experience of life and death, are beginningless.

[^540]: "One would think that once a person is born he has experienced birth and can therefore have its memory."

[^541]: "The previous birth by the same logic will point to a life previous to it and again another previous to that and so on."

    In a similar way it is established that each living being goes through many births. Thus these latent-impressions are difficult to get rid of and cannot be stopped. Why it so? “yasmād. vartate[^847]”. (Therefore), due to the operation of karma (karmāśaya) (taking hold of some latent-impressions), the karma which is fructifying accomplish fruition of similar actions (returning for the sake of experience of puruṣa), till such time as its power ends[^542].

[^542]: " Till such time as the kleśas are there karma has the power to accomplish this, not afterwards."

[^847]: # "Instead of “tasmād”the Vivaraṇa has “yasmād”"

  And (the size of) this mind[^543] for the latent-impressions.")“ghaṭa. . ākāram”, is commensurate to the size of the elephant or the mosquito[^544]just as a lamp in a pot, a palace and so on[^545]; thus it is said by some[^546].He mentions the reasoning in that context as “tathā ca” and so on. Thus, when there is contraction and expanse “yuktam[^547]”=it is proper to speak of “antarābhāvaḥ-existence in the interval after death and before birth[^548].“saṃsaraṇam”is movement, i.e., that through which there is movement; when it is not all-pervading (it is proper that) the mind is restricted to the body (does not exceed the body).

[^543]: "This mind which is the basis (support

[^544]: "The size of the mind in an elephant's case is like that of an elephant and in the case of a mosquito,like that of a mosquito. It expands and shrinks according to the size of the body say some."

[^545]: "The light of a lamp in the pot pervades the entire pot, so also does the light when the lamp is inside a huge room. Thus its expanse is decided by the receptacle."

[^546]: "Refers to Jainas probably."

[^547]: "The bhāṣya has “yuktaḥ” in keeping with saṃsāraḥ whereas the Vivaraṇa has “yuktaṃ”to go with“saṃsaraṇañca”"

[^548]: " If it is atomic or all-pervading its existence during the interval between two creations is difficult to explain."

  “vṛttirevāsya . . . ācāryaḥ”

 The mention of the preceptor is to indicate respect as it is proper to do so.

 Even though the mind is all-pervading it has changes like steadiness and movement which is properly understood as of the sense-organs; and the omniscience of the yogīs which is a state of modification, fits its all-pervasiveness[^549].

[^549]: "It is the modifications which contract and expand according to the size of the body. The mind being vibhu, should normally know everything which happens when rajas and tamas of the mind are weakened and it becomes pure sattva. Then it regains its vibhutva and the yogī has omniscience as a result."

 There is no authority in imagining a carrier body which is devoid of any enjoyment (experience), as it is something not seen like a hare's horn and so on. This is known from the following scriptural statement[^550].

[^550]: "Not traced. The Vivaraṇakāra does not explain it either."

 Similarly the following scriptural statement indicates its instrumentality[^551].

[^551]: "Not traced. The Vivaraṇakāra adds no explanation either."

 तच्च संकोचविकासित्वं वृत्तेः धर्मादिनिमित्तापेक्षम्। निमित्तं च द्विधा बाह्यमाध्यात्मिकं च। शरीरादिसाधनापेक्षं बाह्यं स्तुत्यभिवादनादि कर्म। किं पुनराध्यात्मिकम् ? आह–केवलचित्तमात्राधीनं श्रद्धादि॥

 तथा चोक्तम्—ये चैते मैत्र्यादयो ध्यायिनां विहाराःचित्तव्यापाराःचेष्टितानि ते बाह्यसाधननिरनुग्रहाः बाह्यसाधननिरपेक्षाः केवलचित्तमात्रनिर्वृत्ताः प्रकृष्टं धर्ममभिनिर्वर्तयन्ति॥

 तयोः बाह्याध्यात्मिकयोर्निमित्तयोः मानसम् आध्यात्मिकं मैत्र्यादिचित्ताभिनिष्पन्नं निमित्तं बलीयः। कथम् इति? ज्ञानवैराग्ये केनातिशय्येते? न केनापीत्यर्थः। यतस्तृतीयपादानुक्रान्तविभूतिजातं ज्ञानवैराग्यसाध्यम्। दण्डकारण्यं चित्तबलव्यतिरेकेण कः कर्तुं शक्नोति। कञ्च पिबेत् समुद्रमगस्त्यवत् इति। अतो मानसबलमेव बलम्। न शारीरम्। “तस्मात् मानसं परमं वदन्ति” इति श्रुतेः। तथा च भगवानावभाषे—

 “श्रेयान् द्रव्यमयाद्यज्ञाज्ज्ञानयज्ञः परन्तप।”  
 “सर्वं कर्माखिलं पार्थ ज्ञाने परिसमाप्यते” इति॥१०॥

 And that contraction and expansion of the modification is dependent on the efficient causes like dharma, etc. “nimittam . . . nādi[^51]”. (Action such as praise, alms-giving, etc.) And what is that pertaining to the self? He says that here there is dependence only on the mind like faith, etc.

 Thus it is said “ye caite . . . vihārāḥ”= (these) operations of the mind, i.e., actions “bāhyasādhananiranugrahāḥ[^553]”= are independent of external means (of fulfilment); they are accomplished just by the mind (and bring about superior dharma).

[^553]: "The available reading in the bhāṣya is “anugrahātmānaḥ” instead of “niranugrahāḥ” in the Vivaraṇa."

 “tayoḥ” = of the two causes which are external and internal respectively, “mānasam”= the cause pertaining to the self, i.e., that which is accomplished by feelings of friendliness, etc., is “balīyaḥ”(superior). How is this so? (Because) “jñānavairāgye.. yyete”It (knowledge and detachment) cannot be excelled by anything. Therefore the group of perfections (powers) enumerated in the third chapter can be attained by knowledge and detachment[^554].

[^554]: "This establishes the superiority of knowledge."

 “daṇḍakāraṇyam ... pibet[^555]”.Therefore mental strength is alone strength and not bodily (strength). Thus there is the scriptural statement “Therefore mental strength is said to be superior.”So also Bhagavān (Kṛṣṇa) says, “O Arjuna, sacrifice with knowledge is superior to sacrifice with a lot of material offerings. All action, O Kuntī’s son, finally ends in knowledge[^556].”

[^555]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not quote the bhāṣya text verbatim in the order given, as already mentioned earlier."

[^556]: "Bha. Gītā, YS, IV. 11."

**हेतुफलाश्रयालम्बनैः संगृहीतत्वादेषामभावे तदभावः॥११॥**

 Since (subliminal-impressions) are dependent on cause, fruit (result), substratum and object of support, if these cease to be, then those also cease to be.

**हेतुर्धर्मात्सुखमधर्माद्दुःखं सुखाद्रागो दुःखाद्वेषस्ततश्च प्रयत्नस्तेन मनसा वाचा कायेन वा परिस्पन्दमानः परमनुगृह्णात्युपहन्ति वा। ततः पुनर्धर्माधर्मौ सुखदुःखे रागद्वेषाविति प्रवृत्तमिदं षडरं संसारचक्रम्। अस्य च प्रतिक्षणमावर्तमानस्याविद्या नेत्री मूलं सर्वक्लेशानामित्येष हेतुः।**

  Cause (is described as follows):

 From virtue comes pleasure and from vice comes pain; from pleasure there is attachment and from pain aversion; from this proceeds action; due to this exerting either through the mind or through speech or through the body one either helps (favours) or hurts (injures) another. Thence, there again results virtue and vice, pleasure and pain, attachment and aversion; thus revolves this six-spoked wheel of existence.

The impeller of this (wheel) which is continuously revolving is ‘avidyā' (nescience); it (avidyā) is the basis of all the afflictions; thus it is the cause.

 **फलं तु यमाश्रित्य यस्य प्रत्युत्पन्नता धर्मादेः, नह्यपूर्वोपजनः। मनस्तु साधिकारमाश्रयो वासनानाम्। न ह्यवसिताधिकारे मनसि निराश्रया वासनाः स्थातुमुत्सहन्ते। यदभिमुखीभूतं वस्तु यां वासनां व्यनक्ति तस्यास्तदालम्बनम्। एवं हेतुफलाश्रयालम्बनैरेतैः संगृहीताः सर्वा वासनाः। एषामभावे तत्संश्रयाणामपि वासनानामभावः॥११॥**

 Whereas fruit (result) is that, depending on which ‘dharma’&c., reveals itself. There is no coming into being of something which is not in existence. The mind which is still operative (has not fulfilled its purpose), is the substratum of the subliminal-impressions. In a mind which has fulfilled its purpose, it is not possible for the ‘substratum less’subliminal-impressions to exist. As for support: That (particular) subliminal-impression which is manifested in the presence of a (particular) object is the support of that (particular) subliminal-impression.

 Thus all the subliminal-impressions are dependent on cause, fruit, substratum and support. In the disappearance of these there is the disappearance of the subliminal-impressions which are dependent on them.

 कथं पुनस्तासां वासनानां निवृत्तिः। अनादिरूढत्वात् न निवृत्तिरासां घटामाढौकते। न च तन्निवृत्तिमन्तरेण कैवल्योपपत्तिरित्यत उच्यते—हेतुफलाश्रयालम्बनैः संगृहीतत्वादेषामभावे तदभावः। हेतुश्च फलं चाश्रयश्चालम्बनं च हेतुफलाश्रयालम्बनानि। तैः संगृहीतत्वादुपग्रथितत्वादेषां हेत्वादीनामभावे तदभावे वासनानामभावः। तस्मादुपपद्यते वासनानां निवृतिः॥

   How can there be the cessation of those latent-impressions? As they are in existence from beginningless time their cessation is problematic. And without their cessation kaivalya cannot come into being—thus he says *hetuphalāśrayālaṃbanaiḥ saṃgṛhītatvādeṣāmabhāve tadabhāvaḥ.*

 The analysis of *hetuphalāśrayālaṃbanaiḥ* is cause and fruit (result) and substratum and object of support is *hetuphalāśrayālaṃbanāni*. As they (latent-impressions) are held by them, i.e., bound by them *eṣāmabhāve* when there is absence of cause, etc., i.e., in their absence there is the absence of latent-impression.

 Therefore the cessation of latent-impressions is relevant.

 What is this cause? He says-dharma belongs to those minds which are bent low by avidyā[^848]. And from dharma there is “sukham”. sukhānuśayī rāgaḥ[^557] pleasure."). Similarly from avidyā itself by engaging in prohibited deeds, there is adharma; and from that comes “duḥkham”. *duḥkhānuśayī dveṣaḥ[^558] pain.")*.

[^557]: "YS, II.7. Attachment is that which follows (experience of

[^558]: "YS, II.8. Aversion is that which follows (experience of

[^848]: # "Which are under the influence of avidyā and other kleśas."

 And then as before there is “prayatnaḥ” (action) in acquiring pleasure and in avoiding pain. By that action “vacā. . . hanti ca[^559]”. Then again from that, through favouring or hurting others, there is “dharmādharmau”’From them (again) “sukhaduḥkhe” And from them “rāgadveṣau” as earlier. And thence (again) action. In this manner the continuous revolution of (this six spoked saṃsāra wheel) is begun. And (of this continuously revolving wheel) “avidyā netrī”= (avidyā) is like the mare of the chariot’s wheel[^560].

[^559]: "This has not been translated as there is nothing new added to the bhāṣya."

[^560]: "Unless the horse moves, the wheel of the chariot will stay put. In that sense it is the prime mover of the chariot wheel."

 “sā mūlam. nāmiti”since this six-spoked-wheel has avidyā as its impeller (leader) “esa hetuḥ”= (it is the cause) of the latent-impressions. They are the creations of the revolutions of this wheel. In the absence of avidyā, like the dried up umbilical cord the wheel, i.e., the wheel which is the cause of dharma and so on, also dries up. And when that is dried the latent-impressions brought into being by the revolving wheel are incapable of bringing about their effect.

 “phalam tu”= that which depending on something else brings about the result is the result of that. And that is also the collector of latent-impressions[^561]; because in its absence there is no manifestation of latent-impressions. For instance the result of pleasure, etc., depends on latent-impressions. “na hyapūrvopajanaḥ”= that which is absolutely non-existent cannot come into existence.

[^561]: "Results like dharma, etc. will lead to the latent-impressions which will lead to action and the whole cycle is repeated. In that way the result is a collector of vāsanās."

 The mind having something (action) to be done is not devoid of a goal[^849]. (The mind having) knowledge of the accomplishment of the goal of puruṣa has avidyā turned back[^562];thus “sādhikāram vāsanānām''. It is only by having that (sādhikāram manaḥ) as support, is there the revolving of the causal wheel. “na hyavasitādhikāre utsahante”—when there is absence of any goal to be achieved (there are no vāsanas).

[^562]: "Avidyā is not part of it any more when the goal of puruṣa in the form of apavarga has been fulfilled."

[^849]: # "There is still something to be done and the purpose of puruṣa has not been fulfilled."

 “yadabhi vāsanāḥ[^563]”. In the absence of cause, etc., there is the absence of the latent-impressions which are dependent on them just as in the absence of the umbrella there is the disappearance of shade.

[^563]: "Nothing new has been added as explanation here, by the Vivaraṇakāra."

 The means for their disappearance (absence) has been explained in the second pāda[^564]. Therefore when there is right knowledge (insight), latent-impressions is not an obstruction to liberation. When avidyā ceases, kaivalya definitely comes into being.

[^564]: "YS, II.24-28."

**नास्त्यसतः संभवः, न चास्ति सतो विनाश इति द्रव्यत्वेन संभवन्त्यः कथं निवर्तिष्यन्ते वासना इति—**

 There is no coming into being of that which does not exist and there is no destruction of that which exists-then how can the subliminal-impressions which have existence in the form of substances cease to exist (disappear).

**अतीतानागतं स्वरूपतोऽस्त्यध्वभेदाद्धर्माणाम्॥१२॥**

 Due to temporal distinction of the characteristics, there is in essence the existence of ‘the past’and ‘the not-as-yet-manifest’

 भविष्यद्व्यक्तिकमनागतम्, भूतव्यक्तिकमतीतम्, स्वव्यापारोपारूढं वर्तमानम्। त्रयं चैतद्वस्तु ज्ञानस्य ज्ञेयम्। यदि चैतत् स्वरूपतो नाभविष्यन्नेदं निर्विषयं ज्ञानमुदपत्स्यत, तस्मादतीतानागतं स्वरूपतोऽस्तीति। किञ्च भोगभागीयस्य वापवर्गभागीयस्य वा कर्मणः फलमुत्पित्सु यदि निरुपाख्यमिति तदुद्देशेन तेन निमित्तेन कुशलानुष्ठानं न युज्यते। सतश्च फलस्य निमित्तं वर्तमानीकरणे समर्थं नापूर्वापजनने। सिद्धं निमित्तं नैमित्तिकस्य विशेषानुग्रहं कुरुते, नापूर्वमुत्पादयतीति।

 The ‘not-as-yet-manifest’is of the nature of the future. The ‘past’is of the nature of that which has been experienced. The present is that which has started its activity (is in active operation). This threefold substance is the object of knowledge (of the yogī). If this (threefold substance) had not existed in essence then, this knowledge, not having any object, would not arise. Therefore the past and the future exist in essence.

 Moreover, if the result (fruit) of deeds causing either experience or liberation, which is yet to emerge, were not describable, then the actions of the good (wise), keeping that (end) in view, or for that purpose, will not be proper. The cause is capable of making a result which is already existent, come into being and (it is) not (capable) of producing something (altogether) new. A cause which is present (fully established) helps specially in bringing about the effect; but it does not cause anything (altogether) new to come into existence.

 **धर्मी चानेकधर्मस्वभावः। तस्य चाध्वभेदेन धर्माः प्रत्यवस्थिताः। न च यथा वर्तमानं व्यक्तिविशेषापन्नं द्रव्यतोऽस्त्येवमतीतमनागतं च। कथं तर्हि? स्वेनैव व्यङ्ग्येन स्वरूपेणानागतमस्ति, स्वेन चानुभूतव्यक्तिकेन स्वरूपेणातीतमिति, वर्तमानस्यैवाध्वनः स्वरूपव्यक्तिरिति, न सा भवत्यतीतानागतयोरध्वनोः। एकस्य चाध्वनः समये द्वावध्वानौ धर्मिसमन्वागतौ भवत एवेति, नाभूत्वा भावस्त्रयाणामध्वनामिति॥१२॥**

 The characterised (substance) is of the nature of many characteristics (qualities). And due to its temporal distinction the characteristics have a distinct order of existence. Moreover, the past and the not-as-yet-manifest (future) do not exist as a substance like the present, which has attained a particularised special form. How then (are the past and future forms)? The future exists in its own form as a thing to be manifested; the past exists in its form as a thing already experienced.

 It is only the present, temporal state which has a particularised form of its own and that form does not belong to the past or future temporal forms. At the time of appearance of one temporal state the other two temporal states are only inherent in the substance; hence the three temporal states do not come into ‘being’after a state of ‘not-being’

 Objection—But then, it is said that in their absence there is absence of this[^850]. In that case it is detrimental to the established doctrine. How is that? The doctrine is that “nāstyasataḥsaṃbhavaḥ”= there is no coming into being (of that which does not exist) and “na cāsti sato vināśaḥ[^482]”.If latent-impressions exist, then “dravyatvena saṃbhavantyaḥkatham nivartiṣyate[^566]”, i.e. they do not cease to exist. So how can it be said therein that in their absence there is the absence of this. Alternatively how can there be kaivalya (liberation) when the latent-impressions created by cause, etc., have not ceased to exist. The answer is given (as) *atitānāgatam svarūpato'styadhvabhedāddharmāṇām*.

[^566]: "The translation is not given again."

[^850]: ॑# "In the absence of cause, fruit, support and object of support, there is absence of latent-impressions."

 Answer—Or it is like this. From the point of view of the doctrine the commentary does not mean that. How is that? The statement *eṣāmabhāve tadabhāvaḥ* does not mean that there is an absolute non-existence of cause, etc., and the latent-impressions. How can that be? “nāstyasataḥvāsanāḥ[^567]”(when they exist as substances).

[^567]: "It specifically states the absence so how can you say there is no absolute non-existence?"

 When there is confusion regarding the words used what it means is that the latent- impressions do not cease to exist totally. It only means that they continue to exist in the form of the past state.

 “bhaviṣyat vyaktikam”= that which has the nature of future existence is “bhaviṣyad- vyaktikam”This is like the form of the pot in the state of a lump of clay (before coming into existence). That is something which has not come into existence as yet. The means to bring into being something which ought to come into existence has begun.

 
“bhūtavyaktikamatītam[^851]”= that which has exceeded the nature of being obtained, i.e., available in the form of an object. This is like a broken pot which is known as something past. Something which is not indicated, something which is not about to come into existence, i.e., for whose manifestation one has to resort to some means. The ‘not past’ is that whose nature is not past[^568].Then what is it? “vyāpāropārūḍham mānam” This is like the pot with reference to its action[^569].

[^568]: "He is defining the present object—one which exists at present. Thus it is not something which has to be brought into being through some means. Nor is it something which is past."

[^569]: " Action of bringing water for instance."

[^851]: # "The available texts have “anubhūtavyaktikam” whereas the Vivaraṇa has “bhūta."

  All these three, having the qualities of past, future and present, exist in the substance that is present in the form of qualities and we consider that it is “jñeyam” (the object) of “jñānasya”(knowledge) that is authentic, which is without any error, whose nature is decisive in the entire world. How do you say that? Because it has the object which gives rise to definite knowledge.

 यदि चैतद्वस्तु स्वरूपतो नाभविष्यत् नेदं निर्विषयं ज्ञानमुदपत्स्यत। यथा शशविषाणादि निश्चितज्ञानोत्पत्तिकारणं न भवति। न च तथेह निश्चितवस्तुज्ञानोत्पत्तिहेतुविषयत्वं न विद्यते। सकलजनानुभवविषयमिदं ज्ञानं वर्तते। घटो भविष्यति घटो भूत इति च। तस्माद्वस्त्वेव कालत्रयसम्बन्धि। परिनिश्चितज्ञानोत्पत्तिविषयत्वात्॥  

 अथ वा नावस्तुविषयमतीते भविष्यति च घटादौ ज्ञानम्। शब्दविकल्पितत्वे सति निश्चितरूपेण उत्पद्यमानत्वात्, वर्तमानघटादिविषयज्ञानवत्। अव्यभिचाराच्च। लिङ्गानुमेयत्वाच्च, धूमेन अग्न्यादिज्ञानवत्। लिङ्गदर्शनानन्तरोत्पत्तेर्वा॥

 यद्वा, अतीतमनागतं च वस्तु सत् स्वरूपेण, लिङ्गदर्शनानन्तरबुद्धिविषयत्वात्, प्रसिद्धानुमेयवत्। तस्मादतीतानागतं स्वरूपतोऽस्ति॥

 “yadi patsyata”. For instance hare's horns and so on are not the cause for giving rise to definite knowledge. Similarly, as in that instance[^852]it is not as if there is no object which is the cause for knowledge of a definite substance here. This knowledge is something which is the experience of all human beings. So is the knowledge ‘The pot will come into existence’and ‘The pot existed’Therefore the substance alone is connected with all the three times, being able to give rise to definite knowledge.

[^852]: # "Instance of the hare's horns."

 Nor will knowledge arise pertaining to the past of future pot, etc., when it is without substance[^570]. When it is brought about by words it comes into being in a definite form[^571]just like knowledge pertaining to an existing pot and so on. There is no confusion in it and it can also be inferred by an indicatory mark just as the knowledge of fire, etc., is inferred through smoke. Or it comes into being after the perception of the mark[^572].

[^570]: "How does one describe a substanceless something as past? It has no identity or character and a mere nothing cannot cease to exist and cannot be understood like 'The pot has ceased to exist.'"

[^571]: "When the words 'the pot has ceased to exist' are uttered a knowledge comes into being unlike the sentence 'the hare's horms have ceased to exist'"

[^572]: "The previous knowledge of a pot which has reached a past state is its mark."

 Or the past and not-as-yet-manifest substance exists in essence since it is the object of knowledge subsequent to the knowledge of an indicatory mark, like the well known inference.“tasmād. . asti”

 Moreover for one who desires the (fruits of deeds like) “bhogabhāgīyasya” = sacrifice, etc., which are suitable for experience (of their fruit in future lives), “apavar vā” = and samādhi, etc., which lead to liberation (which are yet to emerge), are indescribable (non-existent) like the hare's horns for one who does not believe in them. It is not said that the hare's horns will come into existence. This case is not like that. Then what is it like? By doing sacrifices one will gain svarga, and by practising samādhi, etc., one will gain liberation, thus it has been taught by wise men through very mature arguments[^573].

[^573]: "Thus there is a difference between a hare's horns and the results of such deeds."

 Therefore being indescribable “taduddeśena”= keeping the result in view or be-

ing indescribable keeping the result as reason, “kuśalānujñānam[^853]”how can the wise preach or permit such advice as “Do this and by this deed, that will come into being” without themselves obtaining it? Moreover, if there is attainment of only what one sees there will be no difference between a wise man and a foolish one. Or the wise can have false knowledge and the foolish will be the ones with proper (correct) knowledge.

[^853]: # "The available reading is 'kuśalānuṣṭhānam' and not ‘kuśalānujñānam' as in the Vivaraṇa."

  Moreover, due to knowledge of the non-existent the wise will also not strive to work for the result[^574].And since there is no distinction between non-existences[^575] (absences) there will be no idea of the causal law; or from everything, everything can (cannot) come into being. Nor can one accept a cause; if accepted, then one desiring oil will take sand even, for what is the use of putting great effort through sesame seeds. And that which is absolutely non-existent will bring forth this absolutely new result[^576].But this is not seen (in the world).

[^574]: " As it does not exist by this argument."

[^575]: "Non-existence of a pot or cloth has no difference per se."

[^576]: "apūrva is something new; it can also mean dharma and adharma or the result such as svarga which comes after death."

 Therefore, deeds pertaining to either worldly experience or liberation (from rebirth) are capable to actualise a result whose cause is already present and “samartham nāpūrvopajane” (are not capable of producing something new). A present cause by its essence is the cause[^577]. A vessel, heat, curdling, etc., specially favour the effect like curds, etc., by manifestation of the increasing stages of solidifying, etc. It does not bring into being an altogether new curd; so also is the case here with deeds pertaining to worldly experience, etc.

[^577]: "An existent thing is the essence of cause."

  Moreover “dharmībhāvaḥ” = (the substance) is of the essence of many qualities. It is just like a block of gold which is of the essence of the properties of past, present and not-as-yet-manifest ear-rings, necklaces, etc. “tasya”= of that substance “adhvabhedena”= by the distinction of attributes like past, etc., “dharmāḥpratyavasthitāḥ” (the attributes are present).

 (A present) substance “vyaktiviśeṣāpannam”= which has attained manifestation as necklaces, etc., exists “dravyataḥ”= in the form of effects, having attained activity

(utility) and not something which is “naivamatītamanāgatam ca”(past or in the future state). “kim tarhi[^854]”? svenaiva . .atītamasti[^578]”.Through its nature of something which is to come into being (the future exists) and through having gone beyond the stage of obtainment (the past exists).

[^578]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has “atītamasti’and not 'atītamiti'"

[^854]: # "The available reading is 'katham tarhi' while the Vivaraṇa has 'kim tarhi'"

  “vartamānasya.. eveti[^579]”.At the time (of the existence of one temporal state) (the other two states are inherent in the substance) and due to opposition (do not come into existence). The avoidance of mixture of temporal states has thus been given.

[^579]: "The Vivaraṇakāra adds ‘tu' in ‘tvadhvanaḥAgain instead of 'svarūpavyaktiriti' he has 'svarūpato vyaktiriti'"

 नापि नियम उपपद्यते। घटेनैव व्यपदिश्यते, घटोऽतीतो घटये भविष्यतीति च। न पुनः कुलालादिभिरपदिश्यते कुलालादयोऽतीता भविष्यन्ति वेति॥

 In the case of that which has no attributes of past and future states in its very nature, its characteristics do not attain different temporal states. Why is this so? In that case there is no state like ‘The pot will come into existence’or ‘It has ceased to exist’The pot is neither the potsherds nor a lump of clay. Thus it is only at the time of the temporal state of present existence that there is the coming together of the attributes of all the three temporal states. Therefore it is only an existent pot which is mentioned as something which has ceased to be and which has not-as-yet-come into being. Both the lump of clay and the potsherds not being pots and since there is no pot in the clay (as yet) it can be said with reference to the lump of clay and potsherds that the pot will come into existence and the pot has ceased to be, respectively. Then one can desire to say that even a cow can become a horse or a horse can become a cow.

 Question—But it can be said that the prior-negation and posterior-negation of the pot are known as not-as-yet-manifest and past (respectively).

 That approach is even more dangerous. In that case though, it may be proper to say that the cow can become a horse as both of them are substances (entities); in this case it is not proper on the part of those who advocate existence (substance) to speak of absence as ‘the pot has ceased to be’and ‘the pot has not-as-yet-come into being’ through words which denote a substance.

  Nor is the rule correct. Through the (present) pot itself it is mentioned that the pot has ceased to be and the pot will come into existence[^580]. For instance, through the

[^580]: "There is a transcendence of the states here-the present pot is present but it is mentioned as something not there as yet or as ceasing to be, which on the face of it is absurd to say the least says the opponent."

(existing) potters one does not mention that the potters have ceased to be or they will come into being. It can be said that this is so because it is (the future and the past) pot itself which is not obtained in that context.

  In that case since (future and past) elephants and lions also are not obtained (then) there will be the danger of mentioning them (also). It can be said that there is mention of only that which has previously been obtained. But then there will even be a problem in the action connected with pots[^581].

[^581]: "Since the pot does not exist now and without an existing pot one cannot speak of any action concerning it."

  Question—But if by that there is the absence of action, etc., connected with the pot—the answer is that it is not so, as absence has no special relationship. Neither a relationship characterised by inherence nor by contact can exist between something that exists and something that does not exist. Thus this absence is of the pot and cannot apply to the action and so on. And if there is either of the relationships then there is the danger of absence having substance. But if is said that it is a substance then it is established that a substance has the temporal states of present, future and past.

 It can be said in a manner of speaking that the state of potsherds are the parts and by its relationship points to the fact that the pot will come into being and the pot has ceased to exist and this is like saying that food is life (vital breath); here also just as there is no pot in the thread, stick, wheel and potter so also in the lump of clay and the potsherds its absence is not different and there is mention of the past state of the pot with reference to the potsherds and not with reference to the potter, etc., thus the rule is not right. Moreover it is not proper that the existing means of bringing into existence pots, etc., has a relationship with such pots, etc., to be created which are not existing at present. And when there is no such relationship there is no activity of the agent with a view to make pots. If it is said that a relationship of inherence which is inseparable between the causes and their effects is not rejected then the answer is, it is not so. Separable or inseparable relationship is seen between substances that are

existing at the same time. Neither a separable nor inseparable relationship is ever seen between something that exists and that which is non-existent.

 तस्माज्जन्यजनकानामपि सम्बन्धाभ्युपगमाद्विद्यमानत्वमेवेति, उत्पत्तेः प्रागूर्ध्वं च विद्यते कार्यम्, वस्त्वन्तरसम्बन्धात्, प्रसिद्धघटादिवत्। उपलप्स्यमानत्वादुपलब्धत्वाच्च, अपवरकस्थघटादिवत्। उद्दिश्य कर्त्रा प्राप्यत्वात्, देशान्तरवत्। तथा कर्तृव्यापारप्राप्यत्वाच्चेति॥

 तस्माद्व्यक्तिरूपेण वासनानामत्यन्तविनिवृत्तिः। गुणरूपेण तु सतीनामपि कार्यासमर्थत्वान्न कैवल्याभावदोषः। नापि सिद्धान्तविरोधः॥१२॥

 Therefore, since there is acceptance of relationship between that which creates and that which is created it (the relationship) has existence; before creation and afterwards the effect exists, as it is related closely within the substance as in the case of the known pot. This is so as it will be perceived (obtained) and as it has been obtained like a pot lying inside a hole (inner room). It can be obtained by the agent if there is the intention to do so; this is like reaching another place (if the intention is there). Similarly it can be got by the action of the agent.

 Moreover, by the words 'past' and not-as-yet-manifest, people in the world do not understand or indicate a meaning which is not there (present) as in the case of the sky-lotus. Therefore the past and future states exist in essence.

 “nābhūtvā . nām”. How is that? There is manifestation of only those that exist (and not of something that does not).

 Therefore there is absolute cessation of the latent-impressions in their manifested form[^855];whereas, though existing in the form of guṇas by not being able to produce effects, there is no danger of the absence of kaivalya[^582].

[^582]: "As the potency to give rise to repeated births is no more there, kaivalya comes into being, though they are therein the form of the guṇas."

[^855]: # "This is in keeping with the 'satkāryavāda' of the school."

**ते व्यक्तसूक्ष्मा गुणात्मानः॥१३॥**

 They (the three) are manifested and subtle and are of the nature of the (three) guṇas.

** ते खल्वमी त्र्यध्वानो धर्मा वर्तमाना व्यक्तात्मानोऽतीतानागताः सूक्ष्मात्मानः षडविशेषरूपाः। सर्वमिदं गुणानां सन्निवेशविशेषमात्रमिति परमार्थतो गुणात्मानः। तथा च शास्त्रानुशासनम्—**

** गुणानां परमं रूपं न दृष्टिपथमृच्छति।**

** यत्तु दृष्टिपथं प्राप्तं तन्मायेव सुतुच्छकम्॥ इति॥ १३॥**

 These characteristics of the nature of the three temporal states are as follows-the present are of the nature of the manifested, the past and the future, which are in the form of the six unparticularised, are of the nature of the subtle.

 Since this whole world is nothing more than an arrangement of the guṇas there-

fore, in essence, they are of the nature of the guṇas. Thus there is this teaching in the śāstra—'The true form of the guṇas does not come within the range of sight; that which has reached the range of sight is like illusion, without any substance.'

   In what form then do the characteristics of the nature of past, not-as-yet-manifest and present exist? In order to indicate that he says *te vyaktasūkṣmā guṇātmānaḥ.*

* *“te khalvamī rūpāḥ”= there are the three temporal states of the past, the not-as-yet-manifest and the present; (the present) is that which has the quality of present existence, “vyaktātmānaḥ”= having the nature of being objects of the thoughts of human beings. 'atītā . . . naḥ” = (they) have not attained the state of being objects of the thoughts of human beings and “ṣaḍaviśeṣasvarūpāḥ[^856]”= are of the nature of asmitā and so on.**²**From them come the sixteen mutations having the relationship of cause and effect[^583].

[^583]: "From the sixteen proceeds the next stage of creation and thus they are considered the causes of those effects."

[^856]: # "This is not found in available readings."

 “sarvamidam”= this manifestation of the form of cause and effect pertaining to the self, this subtle unparticularised form like asmitā, etc., and this indicatory mark alone (prakṛti) not distinct from the subtle, all this seen as the world is only the nature of the guṇas-sattva, rajas and tamas having the attributes of brightness, activity and inertia.

 “tathā .. ”= each of them has the true nature of non-destruction and creation. That is not an object which is seen. (That which is seen) through the guṇas being crushed[^584], is of the nature of an arrangement; made by a state of disturbance “tanmāyeva”= (it is like an illusion) but not just an illusion, being without any essence it is like an illusion. “sutucchakam”= very little (useless) as it is a partial transformation of the guṇas in a state of equilibrium.

[^584]: "Guṇas being active and manifesting the universe when their equilibrium is disturbed."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**²**The unparticularised forms (aviśeṣas) are asmitā and the five tanmātras and ahaṃkāra (asmitā). They are so-called as in the evolutionary table of Sāṅkhya-Yoga they give rise to further evolutes. The viśeṣas, on the other hand, cannot be diversified further and are the five mahābhūtas, ten senses and the mind. For more details, cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. II, pp. 106 ff.

** यदा तु सर्वेगुणाः, कथमेकः शब्द एकमिन्द्रियमिति?**

 But if all things are guṇas then how is it that there is a single sound(and) a single sense organ?

**परिणामैकत्वाद्वस्तुतत्त्वम्॥१४॥**

 Due to an unity (singleness) of mutation, there is the reality of a thing.

** प्रख्याक्रियास्थितिशीलानां गुणानां ग्रहणात्मकानां करणभावेनैकः परिणामः श्रोत्रमिन्द्रियम्। ग्राह्यात्मकानां शब्दतन्मात्रभावेनैकः परिणामः शब्दो विषय इति। शब्दादीनां मूर्तिसमानजातीयानामेकः परिणामः पृथिवीपरमाणुस्तन्मात्रावयवः। तेषां चैकः परिणामः पृथिवी गौर्वृक्षः पर्वत इत्येवमादि। भूतान्तरेष्वपि स्नेहौष्ण्यप्रणामित्वावकाशदानान्युपादाय सामान्यमेकविकारारम्भः समाधेयः।**

 When the guṇas (constituents) of the nature of illumination, activity and inertia, have as their essence the process of knowing in the form of instruments (of perception) there is a single mutation such as the sense-organ of hearing; when their essence is the object of knowledge in the form of the subtle element of sound there is a single mutation such as sound, the object of the sense-organ. An atom of earth which has the subtle elements as parts is a single mutation of sound and others (perceptible objects) which belong to the general class of limitation-in-extent (having a form).

  And a single mutation of these (atoms) are the earth, a cow, a tree, a mountain and so on. In the case of other elements as well, by taking up the generic qualities of liquidity, heat, impulsion (motivity, mobility) and space (making of space) one has to understand, by meditation, that there is the beginning of a single mutation having similar property.

** नास्त्यर्थो विज्ञानविसहचरः अस्ति तु ज्ञानमर्थविसहचरं स्वप्नादौ कल्पितमित्यनया दिशा ये वस्तुस्वरूपमपह्नुवते, ज्ञानपरिकल्पनामात्रं वस्तु स्वप्नविषयोपमं न परमार्थतोऽस्तीति य आहुस्ते तथेति प्रत्युपस्थितमिदं स्वमाहात्म्येन वस्तु कथमप्रमाणात्मकेन विकल्पज्ञानबलेन वस्तुस्वरूपमुत्सृज्य तदेवापलपन्तः श्रद्धेयवचनाः स्युः॥१४॥**

 They who deny the reality of objects by the reasoning that (1) there is no object unaccompanied by thought; however (2) there are thoughts unaccompanied by (the presence of) objects as are fancied in dreams &c.; they who say that (3) objects do not exist in reality but are just constructions of the mind and can be compared to objects in a dream; how can these (people) who reject (deny) the reality of the object which exists as it is by its own authority (do so) on the strength of fancied cognition without force of proof; while prattling about the very thing (they deny) how can they inspire confidence (in their own words)?

 “yadā. . indriyam[^857]”,i.e., when all the guṇas are earth, etc., then how is there a single sound created from the conch, etc., or a single sense-organ like the ear, etc., which is the support of one idea. It should not be so. Due to a threefold cause, there has to be a thought of a three-some. Similarly, in the case of the sense-organs also each is threefold. But it does not fit the rule. One sound alone is not to be grasped; nor is the ear alone to be the grasper—that does not fit the rule[^585]. It is similarly to be applied in the case of touch and so on and in the case of the organ of touch, etc[^586].This rule is seen (in the world).

[^585]: "In usage it is not so. The rule is broken."

[^586]: "The rule is equally applicable to all the objects and all the sense-organs. This seems to be a naive statement of stating what is obvious."

[^857]: # "The introduction to IV.14."

 The reason for that is to be mentioned. So he says *pariṇāmaikatvādvastutattvam*. Due to the predominance of sattva[^587] (there is one mutation in the form of an instrument such as the sense-organ of hearing[^588]), of the arrangement of asmitā (ahaṃkāra) of the essence of knowledge. Just as the opposing things like oil, wick and light in the case of a lamp (so is this). Similarly in the case of the sense-organ of touch, etc., one should understand that the mutation as a single organ is due to the operation of factors which have to be done according to rules for achieving their respective goals.

[^587]: " Available readings have “prakhyākriyā...”instead of “prakhyāpravṛtti ”in the Vivaraṇa."

[^588]: "Instead of “śrotramindriyam”the Vivaraṇa has “śrotrendriyam”"

   Similarly, guṇas (of the essence of objects) having a predominance of tamas have one mutation in the form of “śabdabhāvena[^589]” (sound). Similarly, “śabdādīnām paramāṇuḥ[^590]”.“teṣāmekaḥ. . . ādiḥ[^591]”= of those minutest atoms (there is a single mutation like earth, cow, etc.):

[^589]: "The Vivaraṇa has “śabdabhāvena” instead of “śabdatanmātrabhāvena”in available texts."

[^590]: "There is nothing new added by the Vivaraṇakāra here."

[^591]: "Instead of “teṣām caikaḥ”the Vivaraṇakāra has “teṣām ekah”."

 This has to be understood (with reference to other elements as well). (An atom of water having the subtle element of taste as parts is a single mutation) of sound, touch, colour and taste which belong to the general class of liquidity. (A single mutation of those atoms is water[^592].)

[^592]: "Thus while an atom of earth is produced from the subtle element possessing all the five qualities, that of water has four, that of light three, that of touch two and that of sound alone has one quality."

  An atom of light having the subtle element of colour as parts, is a single mutation of sound, touch and colour which belong to the general class of heat. A single mutation of those atoms is fire, the submarine-fire and the flame in the piece of wood.

 Similarly, an atom of air having the subtle element of touch as parts is a single mutation of sound and touch which belong to the general class of impulsion (mobility). A single mutation of those atoms is wind (air) and the seven groups of maruts.

 Similarly, ether (space) is a single mutation of those subtle elements of sound which belong to the general class of not-being-enclosed. Thus in the said manner one has to connect “snehauṣṇya. . samādheyaḥ”(a single mutation). Therefore, since there is a single mutation of many it has a single object[^593].And the rule of that which is known and the process of knowing is all in order[^594].

[^593]: "It is spoken of as being a single object."

[^594]: "The rule of the object being one and the sense-organ of knowledge being one."

 ननु च नास्त्येवासौ एकप्रत्ययविषयः शब्दादिः। एतत्तु सर्वं विज्ञानपरिजृम्भितमेव, विज्ञानभावभावित्वात्। कथं तद्भावभावित्वमित्याह—नास्त्यर्थो विज्ञानविसहचरःपृथग्विज्ञानादुपलब्धः पृथग्भावी वा। विज्ञानमर्थविसहचरं पृथक्त्वेनोपलब्धं पृथग्भावि वा अस्ति। तस्मादर्थो विज्ञानव्यतिरेकेण नास्तीति प्रतिजानीमहे॥

 Objection—But then, sound, etc., are not the object of a single knowledge. All this is the manifestation of knowledge (vijñāna) itself[^595]as it is produced by the existence knowledge[^596]. How does it (the object) exist when it (knowledge) is existent? He says (in answer) ‘nāstyartho’= (the object) is not found unaccompanied by knowledge (of it) nor is it different from it. “vijñānam . ”i.e. (knowledge) is found unaccompanied (by the object) or as different (from it[^597]). Therefore we assert that an object does not exist different from (its) thought.

[^595]: "The view of the Vijñānavāda school of Buddhists."

[^596]: "The objects of knowledge are just constructions of the mind."

[^597]: "This is seen in dreams, hallucinations, etc."

 There is also authority (proof) for this. An object known does not exist different from the thought (of it) since it cannot be grasped as different from its knowledge, as it is of the essence of knowledge. Thoughts during waking are devoid of outside reality because they are thoughts just like thoughts during dreaming. Or alternatively (one can say that) the objects during waking are constructions of thoughts as they are objects like objects during dreaming. Or alternatively (one can say that) knowledge is not different from the object as it is knowledge, like knowledge during dreaming.

 यद्येवं स्यात् किं नश्छिन्नं स्यात्? पुरुषस्य दृश्यवियोगात् कैवल्यं प्रस्तुतं न सिद्धं स्यात्॥

 यथा उपलभ्यमानस्य स्तम्भादेरभावः एवमुपलभ्यमानत्वाद्विज्ञानस्याप्यभावः। तदभावे च लिङ्गाभावादुपलब्धुरप्यभावः प्राप्नुयादिति, कस्य कैवल्यम्? केन दृश्येन वियोगःस्यात्? केन सम्प्रयोगे वा बन्धःप्रतिज्ञायेत? बन्धाभावे चाभ्युदयनिः श्रेयसार्थप्रवृत्तिफलता न प्रसज्येत॥

  If it is so, what do we lose? Will we be destroyed? As puruṣa is separate from the known (seen) object the liberation (kaivalya) mentioned will not happen. Just as there is the absence of objects to be perceived like pillar, etc., similarly even knowledge, as it is something known, is non-existent. And in its absence there can be the absence of one who knows because of the absence of the indicatory mark[^598];then to whom does kaivalya belong? Separation from the known (seen) object takes place through whom? Or when there is connection by whom will bondage be asserted? And in the absence of bondage, fruition of activity for the sake of prosperity and liberation will not be applicable.

[^598]: "Knowledge being the mark of a human being."

  Moreover there is something more—those who say that there is no object other than the thought (knowledge) of it also say that knowledge is an object and it is perceived as a single object (substance) just as in the perception of ‘agni is fire’ (which is a tautology). When that is so, knowledge is both the known and the knower; the object is both the grasped and one that grasps; thus there is confusion only in name. Again one cannot deny the state of being known and being the knower of one thing. In that case purusa also attains the state of being (both) the known and the knower. Even then there will be the impossibility of liberation—thus there will be these many defects[^599].

[^599]: "In accepting the Vijñānavādin's arguments the entire philosophical edifice will crumble down."

 तस्मात् अमुया दिशा अनेन न्यायाभासबलेन ये वस्तुस्वरूपमपह्नुवते ज्ञानपरिकल्पनामात्रं वस्तु स्वप्नविषयोपमम्, न तु परमार्थतोऽस्तीति, ते स्वयं तथेति अभ्युपगम्य स्वमाहात्म्येन प्रत्युपस्थितं वस्तु कथमप्रमाणात्मकेन विकल्पज्ञानबलेन वस्तु स्वयमुपगृह्य अभ्युपगम्य तदेव अभ्युपगतं अपलपन्तः इदमित्यभ्युपेत्य इदं नास्तीत्यपहुवानाः श्रद्धेयवचनाः स्युः। न हि स्वानुभवप्रत्याख्यायिनः श्रद्धानीयवचनविस्तारा भवितुमर्हन्ति॥

 Therefore “amuyā .. syuḥ[^600]”= by this false logic (how can) they themselves accept

[^600]: "Available texts have “anayā”instead of “amuyā”in the Vivaraṇa."

them on fancied cognition, i.e., grasping it as such and then denying it**¹**. Those who deny their own experience cannot be capable of inducing faith in their own words.

  Therein, the conclusion that there is no object different from knowledge (of it) is something which is opposed to direct perception. We know of knowledge as apprehension. We know of objects having broad, wide shapes. Knowledge as the knower is the illuminator and the object is the one illuminated. Since the object and knowledge are known by their different characteristics there is no trace of non-difference between them[^601].Therefore, since they are grasped as different, your reason (for their non-difference) is not established[^602].

[^601]: "In other words they are different because of their different nature."

[^602]: "Unless you can prove that they are not grasped as different, your conclusion cannot be right."

  Moreover, broad, wide shapes do not belong to knowledge itself. One knowledge cannot be (both) the illuminator and the illuminated like in the case of a single lamp. In the case of two different lamps there is no relationship obtaining as that of (one) being the illuminator and the (other) illumined; and in the case of one, within itself, it is not possible to be obtained; so is the case with knowledge.

 अपि चानैकान्तिकञ्च बुद्धेन प्रतिपक्षवादिना च। न चासौ नास्तीति शक्यं प्रतिज्ञातुं, यं प्रति सिसाधयिषसि, स चेत्तद्विज्ञानव्यतिरिक्तः, तथा घटादिरपि सिध्यति॥

 स्वप्नज्ञानमपि उपलब्धार्थविषयत्वात् न निरालंबनम्। प्रतिज्ञायाः प्रत्यक्षविरोधो लोकविरोधश्च। सर्वं ज्ञानं सालम्बनं, ज्ञानत्वात्, प्रतिवादिदुष्टवाक्यज्ञानवत्, स्ववाक्यगुणज्ञानवच्च। ततश्च ज्ञानत्वादीनां निरालंबनत्वहेतूनामेवमादिभिरनैकान्तिकता॥१४॥

 Moreover the Buddhist opponent is not (arguing) to the point (their argument is inconclusive). It is not possible to assert that a person with whom one is arguing in order to convince him, does not exist; if he is different from knowledge (his cognition) then in the same way, he has to admit the existence of outside objects like pots, etc., (outside cognition). Since knowledge in dreams deal with objects already experienced they are not without supports. The conclusion (of the opponent) which is in contradiction to perception is against the (common) experience in the world. All knowledge has a support as it is knowledge similar to the knowledge conveyed by the wrong arguments of the opponent and like the knowledge conveyed by one's own sound argument. Therefore, there is inconclusiveness in such arguments based on reasons of not having supporting objects for (having) knowledge.

** कुतश्चैतदन्याय्यम्?—**

 And why is this incorrect?

**वस्तुसाम्ये चित्तभेदात्तयोर्विभक्तः पन्थाः॥१५॥**

 While there is present a common object, due to the different mind-stuffs, their ways of being are different.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1.**Nothing much is added to what the bhāṣya has said. The reading available is “vastusvarūpamutsṛjya” whereas the Vivaraṇa has "vastusvayamupgṛhya"

 **बहुचित्तालम्बनीभूतमेकं वस्तु साधारणम्। तत्खलु नैकचित्तपरिकल्पितं नाप्यनेकचित्तपरिकल्पितम् किं तु स्वप्रतिष्ठम्। कथम्? वस्तुसाम्ये चित्तभेदात्। धर्मापेक्षं चित्तस्य वस्तुसाम्येऽपि सुखज्ञानं भवत्यधर्मापेक्षं तत एव दुःखज्ञानमविद्यापेक्षं तत एव मूढज्ञानं सम्यग्दर्शनापेक्षं तत एव माध्यस्थ्यज्ञानमिति ।कस्य तच्चित्तेन परिकल्पितम्?**

 A single object is the common basis of many minds. That is neither the construction of a single mind nor the construction of many minds; but it is grounded in itself. Why is this so? Because, in the presence of a common object, the mind-stuffs are different.

 Even when the (external) object is the same, the feeling of pleasure of the mind depends on virtue (dharma), (and) there is the feeling of pain from the same object when there is dependence on vice (adharma); (and) there is a feeling of delusion from the same object when there is dependence on lack of right knowledge; (and) when there is dependence on discriminate-discernment there is a feeling of detachment from the same object. (Thus then) by whose mind has that object been constructed?

 **न चान्यचित्तपरिकल्पितेनार्थेनान्यस्य चित्तोपरागो युक्तः। तस्माद्वस्तुज्ञानयोर्ग्राह्यग्रहणभेदभिन्नयोर्विभक्तः पन्थाः। नानयोः संकरगन्धोऽप्यस्तीति।**

 **सांख्यपक्षे पुनर्वस्तु त्रिगुणं चलं च गुणवृत्तमिति धर्मादिनिमित्तापेक्षं चित्तैरभिसंबध्यते, निमित्तानुरूपस्य च प्रत्ययस्योत्पद्यमानस्य तेन तेनात्मना हेतुर्भवति। केचिदाहुः—ज्ञानसहभूरेवार्थो भोग्यत्वात् सुखादिवदिति। त एतया द्वारा साधारणत्वं बाधमानाः पूर्वोत्तरक्षणेषु वस्तुरूपमेवापह्नुवते॥ १५॥**

 Moreover, it is not proper for one person's mind-stuff to be affected by an object constructed (fancied) by another mind. Therefore the object and its thought (knowledge) which are different from each other, divided (as they are) as an object and an instrument of knowledge, exist on different levels-of-being. There is not the least bit of confusion between the two (as to their identity).

 In the Sāṅkhya school of thought again, the object is composed of the guṇas; and the functioning of the guṇas is always changing (unstable); and it (the object) comes into contact with different minds depending on such efficient causes as virtue (dharma) &c. And it becomes the cause of knowledge (ideas, notions) as they arise, each as such corresponding to the efficient (exciting) causes. Some say—the object is coexistent with knowledge as it is experienced like pleasure and so on. By this argument they deny the commonality (of the object) and question the very existence of the object in the prior and subsequent moments.

 कुतश्चैतदन्याय्यं गृह्यमाणं वस्तु नास्तीति? वस्तुसाम्ये चित्तभेदात्तयोर्विविक्तः पन्थाः। बहुचित्तालम्बनीभूतं अनेकचित्तविषयीभूतं एकं वस्तु पुत्रादिकं साधारणं समानम्। तत् खलु नैकचित्ततन्त्रं भवति। एकचित्ततन्त्रत्वाभावादनेकचित्तपरिकल्पितमपि न भवति॥

  “*kutaścaitadanyāyyam*”= (why is this idea) that the object known does not exist, (incorrect)? *vastusāmye cittabhedāttayorviviktaḥpanthāḥ[^603].*

[^603]: "The sūtra reads vastu..tayorvibhaktaḥ panthāḥ in available texts instead of tayorviviktaḥ panthāḥ in the Vivaraṇa."

 “babucittālambanībhūtam. . ”(a single object) is the common object of many minds like a son, etc., (it is not) dependent on one mind. Just because it is not dependent on one mind it does not mean that (it is the construction of many minds).

 “kintu svarūpapratiṣṭham[^604]”= it exists independently without dependence on the mind. “katham” Even when the object like son, etc., is one, there are many perceptions (mind-stuffs) of those possessing the object with reference to the single object like son, etc.

[^604]: "The reading available is “svapratiṣṭham”whereas the Vivaraṇa has “svarūpapratiṣṭham”"

 Question—How is there this different mind-stuff? (In answer) he says “dharmā-pekṣam.. ”, i.e., just as from a son there is a (feeling of joy) for the parents (and) from the same object like son, etc. (a feeling of pain) is generated in those who are not good (friendly), (when there is dependence on adharma).

 From the same object there is a feeling of delusion in those who are lustful (when there is dependence on lack of right knowledge). From the same object like a son, etc., there arises (the feeling of indifference) in yogīs (when there is dependence on right knowledge, insight) which is devoid of a feeling of acquisition or abandonment. Due to dependence on greed there is a feeling of wanting to eat (one's son) in the case of people like the Kaulas[^605],etc., (following the Vāmācāra). For the same reason for one who is detached from objects like son, etc., there is a feeling of something dead.

[^605]: "This reference to the Kaulas is significant in the context of the authorship problem. Cf. Introduction to the present work, vol. I, p. xix."

 If something imagined by one (any) mind can come to be then, through something constructed by one mind, the minds of others will be affected. This is not logical as one does not see connection between things which are totally unconnected with each other. Moreover if through something thought by one mind another mind can be affected, then everyone will know everything. One does not see this happening.

 “tasmāt”= therefore (one concludes that) there is no object constructed by the mind. “vastujñānayoḥ. . sti”. Objects like a son, etc., on which knowledge (feelings) like pleasure depend are not constructed by that knowledge, as it affects many minds opposed to it[^858],resembling the merits and demerits in an assertion, a counter-assertion and a conclusion. Even in such matters as an assertion and a counter-assertion, etc., if one accepts only the existence of knowledge, there will be the futility of such activity as reaching a conclusion such as an inference through some means of inference[^606].

[^606]: "This activity cannot have any fruitful purpose."

[^858]: # "The same feeling is not felt by other minds. Therefore it cannot be the construction of the knowledge of one mind."

 Objection—But then, there is difference in forms of knowledge due to the respective knowledge being different.

 Answer—Let it be. That same object, being the object of another knowledge, is established as a different object[^607].There is only confusion as far as the names are concerned. It is not possible to separate the object from one possessing it (i.e., the subject or knowledge of it). Therefore, there is not the least bit of difference between these two[^608].

[^607]: "The object as different from knowledge is still not established."

[^608]: "There is confusion as to their identity. It is established that they are still the same."

 Objection—But then, even when the object abides in itself it is not logical that it should give rise to different feelings like pleasure, etc[^609].

[^609]: "There seems to be some inconsistency in thinking so, according to the opponent."

 Answer—He says (in answer) “vastu sambadhyate”(due to such efficient causes like dharma, etc.) there are the changes into the different forms of pleasure, pain, etc., as it has these various powers[^610].

[^610]: "Every object is composed of the three constituents of prakṛti from the Sāṅkhya-Yoga point of view"

 धर्मादिनिमित्तानुरूपस्य चोत्पद्यमानस्य प्रत्ययस्य तेन तेन निमित्तेन आत्मना हेतुर्भवति। सत्वात्मना धर्मादिनिमित्तापेक्षं पुत्रादिवस्तु सुखहेतुर्भवति। रजआत्मना त्वधर्मनिमित्तापेक्षं दुःखहेतुर्भवति। तमआत्मना त्वविद्यापेक्षं तदेव वस्तु मोहहेतुर्भवति। सत्तामात्रात्मना सम्यग्दर्शनापेक्षं तदेव माध्यस्थ्यज्ञानहेतुर्भवति॥

 “dharmādi. bhavati” = An object like a son, etc., becomes the cause for pleasure by its sattva-essence depending on dharma; it becomes the cause for pain by its

rajas essence, depending on adharma; and that same object becomes the cause for delusion by its tamas essence, depending on avidyā; and that same object becomes the cause for knowledge (feeling) of tranquillity (indifference) by its essence of just existence, depending on correct insight.

“kecidahuḥ[^859]”.Some of the Buddhists believing in the existence of outside objects, say “jñānasahabhūrevārthaḥ”= just as knowledge arises and also perishes every moment without any permanent support, similarly, along with knowledge the object is known and it also perishes—“bhogyatvāt sukhādivat” Thus anything that is experienced is of the nature of pleasure, pain, etc., and has the special quality of rising and perishing along with knowledge; similarly objects like pots and so on, come into being and perish at the same time as the knowledge of it, as they are experienced[^611].

[^611]: "This is the Vaibhāṣika school of Buddhism."

[^859]: # "Some commentators like Vācaspati Miśra consider this portion as part of the bhāṣya while others like Vijñānabhikṣu consider it to be the introduction to IV.16. Here it is part of the bhāṣya."

 They also, like the school of Vijñānavādins, “sādhāraṇatvam. hnuvate”= (by denying the commonality of) pleasure, etc., of the object of support for many minds say that the object does not exist in the moments prior to and posterior to the coming into being of the knowledge of itself; (thus they deny the very being of the object).

  तस्मात् न हि वस्तुनः स्वरूपं विज्ञानसहभावि, तदेवेदमिति प्रत्यभिज्ञानात्। नाचिरजन्मप्रलयं तदेवेदमिति प्रत्यभिज्ञायेत, यथा विज्ञानम्। न हि तदेवादो मे विज्ञानमिति भवति। वस्तु पुनस्तदेवेदमिति प्रत्यभिज्ञायते। अर्थज्ञानयोरेकसमयभवित्वेऽप्येक(परिशेषः)विशेषःस्यात्॥

 नापि सादृश्यात् प्रत्यभिज्ञानम्। ग्राह्यग्राहकयोर्युगपदुत्पत्तिविनाशवत्वात्। व्यवस्थिते हि वस्त्वन्तरदृश्ये अन्यतत्सदृशवस्तुदर्शनेन सादृश्यप्रत्ययः। एवं तत्सदृशं वा द्रक्ष्यामीत्युत्तराभिलाषः। न हि तदहर्निश्चितमरणस्यापरेद्युरर्थदर्शनाकांक्षा जायते। नापि मत्सदृश ईक्षिष्यत इत्यभिलषति। न चैवं दृष्टम्। सर्वो हि स्वार्थमीहते। भिन्नसन्ततिष्वदर्शनात्॥

  Therefore, the nature of an object is not co-existent with that of its knowledge as there should be recognition of the form as 'this is itself that' That whose birth and death is of short duration (brief, momentary) is not recognised as 'this is itself that' like knowledge for instance[^612].One does not have the experience 'this knowledge of mine is that itself' Whereas an object is recognised as 'this is that itself' Even though the object and its knowledge occur at the same time there is difference.

[^612]: "There is no feeling of recognition in knowledge."

 Nor is the recognition due to similarity, as the knower and the known arise and perish at the same time[^613]. Only when an object exists and then when one sees another object by noticing that other object to be similar to the previous one there is knowledge of similarity. Or in this manner, there is a later hope of seeing an object similar to it. For instance a man whose death is certain in the course of the day cannot have the desire to see an object the next day. Nor will he hope that somebody like him will see it. Nor is something like this seen (in the world). Everyone desires one's own interest; one does not see (interest) in a similar series.

[^613]: "This is not possible with the knowledge of a past object."

 तस्मादिदानींतनोऽर्थः नेदानीन्तनज्ञानसहभूरेवेति, ग्राह्यत्वात्, अतीतार्थवत्। अतीतो वा नातीतज्ञानसहनाशजन्मा, ग्राह्यत्वात्, इदानीन्तनार्थवत्। भूतभविष्यज्ज्ञानग्राह्या अर्था अधुनाऽपि सन्ति, ग्राह्यत्वात्, अधुनातनप्रत्ययग्राह्यवत्। इदानीन्तनमपि वस्तु पूर्वोत्तरक्षणेषु तथैव॥

  अथ सुखदुःखज्ञानादिभिरनैकान्तिकमिति चेत्—न—अतीतानागतं स्वरूपतोऽस्तीति साधितत्वात्। एवं च सति सुखादीनां च स्वरूपेण सद्भावात् सुखादिवदिति साध्यसमानो दृष्टान्तः॥

   अथ वर्तमानरूपविशेषेणातीतानागतलक्षणयोरर्थस्य सुखादिवदभाव इति चेत्, सिद्धसाध्यता। न हि कुमारभाव एव वृद्धत्वं विद्यते॥१५॥

  Therefore the present object is not just co-existent with the present knowledge (of it), as it is known, similar to something that is past. Nor does the past have its origin and death co-existent with past knowledge as it is known as such similar to the present object[^860].Objects grasped through past and future knowledge exist now (in the present) as well, as they are perceived as such similar to the perception of the knowledge of the present existence. An existing object is also existing in the same way in the moments prior and posterior (to the knowledge of it).

[^860]: # "Cf. YS, IV.12."

 Objection—Then pleasure, pain, knowledge, etc., have a variable nature (are fallacious).

   Answer—That is not so; as it has already been proved that the past and the future do exist in essence. In this way pleasure, etc., exist in their essence, because they exist like pleasure, etc.,—will be an example which is the same as that to be proved[^614].

[^614]: "Thus it is a hetvābhāsa. The Vivaraṇakāra argues very much like a Naiyāyika here."

  Objection—But then, the object along with the speciality in the form of present existence having the characteristics of past and future states has absence like pleasure and so on.

 Answer—This is like proving what is already established. Old age is not the state of youth itself[^615].

[^615]: "But it does not need any proof as it is already established."

**न चैकचित्ततन्त्रं वस्तु तदप्रमाणकं तदा किं स्यात्॥१६॥**

 An object is not dependent on one mind; (for) when it is not cognised by it (that mind) then what would happen to it?

 **एकचित्ततन्त्रं चेद्वस्तु स्यात्तदा चित्ते व्यग्रे निरुद्धे वाऽस्वरूपमेव तेनापरामृष्टमन्यस्याविषयीभूतमप्रमाणकमगृहीतमस्वभावकं केनचित्तदानीं किं तत्स्यात्? संबध्यमानं च पुनश्चित्तेन कुत उत्पद्येत? ये चास्यानुपस्थिता भागास्ते चास्य न स्युरेवं नास्ति पृष्ठमित्युदरमपि न गृह्येत। तस्मात्स्वतन्त्रोऽर्थः सर्वपुरुषसाधारणः, स्वतन्त्राणि च चित्तानि प्रतिपुरुषं प्रवर्तन्ते। तयोः संबन्धादुपलब्धिः पुरुषस्य भोग इति॥१६॥**

 If an object is dependent on a single mind then, if the mind is distracted or restrained, the object would not be touched by that mind; it is not in objective relationship with any other (mind); it would not be cognised, i.e., its nature would not be grasped by any (mind); at that time what (can be said) about its existence?

 And when it comes into relationship with the mind again, from where will it come into existence? Moreover, those parts of an object which are not in contact with the mind would not exist; thus, if one says that there is no back then how could the stomach (in front) be known?

 Therefore, the object is independent (of the mind) and is common to all purposes; the minds are also independent (of the object) and they function for the respective puruṣa (self). By the relationship between the two there is knowledge (perception), which is experience of the puruṣa (self).

 इतश्च चित्ततन्त्रता वस्तुनो नावकल्पते। एकचित्ततन्त्रं वा वस्तु भवेदनेकचित्ततन्त्रं वा ? एकचित्ततन्त्रत्वे ब्रूमः—न चैकचित्ततन्त्रं वस्तु तदप्रमाणकं तदा किं स्यात् ? न तावदेकचित्ततन्त्रं, एकचित्ततन्त्रं चेद्वस्तु स्यात् यदिचेदमुच्यते, तच्चित्ते यच्चित्ततन्त्रं वस्तु तस्मिंश्चित्ते व्यग्रे परासक्ते निरुद्धे वा विनष्टे वा तेन प्रमाणचित्तेन अपरामृष्टं च अन्यस्प चाविषयीभूतं एकचित्ततन्त्रतयैव, तदा तत् वस्तु अप्रमाणकमगृहीतस्वभावं प्रमाणचित्तनिरोधादेव तदानीं किं तत् स्यात्। न हि किंचिदपि स्यात्। चित्तप्रमाणकं तत्, तदभावे न तेन भवितव्यम्॥

 From what has been said the dependence of the object on the mind is not possible. Is the object dependent on one mind or dependent on many minds? In case it is dependent on one mind then we can say *na caikacittatantram vastu tadapramāṇakam tadā kiṃsyāt?*

 It (the object) is not dependent on one mind. “ekacittatantram ”if it is said so, then when the mind on which the object is dependent is attached to something else or when it is restricted (lost) it will not be known by the connected mind and will not be the object of another (mind) as it is already dependent on one mind; then, that object (will not be cognised) because of the restraint of the mind connected with it; “tadānīm syāt”= then there will be nothing; it is dependent on the authority of the mind and in its absence it cannot exist.

 Objection—But then, when the mind which cognises it is restricted, similarly the object also being momentary is also restricted (goes out of existence). Then what is there to be known (denoted) then.

 Answer—That is not so; as there will be cessation of activity and it is not in consonance with reason. This is fire do not touch it', 'Take this', 'Give me that' —thus all these day-to-day activities will cease to be, as the object will be destroyed along with the single mind (which knows it).

   Objection—But then, that which arises in its series (flow) which is very similar (to it) will serve the purpose of knowledge for worldly activity.

   Answer—Here also it is only through something else which is like it in the series that one is to experience it and as for the authority of another, who will decide that it is pertaining to the same object. There is no reason for this rule[^861].

[^861]: # "The mind being different and part of a series there is no guarantee it is the same, nor is there any guarantee that it will attend to the same object."

  Moreover, being dependent on one mind, at the time of activity the object of support giving rise to knowledge of something existing at the moment (something specific) is different and so the knowledge of something else is not correct[^616].

[^616]: "The mind on which the object is dependent is no more, then the knowledge of the object when that object is no more, cannot be taken to be the same."

   Nor is the object dependent on many minds. In that case how can we function through such statements as 'Take hold of this', 'Give me that[^617]'Nor can those who think in this manner, (i.e., such philosophers) function mutually as preceptor and disciples through giving instruction and so on.

[^617]: "There will be great confusion as to which mind governs which object and there can be no activity."

   Thus (therefore) the object is not dependent on one mind, as when the knowing mind is no more or when it is occupied elsewhere, the nature of the object is not known. “sambadhyamānaṃ. . utpadyeta[^618]”(when it comes into relationship with the object again, from where will it come into existence)? i.e., its coming into existence from anywhere from its own series does not fit in, this is what we have to say.

[^618]: "The bhāṣya reading available is “saṃbadhyamānam ca”whereas the Vivaraṇa has “sambadhyamānam"

  Moreover, those parts of this object which are not the objects of that single knowledge “bhāgā.. syuḥ”= (they will not exist). It is only one portion of the object which has become the object, dependent on (one) imind and not the other (portion). “nāsti’ syādeva”(if there is no back then even the stomach which is in front of one's eyes cannot exist).

 अथापि काकतालीयन्यायेन भूयांसि चित्तानि युगपदुत्पद्येरन् तद्विषयं च वस्तु तत्समानकालमुन्मज्जतीति, तदेतेनैव पृष्ठोदराभावनिदर्शनेन प्रत्याख्यायि। नापि काकतालीयवृत्तान्तेनानादिसमयाधीनो व्यवहारसागर उत्तीर्यते। सर्वे च विज्ञानदर्शनश्लाघिषु दोषा इहापि समाना एव॥

  Objection—But then, by the reasoning of the crow and the palm tree[^619] that denotes an unexpected and coincidental occurrence like a crow sitting on the branch of a palm tree and a palm fruit falling on its head at the same moment.")let there be the coming into being of many minds at the same time and let their respective objects also disappear at the same time as the minds (by the same nyāya).

[^619]: "The maxim (nyāya

  Answer—That has been rejected by this example of the (non-perception of the) back leading to the absence of the stomach (which is seen). Nor can the ocean of worldly activity which is based on beginningless time be crossed by the narration of the (reasoning of the) crow and the palm tree. All the defects which are present in

those who applaud the doctrine of Vijñānavāda are common to this theory also.

 “tasmāt”= Therefore he says “svatantrah bhogaḥ”(the object is independent and common to all people) and in its existence all worldly activity is planned. (Minds are also independent and they function for the respective puruṣas.) (Experience of puruṣa is the knowledge due to the relationship) between the object and the mind. Therefore the puruṣa is the experiencer, the mind is the instrument and the 'thing' is that which is the object; thus the paths of these-the experiencer, the instrument and the object are different.

**तदुपरागापेक्षित्वाच्चित्तस्य वस्तु ज्ञाताज्ञातम्॥१७॥**

 An object is either known or not known by the mind, depending upon whether it is affected (coloured) (or not affected) by it (the object).

** अयस्कान्तमणिकल्पा विषया अयःसधर्मकं चित्तमभिसंबध्योपरञ्जयन्ति, येन च विषयेणोपरक्तं चित्तं स विषयो ज्ञातस्ततोऽन्यः पुनरज्ञातः। वस्तुनो ज्ञाताज्ञातस्वरूपत्वात्परिणामि चित्तम्॥१७॥**

 Objects of the (various sense-organs) are like magnet(s); the mind is similar in quality to iron (filings); (the objects) binding themselves to it (the mind), colour it. That object by which the mind gets affected is known (by the mind); that which is different from this is the unknown. Because the nature of an object is known (at times) and not known (at times) the mind is changeful (subject to change).

  कथं चित्ततद्विषययोः सम्बन्धात् पुरुषस्य भोग इत्याह—यद्वा, यस्य चित्तव्यतिरेकेण वस्तु नास्ति, चित्ततन्त्रमेव वा वस्तु, तस्य ज्ञाताज्ञातविषयत्वमनुपपन्नमित्याह—तदुपरागापेक्षत्वाच्चित्तस्य वस्तु ज्ञाताज्ञातम्। तेन विषयेण चित्तस्योपरागः तं प्रति अपेक्षा यस्य(तत्)चित्तं तदुपरागापेक्षम्, तस्य भावः तदुपरागापेक्षत्वं तस्मात् तदुपरागापेक्षत्वाच्चित्तस्य वस्तु ज्ञाताज्ञातम्॥

 How is there the experience of puruṣa by the relationship of the mind and its object? He says—or else for one for whom there is not object apart from the knowledge of it, or the object is only dependent on the mind, for him it is not correct to say that (the mind has) the object known or not known. Thus he says *taduparāgāpekṣatvāccittasya vastu jñātājñātam[^862]*. By that object the mind is coloured; that which has some expectation towards that (object) is such a mind which is *taduparāgāpekṣam*.

[^862]: # "The available reading is 'apekṣitvā ’while the Vivaraṇa has '. apekṣatvā."

  That state is *taduparāgāpekṣatvam*. Because of that *vastu jñātājñātam*.

 That object by which the mind[^863]is coloured is *jñātam*(known) and that (object) by which it is not coloured is *ajñātam*(not known). And that colouring is the requirement for the change of the mind.The mind through the sense-organs, changing into the form of the outside object gets connected with it.

[^863]: # "The change into the form of knowledge."

 What is the cause for the change of the mind? He says (in answer) “ayaskānta. cittam”= (the objects) are similar to magnets and (the mind) having qualities similar to iron (fillings) is disturbed in the presence of the object(s). The similarity of the objects to magnets is also because by their mere presence they have the capacity to make the mind disturbed. Then the objects (get connected) with the mind which has changed into their shapes (and colour it).

 “yena cittam”; that object (which affects the mind) is known and that which is different from it is the object that does not colour it which is “ajñātaḥ”Therefore because (the object has the nature of being known at times and unknown at other times) (the mind is changeful).

 Then those who argue that the object is dependent on the mind or that the object is itself the mind have to be knowers of all objects or devoid of any object; for there is no mind which has its object unknown. One does not see this. Why is that? We only know (perceive) a mind as having an object known or unknown. And that means this—objects which exist in a fixed state (in the mind) are not obtained, on the other hand one cannot imagine the connection (between the two); (therefore) that which has change needs the change of the mind[^620].

[^620]: "This is the only explanation possible under the circumstances."

** यस्य तु तदेव चित्तं विषयस्तस्य—**

 As for that (the puruṣa) whose object is that mind itself—

**सदा ज्ञाताश्चित्तवृत्तयस्तत्प्रभोः पुरुषस्यापरिणामित्वात्॥१८॥**

 The modifications of the mind are always known to its master, the puruṣa, because of its unchanging nature.

** यदि चित्तवत्प्रभुरपि पुरुषः परिणमेत् ततस्तद्विषयाश्चित्तवृत्तयः शब्दादिविषयवज्ज्ञाताज्ञाताः स्युः। सदाज्ञातत्वं तु मनसस्तत्प्रभोः पुरुषस्यापरिणामित्वमनुमापयति॥१८॥**

 If the master, the puruṣa also changes (its nature) like the mind, then the modifications of the mind, which are its objects, would be known (at times) and unknown (at times) like the objects of the senses, sounds &c. But the fact of the mind being known at all times by its master, the puruṣa, makes one infer its unchangeability.

 यस्य तु स्वामिनो भोक्तुः तदेव ज्ञाताज्ञातविषयं चित्तं वृत्तिरूपेण विषयः न हि निरुद्धवृत्तिनश्चेतसो विषयत्वमिति, तस्य पुरुषस्य सदा ज्ञाताश्चित्तवृत्तयः (तत्प्रभोः पुरुषस्यापरिणामित्वात्)। तासां प्रत्यक्षत्वात् सदा ज्ञातविषयत्वमप्रसाध्यम् ॥

 अपि च, भवति हि कदाचिज्ज्ञातः सन्नर्थो ज्ञात इति (प्रतीयमानः)। चित्तवृत्तिप्रत्यक्षाग्राह्यत्वे (तत्) नोपपद्यते। न च फलद्वारेणानुमातुं तत्र शक्यते। फलस्यानवधारणात्॥

  तस्मात् संशयस्य चाविषयत्वात्, पृथक् च विषयाच्चित्तवृत्तीनां स्वरूपमात्रेणैव स्मर्यमाणत्वात्, सर्वदा सर्वाः प्रत्यक्षाश्चित्तवृत्तयः। तथा प्रतिपत्तुरवभासकत्वात्, करणत्वात्, अभिव्यञ्जकत्वाच्च, प्रदीपादिवत्। न तु चक्षुरादिभिरनैकान्तिकत्वम्। तत्रापि प्रत्यक्षग्राह्यत्वात्। यथा प्रदीपाद्यालोकविशिष्टा घटादयो गृह्यन्ते, तथा श्रोत्रादिस्वालोकविशिष्टय एव शब्दादयो गृह्यन्ते॥

 “yasya tu[^864]”= (that same mind) whose object is (sometimes) known and (sometimes) unknown is the object of that experiencer, the master, in the form of modification (of the mind), i.e., the mind which has its modifications restricted has no object; that puruṣa *sadā jñātāścittavṛttayaḥ* \[tatprabhoḥ puruṣasyāparināmitvāt[^621]\].As they are perceived directly it is not necessary to prove that the object is known at all times.

[^621]: "In the Vivaraṇa text this portion is in brackets suggesting that the sūtra was not quoted in full."

[^864]: # "Introduction to sūtra IV.18."

 Or else the modifications of the mind can be understood to be directly perceived as one is aware of them as perceived without the help of any indicatory word similar to the direct knowledge (perception) of a pot. And thus it has the form of certainty and is not the object of doubt. If the modifications of the mind are always not perceived directly then they will also be at sometime doubted[^622],like outside objects. But one does not see them at any time being in the field of doubt[^623].

[^622]: " Their presence will be doubted at times similar to that of outside objects."

[^623]: "The mind's modifications are always known and are never doubted as to whether they exist or not."

 Moreover, sometimes an object being known (the feeling of its being known) cannot be explained if there is no acceptance of direct perception of the modification of the mind. Nor is it possible, in this case, to infer it through the result as the result cannot be observed.

  Therefore as they are not objects of doubt, the objects of the modifications of the mind are different (in general[^624])and one is aware of them having their own nature; thus all modifications of the mind are directly perceived at all times. In this manner it is the illumination (knowledge) of one who grasps (knows), it is an instrument and it is a revealer like a lamp. And there is no uncertainty in the sense-organs like the eyes, etc., as there also there is knowledge by direct perception. Just as pots, etc., are perceived, qualified by the light of a lamp, similarly sound, etc., are grasped (known) qualified by the illumination in the ears, etc[^625].

[^624]: " Modifications of the mind are not like doubts nor are they like outside objects."

[^625]: "Through the predominance of sattva in the sense-organs of knowledge there is the capacity to illumi their respective objects."

 Nor can it be said that there is no direct perception since there is no knowledge by separation[^626]. Just as the flames of two lamps are mutually different but there is no separation as this is the flame of this one (lamp) and this is the flame of this other lamp and there is no lack of direct perception of those because of that, similarly here also the eyes, etc., having relationship to outside light which is of the same nature, there is no knowledge by separation. Nor by that alone can one say that they are not directly perceived.

[^626]: "In direct perception there is no feeling of distinction between the object perceived and the respective sense-organs."

 Anyone who rejects the modification of the mind culminating in direct perception is in fact rejecting himself, as the perception (knowledge) of everyone is dependent on the modification of the mind similar to perception (knowledge) of colour being dependent on the knowledge of light[^627].Therefore it is said *sadā jñātāścittavṛttayaḥ puruṣasya.*

[^627]: "Light being essential to make the object visible. Thus no colour can be perceived in darkness."

 And this matter of being known at all times *tatprabhoḥ puruṣasyāpariṇāmitvāt.tat* is used for its nature of being the constant (eternal) knower (perceiver); “yadi syuḥ”, i.e., the collection of objects like sound, etc. (sometimes) known and (sometimes) unknown is to be seen to depend on the mutuations of the changeful mind. Similarly it is seen that having objects (sometimes) known and unknown depends on the changes of the sense-organs also; but being known and not being known is not the case of any one of the modifications of the mind. Because it is permanent the modifications of the mind are always known to it. Therefore (the mind) in the form of modifications “sadājñātatvam ..anumāpayati[^628]”.

[^628]: "The bhāṣya has been quoted and nothing new is added to the bhāṣya."

 The conclusion is 'puruṣa is without change' The indicatory mark is 'because he has the object known at all times' The mind and the sense-organs are dissimilar examples. The possessor of the object, i.e., the perceiver being the subject under discussion, it is not proper to give the example, ‘like the liberated ātman' in order to reject having the object known at all times, as one liberated has no perception of the object[^629].

[^629]: "In the sense of subject and object as we understand it in the worldly sense."

  **स्यादाशङ्का चित्तमेव स्वाभासं विषयाभासं च भविष्यत्यग्निवत्—**

  A doubt may arise that the mind itself like fire, illumines itself and the object; (this is the belief of the Vaināśikas who believe in the mind as the ultimate).

**न तत्स्वाभासं दृश्यत्वात्॥१९॥**

   It cannot illumine itself as it is an object fit to be known.

   **यथेतराणीन्द्रियाणि शब्दादयश्च दृश्यत्वान्न स्वाभासानि तथा मनोऽपि प्रत्येतव्यम्।**

** न चाग्निरत्र दृष्टान्तः। न ह्यग्निरात्मस्वरूपमप्रकाशं प्रकाशयति। प्रकाशश्चायं प्रकाश्यप्रकाशकसंयोगे दृष्टः। न च स्वरूपमात्रेऽस्ति संयोगः। किञ्च स्वाभासं चित्तमित्यग्राह्यमेव कस्यचिदिति शब्दार्थः। तद्यथा—स्वात्मप्रतिष्ठमाकाशं न परप्रतिष्ठमित्यर्थः। स्वबुद्धिप्रचारप्रतिसंवेदनात्सत्त्वानां प्रवृत्तिर्दृश्यते—क्रुद्धोहं भीतोऽहममुत्र मे रागोऽमुत्र मे क्रोध इति। एतत्स्वबुद्धेरग्रहणे न युक्तमिति॥१९॥**

 Just as other sense-organs and (objects such as) sounds &c., are not self-illuminating on account of being fit to be known, in a similar way, the mind also should be understood. Fire is no example here. For fire does not illuminate its own self which was non-luminous (before). And this illumination is seen (only) when there is a relationship (contact) between that which is illuminated and that which is the illuminator. And there can be no such contact with its own nature. Moreover, the meaning of the words 'the mind illumines itself' is that the mind is not perceived (cognised) by any one.

 Thus this is the same as (saying) 'Ākāśa is self-supporting; it is not supported by another.' One sees activity of living beings as based on the consciousness of the processes of their own intellects (thinking substances) as when they say 'I am angry', 'I am afraid', 'I feel attached to that person', 'I am angry with that person' This (purposive activity) cannot be explained unless there is a knowledge of one's own intellect.

 “syādāśanka. agnivat[^865]”, i.e. (the mind is itself the) known object and one who knows the object. The modifications have forms which are known to oneself; just as the lamp illumines both the objects like pot, etc., (objects) and itself as well. So what is the purpose of imagining a puruṣa which, different from the mind, grasps the modifications of the mind.

[^865]: # "The introduction to IV.19. The bhāṣya as available has “bhaviṣyatyagnivat” while the Vivaraṇa has “bhaviṣyatītyagnivat”"

 In this context he says *na tatsvābhāsam dṛśyatvāt*. “yatheśabdādayaśca” “yathe śabdādayaśca” (the sense-organs) are like the sense of hearing, etc., (ear, etc.) and the objects are (like sound, etc.). “na svābhāsāni”, i.e., the sense-organs (are not self-illuminating); nor are the (objects-sound, etc.) self-illuminating. *drśyatvāt*. “tathā mano'pi pratyetavyam”= it should be understood that the mind is not selfilluminating because it is seen fit to be known[^630].

[^630]: "This being the reason or hetu for that."

  Objection—But then, let it be like the fire having illumination of itself and illumination of the object as well. Just as objects like pot, etc., which are to be illuminated, stand in need of another light for their perception which is not the case with a lamp, as the lamp is its own illuminator and the illuminator of the object also. Similarly, the mind also having illumination, can be like that; why is there the need of an ātman? For instance, in order to perceive one lamp people do not take the help of (a second) lamp. And in case they do take such help there will be only lack of finality[^631].In this manner if knowledge is to be grasped by a separate knowledge then that also will be grasped by another one and that again by another and thus it will be inconclusive. Moreover, since knowledge has the nature of illumination and the knower also has the nature of illumination there is no mutual relationship of assister and assisted just as in the case of relationship between two lamps. Therefore the perceiver of knowledge, even if it is imagined, is without any purpose; so let knowledge be both the illumination of oneself and the illumination of the other (object) also.

[^631]: "The first taking help from the second, the second from the third and so on ad infinitum."

 Answer—By thus taking recourse to a poor example it is not possible to get rid of ātman which is the ascending path, well-known to all. How is that? “na cāgni... prakāśayati”. If fire being non-luminous like pots, etc., would illumine through itself then the example would be appropriate; but not like this. But fire is not at any time non-luminous[^632].

[^632]: "It is the nature of fire to be so and therefore cannot be compared to objects like pots."

  प्रकाशश्चायम्। स च प्रकाश्यप्रकाशकसंयोगे दृष्टः। न च स्वरूपमात्रेऽस्ति संयोगः। द्वयोर्हि संयोगः। नासति संयोगे स्वरूपावभासकत्वम्॥

 “prakāśa . samyogah”. Illumination is (contact between the illuminator and the illuminated). Relationship is between two things. When there is no relationship there can be no illumination of itself.

 And when it is said that, like pots, etc., fire is not in need of another light (to illumine it), that is due to the absence of the form of being illuminated. It does not have a form to be illuminated like that of a pot, etc. And by that it does not mean that it is not perceived as different[^866].It is indeed perceived by the eyes which are different and similar to it[^633].

[^633]: "Thus something similar to the lamp having the property of illumination, has the capacity to grasp it as different."

[^866]: # "It is also grasped as a different object from that of illumination itself."

 In order to remove the (obscurity) darkness of (objects like) pots, etc., which are perceived (fit to be illuminated) there is recourse to light (illumination); and not be cause of the form of not being fit to be perceived[^634].You yourself have mentioned the lack of need of another light for (the perception of) fire as “two lamps do not assist each other mutually (in perceiving them)”. Even when there is a separation between two lamps they do not assist each other mutually since they do not have the form of not being perceived (illuminated); then what to say when there is no separation; it means that there is no need at all of another light in this case[^635].

[^634]: "Objects are fit to be perceived and so this is possible, not otherwise."

[^635]: "In the case of a lamp there is no need at all of a second light for perceiving it."

 Nor is there a doubt regarding perception (of them) as different (from each other[^636]),as the lamps are seen like pots, etc. By this argument it is established that knowledge, like lamps, etc., is grasped differently since it is fit to be known (like an object). Knowledge being of the nature of illumination similarly to lamps, etc., it is established that it is not in need of another means (for illumination). Thus there is no trace of the defect of lack of finality.

[^636]: "The two lamps are perceived as different objects."

 Objection—But then, it is said that knowledge has the nature of illumination and the perceiver of knowledge also has the nature of illumination; therefore mutually they do not have the relationship of assister and assisted similar to two lamps.

 Answer—This is not a defect. Similar to the eye and the lamp there is a class difference between the self and knowledge[^637].

[^637]: "The generic property is different."

 Objection—But then, the self (knower) perceives the mind through the knowledge of I; therefore both the object and subject belong to the same entity[^638].

[^638]: "In the statement “I know the pot“ there is no distinction made between the ahaṃkāra, here called citta, and the self. Hence the objection of the pūrvapakṣin."

 Answer—This is not a defect, as the mind is composed of the three guṇas[^639].Where the mind has tamas as predominant it is made an object by the other modification having the essence of sattva; this is similar to scratching the body with the hand[^640].Thus in the above case also the knower, the possessor of the object[^641],the puruṣa is different (from knowledge). By this argument that the class properties of the knower and knowledge are different (and) without parts we have replied (stated) that puruṣa is itself the perceiver and the perceived.

[^639]: "The mind has the nature of all the three components of prakṛti—sattva, rajas and tamas."

[^640]: "Both are in one sense the body but admit of being used differently. Similar is the case with the mind"

[^641]: "The possession is by reflection and not in reality though it is not so mentioned by the Vivaraṇakāra."

  “kiṃca . .śabdārthaḥ[^642]”.(Moreover) when it is said that the mind illumines itself it means that it is not illuminated by another, i.e., not perceived (by another). It is not said that it itself grasps itself. In the case of such verbal usages there is conveyed a contradictory meaning of words.

[^642]: "In the available bhāṣya reading we have “kasyacittam syāditi śabdārthaḥ“ While the Vivaraṇakāra adds “evam“ to “śabdārthaḥ“"

 “tadyathā. ityarthaḥ[^867]”,i.e., the meaning of the word is that it has no support. Similarly, the statement 'Devadatta is well' means ‘He is without illness’and not that he is established in himself.

[^867]: # "The available bhāṣya reading is “na parapratiṣtham“ whereas the Vivaraṇa has “apratiṣṭham”"

 In that context pointing out the invalidity (of the argument) (given) through the reason of dṛśyatvāt[^643]which condradicts direct perception, contradicts usage in the world and contradicts day-to-day worldly behaviour he says “svabuddhi dṛśyate[^644]”.

[^643]: "In the sūtra the mind is mentioned as an object and therefore not fit to be a knowing subject."

[^644]: "In the bhāṣya it is argued that purposeful worldly activity, both mental and physical, indicates that there is knowledge of one's own intellect."

 “kruddho'ham. .krodha”= recognising one's own intellect (knowing substance) engaging itself in such a manner, the activity of those wise, discriminating people, to get rid of anger, greed, etc., is proper. Similarly such ideas as “my mind is clear, it is tainted, it is deluded”(can also be explained[^645]). “etat yuktamiti”= without control of the activity it is not correct to say that the mind is not known[^646] are recognised and also controlled; therefore it only proves that the mind is known.").”

[^645]: "As there is consciousness of the state of the mind it logically points to its being the object known. Cf. YS, 1.10 and also bhāṣya therein."

[^646]: "Such mental activities (feelings

**एकसमये चोभयानवधारणम्॥२०॥**

  Nor can there be cognition of both at the same time.

**न चैकस्मिन्क्षणे स्वपरोभयावधारणं युक्तम्। क्षणिकवादिनो यद्भवनं सैव क्रिया तदेव च कारकमित्यभ्युपगमः॥२०॥**

 Nor is it possible to have cognition of one's own nature and the nature of another at the same moment. The theory of the Buddhists (those who believe in the momentary existence of things) is that action is the same as being and that is the same as the means-related-to-an-action (kāraka).

 अभ्युपगम्य वादोऽयम्—यद्यपि स्वाभासं विषयाभासं च मनो भवतु। तत्र दूषणम् एकसमये चोभयानवधारणम्। विषयपरिच्छेदकत्वे, नानाक्षणत्वादात्मपरिच्छेदो न युज्यते। अथ पुनरात्मानमवधारयति, न तदा विषयाभिमुखं, स्वात्मपरिच्छेदकत्वे नानाक्षणत्वात्॥

अथोभयपरिच्छित्तिरेकैवेति चेत्र, निरवयवत्वात् परिच्छित्तेः। न हि निरवयवायाश्चित्तवृत्तेः प्रदीपवदनेकावभासकत्वं युक्तम्। अवयवभेदात्तु प्रदीपस्यानेकप्रकाशकत्वं संभवति। न तु ज्ञानस्य सावयवत्वंपरैरभ्युपेयते॥

किं च, ज्ञानमेकमेकस्मिन् क्षणे उभयमवधारयतीति चाभ्युपगमे क्रियाकारकभेदप्रसङ्गः। यदुभयावधारणं सा क्रिया। यदवधारयति तत् कारकम्। न चैकस्मिन् क्षणे स्वपरोभयावधारणं क्षणवादिनो युक्तम्। कस्मात्? उक्तं हि क्षणिकत्वसिद्धये यद्भवनम् उत्पत्तिः सैव क्रिया तदेव च कारकमित्यभ्युपगमः। क्रियाकारकभेदे च क्षणभङ्गभङ्गः स्यात्। कारकेण हि क्रियाक्षणमवस्थानीयम्॥२०॥

 Accepting this argument let us say that the mind illumines both itself and its object. Then there is the (following) defect, i.e., *ekasamaye cobhayānavadhāraṇam.*When the object is accurately defined, since it takes many moments (to do so), it not logical for the self (mind) to be accurately defined. Similarly, when the self (mind) is accurately defined it does not face the object at that time, since it takes many moments to accurately define itself.

 Objection—If it is said that the accurate definition of both is one and the same (then) the answer is—it is not so, as accurate definition has no parts. It is not proper to consider a modification of the mind which has no parts to be able to illuminate many things like a lamp. Due to a difference in parts it is possible for a lamp to illumine many things. But knowledge having parts is not accepted by others (the opponents).

 Moreover if one accepts that a single knowledge knows (ascertains) both at the same moment there will be the difficulty of the distinction between an action and an agent. That which is an ascertainment of both is an action. That which ascertains is an agent, (related to an action). “na caikasmin yuktam[^868]”.Why (cannot there be cognition of both at the same time)? It is said that in order to prove (the theory of) momentariness “yadbhavanam”= that which comes into being “saivakriyā tadeva ca kārakamityabhyupagamaḥ”(is the same as action, the same as the means related-to-an-action[^647]).

[^647]: "Cf. bhāṣya under IV. 20."

[^868]: # "The reading available is “svapararūpāvadhāraṇam” whereas here it is “svaparobhayāvadhāraṇam”Similarly it is “kṣaṇikavādinah” in available texts whereas it is “kṣaṇavādino"

 If there is a distinction between the action and means-related-to-an-action (agent) then there will be rejection by destroying (the theory of) momentariness. It is indeed through the means-related-to-an-action (agent) that the moment of action is established[^648].

[^648]: "Thus they have to be located in different moments and not simultaneously in the same moment."

** स्यान्मतिः, स्वरसनिरुद्धं चित्तं चित्तान्तरेण समनन्तरेण गृह्यत इति—**

 There may be the opinion that a mind restrained in itself may be cognised by another mind immediately contiguous to it; (then)

**चित्तान्तरदृश्ये बुद्धिबुद्धेरतिप्रसङ्गः स्मृतिसंकरश्च॥२१॥**

 If it is cognised by another mind there will be a lack of finality from one intellect to another; and there will be confusion of memory as well.

 **अथ चित्तं चेच्चित्तान्तरेण गृह्येत बुद्धिबुद्धिः केन गृह्यते, साप्यन्यया साप्यन्ययेत्यतिप्रसङ्गः, स्मृतिसंकरश्च, यावन्तो बुद्धिबुद्धीनामनुभवास्तावत्यः स्मृतयः प्राप्नुवन्ति। तत्संकराच्चैकस्मृत्यनवधारणं च स्यादिति। एवं बुद्धिप्रतिसंवेदिनं पुरुषमपलपद्भिर्वैनाशिकैः सर्वमेवाकुलीकृतम्।**

 In case one mind is cognised by another mind by whom will the intellect of the intellect be perceived? Since this would be by another and that also by another there would be a lack of finality; and there would be a confusion of memory.

 And the confusion of memory is like this—there will be as many memories as there are experiences (cognition) of the many intellects. And as a result of the confusion (of memories) there will be lack of certainty of a particular memory. Thus, in this way, by rejecting puruṣa who knows by reflection of the intellect, the Vaināsikas (Buddhists) have confused everything.

 ते तु भोक्तृस्वरूपं यत्र क्वचन कल्पयन्तो न न्यायेन संगच्छन्ते। केचित्तु सत्त्वमात्रमपि परिकल्प्यास्ति स सत्त्वो य एतान्पञ्च स्कन्धान्निक्षिप्यान्यांश्च प्रतिसन्दधातीत्युक्त्वा तत एव पुनस्त्रस्यन्ति। तथा स्कन्धानां महानिर्वेदाय विरागायानुत्पादाय प्रशान्तये गुरोरन्तिके ब्रह्मचर्यं चरिष्यामीत्युक्त्वा सत्त्वस्य पुनः सत्त्वमेवापहुवते। सांख्ययोगादयस्तु प्रवादाः स्वशब्देन पुरुषमेव स्वामिनं चित्तस्य भोक्तारमुपयन्तीति॥२१॥

  Furthermore, they who imagine the (bhoktṛ) experiencer (self) in some places, are not logical (in their thought). There are some who assume 'being as such and say that this 'being' is the one that discards those five 'skandhas' (divisions of being) and takes on (puts together) other (skandhas). Then having said this they are afraid of this 'being'

 Similarly, they say that in order to feel total disgust towards the said five skandhas and for the sake of their non-production and calmness they would go to a teacher (guru) and lead the life of a brahmacārī (disciple); having said that they deny, after all, the existence of the being.

 But the schools headed by Sāńkhya and Yoga denote by the word 'sva' the existence of puruṣa the master, who is the experiencer of the mind.

 “syānmatiḥ” It is possible (to argue) according to another “svarasa .gṛhyate[^869]”,= that the perishable thought destroyed out of existence is grasped “cittāntareṇa samanantarena gṛhyate”= (by another thought) which arises (immediately after it) and so the imagining of an eternal stable puruṣa is useless. The answer to that is cittāntaradṛśye. .saṅkaraśca[^649].

[^649]: "The answer is the sūtra itself."

[^869]: # "'The reading in the bhāṣya is “svarasaniruddham”but in the Vivaraṇa text it is given “svarasasanniruddham”"

 “yadi cittam[^650]”= An earlier thought restrained in itself is grasped by a laterthought which arises immediately after it. “buddhibuddhiḥ”= the thought pertaining to the object pot (for instance) is called the thought and that which has this thought as object is the thought of the thought (buddhibuddhi). “kena gṛhyate“ = by whom will that thought be grasped as there is no fixed knower (for that). “sā’pyanyayā . prasaṅgaḥ” = that is to be grasped (by another thought) (and that by another thought; thus there will be no finality).

[^650]: "The reading in available texts is “atha cittam .”and not “yadi cittam."

 And when the thoughts of the thoughts are not grasped, action will not be logical as memory and latent-impressions will not be applicable[^651]. In that state there will be a huge garland of thoughts of pot-thoughts without any finality but there will be no pot-thought. And when there is no end to the thoughts of pot-thought from where will the idea of pot, etc., come into being?

[^651]: " Which memory and which latent impression is responsible for the action. This will become difficult to assess"

 There is this additional defect, i.e., “smṛtisaṅkaraśca”. As there is a correspondence between the thoughts of thoughts and their subliminal-impressions what results is confusion in memory. “yāvantaḥ.
prāpnuvanti[^652]”,i.e. (memories are) confused. “tatsaṅkarāt” = because of confusion in memory[^653]“smṛtyanavadhāraṇam”= when there is no certainty in the form 'this is the memory of this (particular) thought' how can there be worldly activity. And thus due to correspondence (between memory and subliminal-impression) what results is confusion in memory. (And) all those many thoughts (ideas) of the thoughts of thoughts not being able to enter into worldly activity unaccompanied by its (respective) thought and its memory, everything will be grasped through confusion[^654].If, with the intention of avoiding lack of finality we decide on a last idea “buddhipratisaṃvedinam puruṣam . jagaditi[^655]”, which is very clear due to the mark (reason) of being the knower (witness) by reflection of the idea (the Buddhists have confused the world by rejecting (that) puruṣa).

[^652]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add much to what the bhāṣya has already stated."

[^653]: "Since all thoughts are alike, which subliminal-impression is giving rise to which memory will be difficult to establish."

[^654]: " As there will be no definite one-to-one-correspondence between knowledge, memory and subsequent action the result will be utter confusion."

[^655]: "The reading in the bhāṣya has “svarvamevākulīkṛtam”whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “ākulīkṛtamjagaditi”"

 Objection—But then, we can remove the defect of lack of finality by imagining a bed of ideas; and thus we can reject the idea of a permanent ātman (self).

 Answer—“te bhoktṛ saṅgacchante”= in that case also since the bed of ideas is to be grasped and has no finality it will be tinged with all the earlier mentioned defects.

 “kecit. trasyanti” = some Buddhists imagine differently a being of the nature of an experiencer; (that existing being) discards the five collections which are described as that of rūpa, vedanā, saṃjñā, saṃskāra, and vijñāna[^656],and then it takes on other collections. (Having said this) “tata eva trasyati”= since they accept past and not-yet-manifested collections, they shy away from accepting (imagining) a single being[^657].

[^656]: "The five collections which constitute the essence of a person according to the Buddhists. These are the collections of matter, feeling, perception, mental construction and consciousness."

[^657]: "What is accepted in a round about manner can be achieved by assuming the existence of a single permanent being says the Vivaraṇakāra"

 “teṣām . . . apahnuvate[^658]”. There is this other contradictory view. Saying that 'I shall lead the life of a brahmacārī[^659]’, they deny the relation between the end and its

means[^870] to achieve the end (calmness).");according to them there is only vijñāna, (consciousness) which is momentary and śūnya (void) and there is no being[^660]. “sāṅkhya. upanayantīti[^661]”.

[^660]: "Reference here being both to the Vijñānavāda and Mādhyamika schools of Buddhism."

[^661]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything new to what Vyāsa has already said."

** कथम्—**  
 How is this so?

**चितरेप्रतिसंक्रमायास्तदाकारापत्तौ स्वबुद्धिसंवेदनम्॥२२॥**

 Consciousness, without any activity, knows its own intellect when it obtains by reflection a oneness with the mind.

** अपरिणामिनी हि भोक्तृशक्तिरप्रतिसंक्रमा च, परिणामिन्यर्थं प्रतिसंक्रान्तेव तद्वृत्तिमनुपतति, तस्याश्च प्राप्तचैतन्योपग्रहस्वरूपाया बुद्धिवृत्तेरनुकारमात्रतया बुद्धिवृत्त्यविशिष्टा हि ज्ञानवृत्तिराख्यायते। तथा चोक्तम्—**

 The power of the experiencer is indeed unchanging and it has no movement (of coming into contact with objects); it seems to unite with something mutable (the modifications of the mind) (and) it takes on the form of the modifications of the mind. And that which is identified with the modifications of the mind (intellect) is called a modification of consciousness (knowledge) just by being an imitation of the modification of the intellect which has been enlivened by the reflection of consciousness (puruṣa).

 Thus it is said—'Neither pātāla (underworld) nor the mountain-cave, nor darkness, nor the hidden caverns of the seas are the caves in which the eternal Brahman is hidden: the wise say that it is the modification of the intellect when it is identical with Him'

“katham”, i.e., how does the word "sva” denote the experiencer**¹**. Because*citerapra saṃvedanam[^662]*when (there is a oneness by reflection with the mind without any activity) there is (knowledge of one's own intellect). *citiḥ*= puruṣa that is consciousness. And that is *apratisaṃkramā* because it is unchanging. Though that consciousness is unchanging there is *tadākārāpattiḥ*. *tat* stands for the mind under discussion and its obtaining a oneness with it[^663]is *tadākārāpattiḥ*.

[^662]: "The sūtra is the answer."

[^663]: "Oneness with the mind."

 When that consciousness obtains a oneness with the mind there is *svabuddhi*-*saṃvedanam*, i.e., there is knowledge of one's own intellect (modification of them mind). And it is for its sake that the intellect (mind) transforms itself in the form of (sensual) knowledge like sound, etc[^664] that all these various sensual experiences are there.").

 He (Vyāsa) explains that as “apariṇāminī. and so on. The power of the seer is as already explained[^665]. Though it has no movement it appears to unite with “pariṇāminyarthe" = the modification of the mind as it is the object of the knower; “tadvṛpatantī”**⁶**obtaining seership (it takes on, as it were, the form of the modification of the mind). The modification of the mind, while coming into being, itself takes on the form of its (seer's) object. The experiencer obtaining that modification of the mind (knowledge of, the intellect) becomes united with it.

 “tasyā rūpāyāḥ" = that modification of the mind which has become one with the form of puruṣa[^666]is like a red-hot-iron ball which has become one with fire only due to being an object of the seer, "anukāramātratayā" = because of (puruṣa) being one with the modification of the intellect[^667] (during experience).

 Only when there is a difference between one who experiences and that which is experienced is it proper to talk about becoming one with the modification of the mind. When there is no different experiencer then there will be an appearance of the mind being both the experiencer and the experienced inadvertantly. Therefore it is well said “sāṅkhya. yanti[^670]”. Whereas others, though conceding (an experiencer) using other words[^671]are afraid of it (are afraid of doing so). Thus it is said—due to imitating the modification of the mind (intellect) the modification as knowledge is obtained in the mind (intellect) alone and nowhere else. “na pātālam vedayante”^(**5**).pātāla, etc., are not the caves. That cave in which the eternal Brahman (is hidden) that is the cave and not these pātāla (underworld) and so on. In answer to the question as to which is the cavern it is hidden in he says—the wise understand that called ātman or brahman, which is not different from the modification of the intellect[^672].

[^672]: "That is itself the self and not any other cave where the self is hidden."

** अतश्चैतदभ्युपगम्यते—**

 From that we reach this conclusion—

**द्रष्टृदृश्योपरक्तं चित्तं सर्वार्थम्॥२३॥**

 The mind coloured by the seer and the seen grasps all objects.

** मनो हि मन्तव्येनार्थनोपरक्तम्। तत्स्वयं च विषयत्वाद्विषयिणा पुरुषेणात्मीयया वृत्त्याभिसंबद्धम्। तदेतच्चितमेव द्रष्टृदृश्योपरक्तं विषयविषयिनिर्भासं चेतनाचेतनस्वरूपापन्नं विषयात्मकमप्यविषयात्मकमिवाचेतनं चेतनमिव स्फटिकमणिकल्पं सर्वार्थमित्युच्यते।**

 The mind is coloured by the object of thought. And that (mind) itself, being an object, is connected with the subjective puruṣa by modification as self. Then it is this mind alone which is coloured by (both) the seer and the seen and shining as the object and the subject, it assumes the form of being both conscious and unconscious. Though being of the essence of an object it appears to be the essence of 'not object'; though not conscious it appears to be conscious; and similar to a crystal it is said to grasp all objects.

**तदनेन चित्तसारूप्येण भ्रान्ताः केचित्तदेव चेतनमित्याहुः। अपरे चित्तमात्रमेवेदं सर्वं नास्ति खल्वयं गवादिर्घटादिश्च सकारणो लोक इति। अनुकम्पनीयास्ते। कस्मात्? अस्ति हि तेषां भ्रान्तिबीजं सर्वरूपाकारनिर्भासं चित्तमिति। समाधिप्रज्ञायां प्रज्ञेयोऽर्थः प्रतिबिम्बीभूतस्तस्यालम्बनीभूतत्वादन्यः। स चेदर्थश्चित्तमात्रं स्यात्कथं प्रज्ञयैव प्रज्ञारूपमवधार्यत। तस्मात्प्रतिबिम्बीभूतोर्थः प्रज्ञायां येनावधार्यते**

**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**5.**The reading in available texts is “na ca vivaram” whereas the reading here is “no vivaram". Instead of "naivāndhakāram" in available texts the Vivaraṇa has "naivāndhakāraḥ".

**स पुरुष इति। एवं ग्रहीतृग्रहणग्राह्यस्वरूपचित्तभेदात्त्रयमप्येतज्जातितः प्रविभजन्ते ते सम्यग्दर्शिनस्तैरधिगतः पुरुष इति॥२३॥**

 Some who are deceived by this resemblance to the mind say that it (the mind) itself is conscious; there are others who say that all this world along with its causes is only the mind (and) there is no object like the cow &c., (or) pot &c., they are to be pitied.

 Why so? Because the mind which shines in the form of all objects is the seed of their illusion. In the state of insight during 'samādhi' the object of (samādhi) insight which is reflected (in the mind), is different (from the insight) because it is the object on which the insight rests. If that object is only the mind then how could the form of (samādhi) insight be ascertained by the insight itself ? Therefore, that by which the object reflected in (samādhi) insight is ascertained, is puruṣa. In this way, they who divide the mind in its (three) forms on the basis of three classes as the knower, the means of knowledge and the object of knowledge are the people with true insight. Puruṣa has been realised by them.

 कस्मात् पुनः कारणात् पुरुषस्य चित्ताकारापत्तिः। तस्यां वा सत्यां स्वबुद्धिसंवेदनम्। कुतो वैनाशिकानां चित्तमेव ग्राह्यं ग्राहकं चेति भ्रान्तिरित्याह—द्रष्टृदृश्योपरक्तं चित्तं सर्वार्थम्। द्रष्टा पुरुषो दृश्यं शब्दादि ताभ्याम् उपरक्तं चित्तं सर्वार्थं पुरुषस्य भोगापवर्गार्थं भवति। मनोऽभिमन्तव्येनार्थेन अयस्कान्तमणिदेशीयेन विषयेण उपरक्तं स्वयं च विषयत्वात् पुरुषस्य विषयिणा पुरुषेण सन्निहितेन आत्मीयया वृत्त्या मानसेन प्रत्ययेन विषयतया अभिसम्बद्धम्॥

 तदेतच्चित्तम् आत्मवृत्तिद्वारेण पुरुषेण सम्बन्धाद्द्रष्टुः स्वरूपोपरक्तं शब्दादिना च मन्तव्येनोपरक्तमिति द्रष्टृदृश्योपरक्तं चित्तमेव न पुरुषः। द्रष्टृदृश्योपरक्तम् इत्यस्य व्याख्यानं करोति—विषयविषयिनिर्भासं चेतनाचेतनस्वरूपापन्नम्॥

 Then what is the reason for puruṣa to assume the form of the modification of the mind? Or when that happens (why is there) the knowledge of one's own intellect? And why do the Buddhists have the confusion of the mind being both the experiencer and the experienced? He thus says (in answer) *draṣṭṛ .sarvārtham.*

* draṣṭā* is puruṣa (and) *dṛśyam* are the objects like sound, etc. (the mind coloured) by both *sarvārtham* = serves the purpose of experience and liberation of puruṣa “mano'bhi[^871]”,i.e. (the mind is coloured) by the object of thought which is like a magnet. (By being itself an object, in the proximity of) puruṣa to which it belongs it is “abhisaṃbaddham”= connected through the modification as the self to the mental thought in the form of the object[^673] and is coloured by both.").

[^673]: " puruṣa-mind-object. This mind modified into the shape of the object is itself modified as the self (due to reflection

[^871]: # "In the available texts the reading is “mano hi mantavyena” whereas here it is “mano'bhimantavyena . Similarly instead of “tatsvayam”the Vivaraṇa text has just “svayam”"

 “tadetaccittam” (this mind of such a nature) because of its connection with puruṣa through its modification as the self, is coloured by the nature of the seer; and it is also coloured by the objects of thought like sound, etc. Thus “draṣṭṛ .eva”= (the mind alone is coloured by the seer and the seen[^674])and not the puruṣa. The explanation of “draṣṭṛdṛśyoparaktam”is given as “viṣaya...rūpāpannam[^675]”.

[^674]: "The Vivaraṇakāra hardly adds anything new to what is given in the bhāṣya."

[^675]: "Again one notices the Vivaraṇakāra just repeating what is in the bhāṣya."

  But how is it that being unconscious by nature it assumes the nature of being conscious? This is no defect. Due to the constant (nitya) presence of puruṣa it appears to be conscious[^676] it appears to be conscious itself.").It is this (fact) which is called as being conscious by those without discrimination. Whereas the objects are not like that; they are forever of the nature of being unconscious (insentient). And in (by) its own nature the mind is unconscious; thus it is described as “cetanā. ” “viṣayātmakamiva”^(**2**) = and as if it is only of the nature of (objects of sense) like sound etc[^677]. “acetanam. ” = and as if it has become one with the nature of puruṣa. “sphaṭika. ”, i.e., just as the crystal in the presence of red lac, etc., takes on its colour (form), etc., similarly “tat sarvārtham”**⁴**= the mind is said (to grasp all objects).

[^676]: "As there is a constant reflection of puruṣa in the mind (intellect

[^677]: "The twofold mind which on the one hand is the seen and on the other hand is the seer, is only an object."

 Therefore “anena.”, i.e., this oneness of the mind (with the seer) is a cause of delusion for the Vaiśeṣikas[^678].The Vaiseṣikas and others with their minds deluded by the net of Indra in the form of this oneness of the mind “tadeva . . . āhuḥ”(declare the mind to be conscious). Why is this so? Because they think that the quality of consciousness which comes into being through contact between the mind and puruṣa is to be destroyed[^679]. However there is this difference from the Buddhists - they desire (believe in) a substance which is permanent[^680].

[^678]: "It is interesting to note that the Vivaraṇakāra mentions the Vaiseṣikas here. Both Vācaspati Miśra and Vijñānabhikṣu only mention the Vaināśikas in this context."

[^679]: " According to Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika, jñāna is one of the qualities of ātman which arises when the mind comes into contact with it."

[^680]: " Ātman in the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika system is one of the permanent nine padārthas."

 “apare”= the Buddhists “cittamātram[^872]. ”= deny even their own experience by stating that (all objects of experience like a cow, pot, and so on) are qualified by one's own image as all this is only a projection of the mind[^681])“te = those Buddhists who are thus deluded are foolish (and are to be pitied).

[^681]: " Reference to the Vijñānavādin."

[^872]: # "The reading available is “sakāraṇo”instead of “svākāreṇa”which the Vivaraṇakāra has."

 “kasmāt. (why are they to be pitied;) because their delusion has a cause (reason) and it is not without any reason like that of the materialists (lokāyatikā) and those who believe in the (ultimate) void[^682].These people are not to be pitied as they are working only to cheat the world. Therefore it is correctly said that those poor people whose minds are deluded with reason are to be pitied[^683].

[^682]: "The materialists and the Śūnyavādins do not believe in any permanent entity—so they are worse off according to the Vivaraṇakāra."

[^683]: " The same idea is repeated without adding anything new."

 And who are the ones who are not deluded? He answers that through the words “samādhi[^684].”and so on. The acceptance of the insight of samādhi[^685]is for the sake of acceptance of a mind without delusion. Delusion belongs to one who has a distracted mind. “samādhiprajñāyām”=in the undeluded, pure, insightful, clear depth (the object of insight is reflected) as on the round (surface) of a spotless mirror; “tasyām”= in that samādhi-insight which is the instrument[^686]“ālambanī nyaḥ”= it (object) is different from the insight, distinguished (as it is) by (the properties of) class characteristic, its nature, action, etc[^687].

[^684]: "In available readings we have “tasyālaṃbanī ”whereas the reading here is “tasyām”"

[^685]: "The insight which is identical with the samādhi state."

[^686]: "The instrument for this kind of experience."

[^687]: "In other words the object is different from the samādhi-insight because of its many properties."

 “sa. . avadhāryeta”and so on = due to an (inherent) opposition of action[^688]within the self this cannot be ascertained. “tasmāt saḥ[^689]”(therefore) that object is different from insight, “yasyām. ” (and he by whom the reflected object is known) because of being the support of that insight is different, being the agent and instrument[^690] (and) “sa puruṣaḥ”“ityevam ”and so on; since it is decided that there is distinction

[^688]: "The self cannot be both the insight and the object of insight at the same time. The kartṛ-karmavirodha principle will then come into action which is what is being referred to here."

[^689]: "The Vivaraṇakāra uses the words in the bhāṣya to connect his commentary rather than explain them himself."

[^690]: "While there is no action in puruṣa per se by the fact of reflection in buddhi, puruṣa is considered to be both the agent and instrument."

between the agent and the instrument and the object there is no single partless substance which in the same moment is the agent and the object; therefore those “trayamapye. puruṣaḥ[^873]”(are the wise men who have) realised (puruṣa). By implication it means that they (the wise) have known (puruṣa[^691]).

[^691]: "It is not correct to describe that state as knowing puruṣa because it is a oneness that is mentioned."

[^873]: # "'There is no new explanation and the bhāṣya is repeated verbatim."

** कुतश्च—**

 And for what other reason (is this so?)

**तदसंख्येयवासनाभिश्चित्रमपि परार्थं संहत्यकारित्वात्॥२४॥**

 It (the mind), though coloured by innumerable (countless) latent-impressions, exists for another, because it functions (acts) by combination (with others like the senseorgans, objects &c.).

 **तदेतच्चित्तमसंख्येयाभिर्वासनाभिरेव चित्रीकृतमपि परार्थं परस्य भोगापवर्गार्थं न स्वार्थं संहत्यकारित्वाद् गृहवत्। संहत्यकारिणा चित्तेन न स्वार्थेन भवितव्यम्। न सुखचित्तं सुखार्थम्, न ज्ञानं ज्ञानार्थम्। उभयमप्येतत्परार्थम्। यश्च भोगेनापवर्गेण चार्थनार्थवान् पुरुषः स एव परः। न परः सामान्यमात्रम्। यत्तु किञ्चित्परं सामान्यमात्रं स्वरूपेणोदाहरेद् वैनाशिकस्तत्सर्वं संहत्यकारित्वात्परार्थमेव स्यात्। यस्त्वसौ परो विशेषः स न संहत्यकारी पुरुष इति॥२४॥**

 This same mind though coloured by countless latent-impressions, exists for the sake of another, i.e., is meant for the experience or liberation (release) of another and not for oneself because its nature is to work through combination (with other things) like in the case of a house. The mind which works (acts) by combination (with other things) cannot exist for its own sake. The mental state of pleasure does not exist for the sake of pleasure; the state of knowledge does not exist for the sake of knowledge; but both these exist for the sake of another. That puruṣa whose object is served by the purpose of experience and liberation he is the other; not any other of the same class (of mind).

 Any other thing which the Vaināśikas (Buddhists) speak of in general terms only, all that will (also) only exist for another because (that also would) work in combination.

 But that special (particular) 'other' does not work by combination—that is the puruṣa.

कुतश्च अस्ति पुरुषश्चित्तव्यतिरिक्तः? पूर्वं चित्तस्य दृश्यत्वेन व्यतिरिक्तपुरुषसिद्धिरापादिता। तस्यैव तु चित्तस्य संहत्यकारित्वेनाधुना स्वामिसिद्ध्यर्थमाह—तदसङ्ख्येयवासनाचित्रमपि परार्थं संहत्यकारित्वात्॥

 यद्यपि तदेव चित्तमसंख्येयाभिर्वासनाभिः अनादिसमयाभिः चित्रीकृतं भ्रान्तिकारणमुक्तं, तथापि परार्थं परस्य भोगार्थमेवेति प्रतिज्ञायते। संहत्यकारित्वात् कार्यकरणविषयादिव्यापारापेक्षमर्थसाधकत्वात् संहत्यकारित्वम्, अतः संहत्यकारित्वात् गृहादिवत् इति पारार्थ्यं चित्तस्य। न हि किंचन लोके संहत्यकारि दृष्टं स्वार्थम्॥

 तस्मात् संहत्यकारिणा चित्तेन न स्वार्थेन भवितव्यम्। न हि सुखचित्तं सुखार्थं सुखचित्तार्थं वा। नापि ज्ञानचित्तं ज्ञानार्थं वा ज्ञानचित्तार्थं वा। किं तर्हि ? सुखचित्तं ज्ञानचित्तमपि एतदुभयं परार्थम्॥

 “kutaśca”, i.e., due to what (other) reason is the puruṣa different from the mind? Earlier[^692],due to the mind being an object (which is seen), its being different from puruṣa was understood. Now that same mind is mentioned as functioning through combination (with others like the sense-organs, etc.) for the sake of accomplishing the purpose of puruṣa. Thus it is said *tadasaṅkyeya .kāritvāt[^693]*.

[^692]: "In sutra IV.23."

[^693]: "The sūtra, reading available is. vāsanābhiścitramapi and not vāsanācitramapi. "

 Even though “tadeva. ”(the mind through the countless latent-impressions) from beginningless time “citrīkṛtam”is mentioned as the cause for delusion still “parārtham. .”it asserts (that it is for the sake of experience and liberation of another[^694]).“saṃhatyakāritvāt”; since the object (goal) is accomplished with the help of (depending on) the function of objects, instruments and action it functions by combination. Therefore “saṃhatya. ”and so on (denotes) the mind's functioning for the sake of another. In the world one does not experience any combination functioning for its own sake[^695].

[^694]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything new."

[^695]: "By its very nature that is not possible for in such a case the definition of svārtha itself is difficult."

 Therefore “saṃhatyakāriṇā . ”and so on[^696].The mind which has pleasure (mental state of pleasure is not) “sukhārtham”(for the sake of pleasure) nor for the sake of the mental state of pleasure; “nāpi[^874] .” “jñānārtham” = (nor is it) for the sake of knowledge nor for the sake of the mental state of cognition. Why is this so? The mental state of pleasure and the mental state of knowledge “etadubhayam”(are both for the sake of another).

[^696]: "The Vivaraṇakāra just repeats the bhāṣya without adding anything new. “"

[^874]: # "While available readings have “na jñānam” the reading here is “na jñānacittam”"

 “yaśca bhogena”and so on[^875].“bhogena”= through the mental state of pleasure and the mental state of knowledge. (Such a puruṣa is alone the other and) “na parasāmānya-

[^875]: # "Except the word “bhogena”no other expression has been analysed by the Vivaraṇakāra."

mātram”=(neither) the body, the sense-organs or objects[^876], the Vijñānavādins and the Vaiśeṣikas."). The Buddhist does not accept the mental state of pleasure for the sake of the body, the sense-organs or the object. If one accepts that (then) it would contradict what is accepted (in the world[^697]).(And) pleasure (experience) and liberation is desired for the sake of vijñāna (knowledge) alone. Therefore[^698]that puruṣa alone which is different from the body, senses and the objects different from vijñāna, whose purpose is served by experience andliberation is to be accepted.

[^697]: "Even the Buddhist does not subscribe to this view."

[^698]: "Since the acceptance of vijñāna does not make sense and will have the contradictions already mentioned."

[^876]: # "This dismisses the Cārvākas (Lokāyatas

 Question—In case “yatkiñcit. vaināśikaḥ”= the Buddhist due to confusion, thinking that combinations like houses, etc., serve the purpose of (other) combinations like Devadatta, etc[^699]., and (so) does not accept a special another[^700], if he thinks so, then the answer is—he[^701]should be asked thus. That different puruṣa who is the same class as the body, sense-organs, objects and thoughts[^702]is he all that (all of them) or is he one amongst them or is he someone who is different (belonging to a differentclass) from all of them?

[^699]: "Human beings are also a combination of so many factors coming together according to the pūrvapakṣin."

[^700]: "A special puruṣa other than the combination."

[^701]: "The Buddhist."

[^702]: "In other words who is insentient like all these."

 It cannot be of the same class. The Buddhist does not accept a substance of the same class whose end is served by experience and knowledge (liberation) as it is in contradiction to their rules (philosophy). Nor does he desire the collection of body, etc[^703]., to be the ends served by experience and knowledge (liberation), as he[^704]desires experience and knowledge to serve only the stream of consciousness (vijñāna).

[^703]: "Body, sense-organs and objects."

[^704]: "The Buddhist Vijñānavādin is still under discussion."

Nor is there a (single) substance as “stream of consciousness”(as the stream is characterised by momentariness). Nor does it serve the end of experience and liberation of the stream (of consciousness) as it is not an entity (a substance) and is like rabbit's horn[^705].”Nor does he (Buddhist) accept any one of them[^706] (as served by experience and liberation) since these being different from consciousness at the time of belonging to oneself, the end served by experience and liberation will not stand scrutiny[^707].

[^705]: "It is an empty concept not having validity."

[^706]: "Either the body, sense-organs or object."

[^707]: "Will the end serve the body, sense-organs or object? Moreover none of these is seen to be associated with cognition and experience and liberation is rooted in consciousness. Thus they cannot satisfy the criterion."

 नापि शरीरेन्द्रियाणां सङ्घातो नाम वस्तुतो भवतो विद्यते, येन चित्तं संहतपरार्थं प्रार्थयेथाः। अवस्तुनो हि कथमर्थित्वम्। नापि शरीरेन्द्रियादिभ्योऽन्यं संहतभिन्नजातीयं प्रतिजानीषे। यदि भिन्नजातीयं भोगापवर्गाभ्यामर्थवन्तमदृष्टं परिकल्पयेथाः, स एवास्माभिरुक्तः पर इति। तस्य च संहतत्वे परत्वं दृष्टानात्मवन्नोपकल्पते। परिशेषात्तु असंहतो भोगापवर्गाभ्यामर्थी पर इति॥

 किं चान्यत्—संहतपरार्थं चित्तमिति साधयतोऽर्थिनः संहतस्यान्यस्यानुपपत्तेः स्वार्थमेव चित्तमित्युक्तं भवति। तथा च सति भवतो दृष्टान्ताभावोऽभ्युपगमविरोधश्च। तथा मन्वानस्यान्यद्वाचि हृदये चान्यदनिशम्यकारित्वं चापतति। येन चक्षुरादिपरार्थत्वसाधनेन विरुद्धतादोषः प्रत्याख्यायि। तेषां विज्ञानपरार्थत्वमिति चेद्विज्ञानस्यापि संहतत्वात् परार्थत्वं प्रसाधितम्। अथ विज्ञानस्यापि क्षणिकत्वादसंहतत्वमिति चेत् न—तस्य व्यतिरिक्तदृश्यत्वात् धर्ममात्रानभ्युपगमाच्च क्षणिकत्वानभ्युपगमाच्चेत्येतदपि प्रत्यवोचाम॥

 Nor do you (the Buddhist) have in truth a collective (collection) of the body and sense-organs (as a substance) through which you can plead that the mind serves the end of a collection[^708]. How can there be a purpose for a non-substance? Nor do you admit of a collection other than the body, sense-organs, etc., belonging to a different class. If (then) you imagine some invisible different class of substance whose end is served by experience and liberation that is the same thing that is described by us as 'the other'. And if that is a collection, its serving the end of another will not stand to reason like the non-substance which we have seen. Thus in conclusion the other which is not a collection is the one whose end is served by experience and liberation.

[^708]: "Collection like a human being called Devadatta, etc."

 Moreover, those who want to establish that the mind serves the end of another which is itself a collection, realising that another collection whose end is served does not stand to reason, end up by saying that the mind serves its own purpose. And in that case you will have no example (to back up your theory) and it will also be in contradiction to reason (what is accepted). One who thinks like that will end up by doing something unheard of as he says one thing and in his heart believes in something else. Thus by acceptance of the serving of another's purpose by the eyes, etc., the defect of contradiction is denied.^(**2**)

 Question—If it is said that they have the purpose of vijñāna (consciousness) then the answer is—since consciousness is also a collection, the serving the purpose of another has been strengthened (advanced).

  Question—If it is said that consciousness also being momentary it cannot be a collection then the answer is—that it is not so; it is seen as separate, it cannot be accepted as just a dharma[^709]and of a momentary nature—this is our reply.

[^709]: " In the Buddhist sense, i.e., a thing-in-itself."

 तस्मादुच्यते—यत्किंचित् परसामान्यमात्रं स्वरूपेणोदाहरेद्वैनाशिकः स सर्वः संहत्यकारित्वात् परार्थ एव स्यात्। न देवदत्तादिसंहतार्थत्वम्। उभाभ्यामावाभ्यामनभ्युपगमात्। त्वमपि विज्ञानव्यतिरेकेण नान्यमभ्युपैषि। वयमपि पुरुषव्यतिरेकेण नान्यार्थत्वमभिवाञ्छामः। विज्ञानमात्रत्वं च नोपपद्यत इत्युक्तम्। अतो यस्त्वसौ परो विशेषः स न संहत्यकारी पुरुषः स्वार्थ इति सिद्धः। तस्मादस्ति भोक्ता तस्य स्वार्थस्य स्वेन दृश्येन परार्थेनयनिमित्तः संयोगः। तद्वियोगात् कैवल्यमुपकल्पते॥२४॥

 Therefore it is said “yatkiñcit. ” and so on[^710].

[^710]: "While the bhāṣya has “yattu kiṃcit”the Vivaraṇakāra has “yatkiṃcit”While available readingshave “tatsarvam. parārtham”the reading here is “sa sarvaḥ...parārthaḥ”"

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**2.**They use the example of the eyes, etc., serving another's purpose in order to get over the obvious defect of saying one thing while believing in (meaning) something else. Since there are two intended things here, i.e., what is said and what is meant, there is the obvious contradiction of what really is the content of the thought at that moment. Instead of answering that defect the Buddhist, according to the Vivaraṇakāra, just confuses the issue by appealing to the example of the eyes serving another. This is not the issue at all here and no attempt is made to answer the defect according to the Vivaraṇakāra.

 Devadatta, etc., cannot be the end served by the collection (of body, etc.), as both of us do not accept that. You also do not accept anything other than consciousness[^711]. We also do not desire anything other than puruṣa whose purpose is served (by the combination). It has also been shown that consciousness alone does not stand to reason. Therefore, “yastvasau ”and so on (puruṣa) serves its own end²that is estabiished. Therefore, there is an experiencer of that, which has as its purpose its own-self through the object seen by itself and which serves the purpose of another and forwhich contact is the cause[^712];and when there is separation from that (contact of puruṣaand sattva-intellect) kaivalya is the result.

[^711]: "As the ultimate, whose purpose is served by experience and liberation in the Buddhist's view."

[^712]: "The whole Yoga philosophy is condensed in this line."

**विशेषदर्शिन आत्मभावभावनानिवृत्तिः॥२५॥**

 For one who sees the distinction there is cessation of the thought of his own states-of-being.

 **यथा प्रावृषि तृणाङ्कुरस्योद्भेदेन तद्बीजसत्तानुमीयते, तथा मोक्षमार्गश्रवणेन यस्य रोमहर्षाश्रुपातौदृश्यते, तत्राप्यस्ति विशेषदर्शनबीजमपवर्गभागीयं कर्माभिनिर्वर्तितमित्यनुमीयते।**

 Just as in the rainy season one infers the existence of seeds of grass, seeing bladesof grass sprouting forth, so also one infers that the karma leading to liberation, whichis the cause for insight into difference between the intellect and self has been broughtto completion, when one sees the flow of tears and hair standing on end in him whohears of the path of liberation.

  ** तस्यात्मभावभावना स्वाभाविकी प्रवर्तते।**

** यस्याभावादिदमुक्तम्—स्वभावं मुक्त्वा दोषाद्येषां पूर्वपक्षे रुचिर्भवत्यरुचिश्च निर्णये भवति।तत्रात्मभावभावना—कोऽहमासं, कथमहमासं, किंस्विदिदं, कथंस्विदिदं, के भविष्यामः कथं वाभविष्याम इति। सा तु विशेषदर्शिनो निवर्तते। कुतः? चित्तस्यैवैष विचित्रः परिणामः,पुरुषस्त्वसत्यामविद्यायां शुद्धश्चित्तधर्मैरपरामृष्ट इति। ततोऽस्यात्मभावभावना कुशलस्य निवर्ततइति॥२५॥**

 The thought pertaining to his own states of being, which is natural comes to him.In the absence of that (good karma) he gives up the nature thus described: and dueto defects (like avidyā &c.) he has a liking for the opposing view and no liking for theascertainment of truth. In that case, the thought pertaining to his states of beingappears as 'Who was I?' 'How was I?' 'What is this?' 'How is this?' 'What shall webecome?' 'How shall we become?' But this thought ceases in the case of one whosees the distinction (between the intellect and puruṣa). Why is this so? Because thispeculiar mutation (change) belongs only to the mind. But in the absence of 'avidyā'

-----------------------------------------------------------------

**2.** This is a strange statement. All along puruṣa's end was discussed as being served by the mentalstates of experience and liberation and suddenly puruṣa is spoken of as having its own purpose. The lackof attention to detail on the part of the Vivaraṇakāra comes out clearly here. It is difficult to believe thatŚaṅkara would make a statement like that. What is intended is obviously to maintain that puruṣa issvatantra, independent. It is to be noted that the Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything more to what thebhāṣya has said in the context.

puruṣa is pure, untouched by the characteristics of the mind. For this reason, the thought pertaining to his states of being ceases in the case of a person who is wise (who is a vivekakhyātī).

 The reason for the contact between puruṣa and the (sattva) guṇa is mentioned as avidyā. And that vanishes in the case of *viśeṣadarśinaḥ* = one who intensely desires to realise the self. He describes the mark[^713]of its disappearance as*viśeṣadarśinaātmabhāvabhāvanānivṛttiḥ*. *viśeṣaḥ* is the special puruṣa distinguished from all classes of manifested and unmanifested things. And he who has the capacity to realise that special (puruṣa) after distinguishing it from all classes of manifested and unmanifested objects is a viśeṣadarsī. In the case of such a one his *ātmabhāvabhāvanā*[^714]ceases to exist. It is directed towards discriminate-discernment (right insight) and is the cause for the rise of liberation (kaivalya, isolation).

[^713]: "The distinguishing mark of such a person is described in the sūtra."

[^714]: "Though this is an important word the Vivaraṇakāra does not explain it at all."

 Question—How does one know that a person has (achieved) *ātmabhāvabhāvanā*? The answer is given through the following words—“yathā prāvṛṣi”and so on^(**3**).(It is inferred) by the mark (sign) of hair standing on end and flow of tears[^715].
tasya = of the viśeṣadarśī, “ātmabhāvabhāvanā[^716]”caused by the karma leading to liberation (kaivalya), “svābhāvikī”, i.e., caused by karma[^717]over many lives or due to

[^715]: "The Vivaraṇakāra just repeats the bhāṣya verbatim without adding anything new."

[^716]: "The word is itself not explained but its cause is given."

[^717]: "As it is difficult to achieve this state through good karma in one life alone. But 'aparigraha' practised to perfection can achieve this result in this life itself as the next alternative shows."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**3.** The bhāsya has "tṛṇāṅkurasyodbhedena. " whereas theVivaraṇakāra has " tṛṇasyāṅkurasyodbhedena. " Again "tadbījasattā" is given as "tatbījasadbhāvo". He also has in brackets (gamyate) in place of anumīyate.

reaching steadiness (perfection) in non-acceptance-of-things^(**1**),in this life itself. And that “svābhāvikī pravartate”(comes naturally) without depending on the instruction of the preceptor[^718].“tasya[^719]”,i.e. (in the absence) of that kind of karma[^720], due to connection with impure karma[^721] (he has a liking for) the opposite of discriminate-discernment and the means leading to it (viveka) and (lack of desire for) discriminate-discernment (ascertainment of truth).

[^718]: "It is interesting to note that karma or yoga can independently lead to this state. The Vivaraṇakāra does not quote the bhāṣya as it is but adds explanatory words along with it."

[^719]: "The bhāṣya reading available has “yasya”instead of “tasya” and “svabhāvam muktvā doṣādyeṣām”instead of “svabhāvadoṣādeṣām”"

[^720]: "That kind of karma which leads to liberation."

[^721]: "Karma which gives rise to vipāka by being connected with the afflictions and thus it is impure."

 In answer to the question as to what is this “tasya ātmabhāvanā”he says “ko'hamāsam”and so on[^722]. “sā tu. .nivartate” =there is cessation of the strong desire to know that regarding which there was this strong desire, the moment that object (goal) is attained. “kutaḥ”= (why) is this so? Because “cittasya. ”= (this peculiar mutation like what shall we become, etc., belongs only to the mind) and not to puruṣa. “puruṣa ”and so on = because it is so, therefore the thought (pertaining to his states of being, ceases) in this way in the case of the person with insight. “tasya[^723]”.

[^722]: "The bhāṣya has “katham vā bhaviṣyāmaḥ”whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “katham bhaviṣyāmaḥ”"

[^723]: "The reading available is “tato'syātma. ."

**तदा विवेकनिम्नं कैवल्यप्राग्भारं चित्तम्॥२६॥**

 Then the mind inclined towards discriminate-discernment (insight) tilts heavily towards liberation.

 **तदानीं यदस्य चित्तं अज्ञानप्राग्भारम् विषयनिम्नमासीत्, तदस्यान्यथा भवति कैवल्यप्राग्भारं विवेकनिम्नमिति॥२६॥**

 Then that mind of his which was tilted heavily towards ignorance, (and) inclined towards (sensual objects) that becomes changed: it becomes tilted heavily towards liberation, (and) inclined towards knowledge born of discriminate-discernment.

 यदा च विशेषदर्शनमुदपादि, तदा विवेकनिम्नं कैवल्यप्राग्भारं चित्तम्। यदस्य चित्तं विषयनिम्नं विषयप्रवणम् अज्ञानप्राग्भारम् अज्ञाननिष्ठं संसाराभिभुखम् आसीत्, तदस्य विशेषदर्शिनः तदानीमन्यथा भवति, कैवल्यप्राग्भारं विवेकनिम्नम् इति प्रतिस्रोतोवृत्तिर्ज्ञायते॥२६॥

 When special insight (true insight) has arisen *tadā vivekanimnam kaivalyaprāgbhāram* *cittam* (then the mind tilts heavily towards discriminate-discernment). “yadasya[^877]”and so on, i.e. (that mind) which was inclined towards sensual pleasures, based on ignorance, leaning towards the world (repeated births and deaths)

[^877]: # "Available readings have “viṣayaprāgbhāram”instead of “ajñānaprāgbhāram” and “ajñānanimnam“ instead of “viṣayanimnam“ which the Vivaraṇa has."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1.** Acceptance of gifts is considered one of the vices and therefore aparigraha is mentioned as one of the yamas. It is non-avariciousness and most other defects can be avoided by practising this yama to perfection. The Vivaraṇakāra by singling out this yama, has given it pride of place amongst other virtues. Does it also tell us something of the social conditions of the time is a moot question. Cf.YS, II.30.

“tadasya”and so on, i.e., becomes, in the case of one with special insight, (tilted owards liberation); thus its flow in the opposite direction is understood.**¹**

**तच्छिद्रेषु प्रत्ययान्तराणि संस्कारेभ्यः॥२७॥**

 During the breaks (intervals) arise other thoughts due to latent (subliminal) impressions.

** प्रत्ययविवेकनिम्नस्य सत्त्वपुरुषान्यताख्यातिमात्रप्रवाहिणश्चित्तस्य तच्छिद्रेषु प्रत्ययान्तराण्यस्मीति वा जानामीति वा न जानामीति वा। कुतः? क्षीयमाणबीजेभ्यः पूर्वसंस्कारेभ्य इति॥२७॥**

 The mind which is inclined towards discriminate-discernment, ascending the flow of knowing the difference between the sattva intellect and puruṣa, has, during (its) breaks, other thoughts like 'I am' or 'This is mine' or 'I know' or 'I do not know', from what source (does this come)? From the earlier subliminal-impressions whose seeds are dwindling away.  
तच्छिद्रेषु प्रत्ययान्तराणि संस्कारेभ्यः। विवेकनिम्नस्य उत्तरोत्तरविवेकप्रवणचेतसः पुरुषस्य ज्ञानिनः अन्यताख्यातिप्रवाहाधिरोहिणः सत्त्वपुरुषान्यतास्रोतः प्लाविनः चित्तस्य तच्छिद्रेषु विवेकप्रत्ययप्रवाहान्तरालेषु प्रत्ययान्तराणि विपर्ययलक्षणानि अस्मीति वा ममेति वा। कुतः तानि भवन्तीत्याह—क्षीयमाणक्लेशादिबीजस्यचित्तस्य पूर्वोपचितविपरीतसंस्कारेभ्यः प्रत्ययान्तराणि जायन्ते॥२७॥

*tacchidreṣu pratyayāntarāṇi saṃskārebhyaḥ. “vivekanimnasya[^724]”*, i.e., in the case of that puruṣa[^725].")who has insight, i.e., one whose mind climbs progressively towards discriminate-discernment “anyatākhyāti[^726]. ”and so on, i.e. (in the case of that mind) which is flowing rapidly towards discriminate-discernment[^727]“tacchidreṣu ”and so on, i.e., when there are breaks in the flow of the thought of insight[^728]. “Pratyayāntarāṇi[^729]” (there are other thoughts) in the form of distractions like (I am, or this is mine, etc.).

[^725]: "Puruṣa is here being used in the sense of the knowing one (wise one, one with insight

[^728]: "When one-pointed thought is broken."

[^729]: "In the place of “jānāmīti vā na jānāmīti vā” found in available readings the Vivaraṇakāra has only “mameti vā''"

 In answer to the question “kutaḥ”, i.e., as to how these come into being he says “kṣīyamāṇa[^730]. ''and so on. In the case of the mind (whose seeds of afflictions are dwindling away) “pūrvopasaṃskārebhyaḥ[^731]”= other thoughts arise from the opposite subliminal-impressions which have been collected earlier (and which have not been totally extinguished, removed).

[^730]: "Again the Vivaraṇakāra has “kṣīyamāṇabījasya” instead of “kṣiyamāṇabījebhyaḥ” found in available texts."

[^731]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not quote the bhāṣya as it is but adds explanatory words along with it."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1.**Since there is no direct proof that one has attained special insight it can only be inferred through the behaviour of the person concerned. Thus when the mind, inclined towards worldly pleasures, becomes titled heavily towards thoughts pertaining to liberation one knows that the person has gained special insight.

**हानमेषां क्लेशवदुक्तम्॥२८॥**

 The removal of these (latent-impressions) is described as being like (the removal of) the afflictions.

**यथा क्लेशा दग्धबीजभावा न प्ररोहसमर्था भवन्ति, तथा ज्ञानाग्निना दग्धबीजभावः पूर्वसंस्कारो न प्रत्ययप्रसूर्भवति। ज्ञानसंस्कारास्तु चित्ताधिकारसमाप्तिमनुशेरत इति न चिन्त्यन्ते॥२८॥**

 Just as the afflictions, when in the 'burnt-seed-stage' are not capable of sprouting (again) similarly, the earlier subliminal-impressions which are in a burnt-seed-stage, through the fire of knowledge (insight), do not give birth to (any) thought.

 Whereas the subliminal-impressions of knowledge (insight) continue to exist till the task of the mind is completed; they are, therefore, not considered here.

  हानमेषां क्लेशवदुक्तम्। यथा क्लेशा दग्धबीजभावा न प्ररोहसमर्था भवन्ति इति 'ते प्रतिप्रसवहेयाः सूक्ष्माः' इत्यत्रोक्तम्, एवं ज्ञानाग्निदग्धबीजभावाः अस्मि ममेत्यादिप्रत्ययसंस्कारा न प्ररोहसमर्था भवन्ति। दग्धशालिबीजवत् पूर्वसंस्कारो न प्रत्ययप्रसूर्भवतीत्यर्थः॥

* hānameṣām kleśavaduktam*. “yathā kleśā...”(Just as the afflictions in a burnt-seed-stage are not fit for sprouting) which is mentioned in the sūtra *te pratiprasavaheyāḥsūkṣmāḥ[^878]*,“*evam*[^732]. ”= so also latent (subliminal) impressions like “I am”, “This is mine”, etc., are not fit to sprout again. Like rice grain (paddy) which is burnt (the earlier latent-impressions do not give rise to any thought).

[^732]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has “evam”in place of “tathā”and “jñānāgnidagdhabījabhāvaḥ”in place of “jñānāgninā dagdhabījabhāvaḥ”"

[^878]: # "YS, II.10."

 Question—Answering the question as to how the subliminal-impressions of knowledge (insight) while staying without opposition (in the mind), do not engage the mind in its task (of being bound[^733])he says—answer—that they “samyag śerate[^734]”(the saṃskāras of insight) get absorbed along with the supporting mind which has no more task to accomplish (completed its task ). They (the saṃskāras) do not allow the mind to again (come under the) flow of the mind's activity (of binding the self). This is so because insight is the opposer (obstructor) of avidyā (ignorance) which is the cause for the activity (of the mind). As they do not give rise to any result (of binding the mind) “na cintyante”(they are not considered here). In the case of something which is itself being destroyed there is no need of enquiring into the cause for the destruction.

[^733]: "All saṃskāras by their nature bind the mind to the world of births and deaths. But not so the saṃskāras of knowledge which only guide the mind to its spiritual fulfilment."

[^734]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has instead of “jñānasaṃskārāstu cittādhikārasamāptimanuśerata” “samyagdarśanasaṃskārāścittādhikāraparisamāptimanuśerate“"

**प्रसंख्यानेऽप्यकुसीदस्य सर्वथा विवेकख्यातेर्धर्ममेघः समाधिः॥२९॥**

 In the case of him who has no interest left even in the highest state of 'elevation' (and) who has constantly discriminate-discernment, there arises the samādhi (oneness) known as 'dharma-megha' (cloud of virtue).

** यदायं ब्राह्मणः प्रसंख्यानेऽप्यकुसीदस्ततोऽपि न किञ्चित्प्रार्थयते। तत्रापि विरक्तस्य सर्वथा विवेकख्यातिरेव भवतीति संस्कारबीजक्षयान्नास्य प्रत्ययान्तराण्युत्पद्यन्ते। तदास्य धर्ममेघो नाम समाधिर्भवति॥२९॥**

 When this brāhmaṇa has no interest left even in 'elevation', i.e, does not desire anything even from that state, then, when he is detached even from that (state) there is discriminate-discernment at all times. Thus, due to the dwindling away of the seeds of subliminal-impressions, other thoughts do not arise. Then he attains the ‘samādhi’ known as 'dharmamegha' (cloud of virtue).

 विवेकख्यातिप्रवणान्तःकरणस्य ब्राह्मणस्य प्रसंख्यानेऽप्यकुसीदस्य सर्वथाविवेकख्यातेर्धर्ममेघः समाधिः। स यदा अयं ब्राह्मणः प्रसंख्याने विवेकदर्शनशीलितेऽप्यकुसीदः अवृद्धिको भवति, ततोऽपि प्रसंख्यानप्रसादविशेषादधिकं न किंचित् प्रार्थयते। अपिशब्दात् प्रसंख्यानेऽपि न प्रार्थना। तत्रापि प्रसंख्याने विरक्तः। सर्वथा सर्वेण प्रकारेण विवेकख्यातिर्यस्य स सर्वथाविवेकख्यातिरेव भवति॥

 क्लेशसंस्कारबीजक्षयात् नास्य शरीरादौ शून्यवेश्मनीव अस्मि ममेति वा ज्ञानप्रसादमात्रैकायतनस्य प्रत्ययान्तराण्युत्पद्यन्ते। तदाऽस्य ब्राह्मणस्य सर्वथाविवेकख्यातेः धर्ममेघो नाम समाधिर्भवति। कैवल्याख्यं परं धर्मं वर्षतीति धर्ममेघः इति संज्ञा॥२९॥

 In the case of the brāhmaṇa (wise man) whose mind is inclined towards discriminate-discernment *prasaṃkhyāne'pyakusīdasya sarvathāvivekakhyāterdharmameghaḥ samādhiḥ*(there arises samādhi known as dharma-megha).

 “yadā ayam .akusīdaḥ”, i.e., when (that brāhmaṇa) who has trained (his mind) towards discerning insight does not grow (any further in that) “tato'pi prārthayate = (he does not desire) anything more than the special clarity of “prasaṃkhyāna” The use of the word “api”is to indicate that there is no desire even towards prasaṃkhyāna. “tatrāpi” = with regard to prasaṃkhyāna (also) “viraktaḥ[^735]”(he is detached). “sarvathā” = in all (conceivable) ways, (at all times) he who is possessed of discriminate-discernment is “sarvathāvivekakhyātireva bhavati”

[^735]: "The reading available is “viraktasya” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “viraktaḥ”"

 “saṃskāra utpadyante”= (due to the dwindling away of the seeds of latent-impressions) of the afflictions, he who is the abode just of clarity of insight (has no other thoughts)pertaining to the body like 'I am' or 'This is mine' as with an empty house.

 “tada'sya bhavati[^879]”.“asya”= in the case of (such a) brāhmaṇa (wise one). The technical name “dharmamegha”is so called because it rains the highest dharma called kaivalya (liberation, isolation.)

[^879]: # "The Vivaraṇakāra adds “sarvathāvivekakhyāteḥ” as an adjective to “asya”No attempt is made to give the meaning of this sentence; the bhāṣya has been repeated verbatim."

**ततः क्लेशकर्मनिवृत्तिः॥३०॥**

 Then follows the cessation of afflictions and of deeds (karma).

** तल्लाभादविद्यादयः क्लेशाः समूलकाषं कषिता भवन्ति। कुशलाकुशलाश्च कर्माशयाः समूलघातं हता भवन्ति। क्लेशकर्मनिवृत्तौ जीवन्नेव विद्वान्विमुक्तो भवति। कस्मात्? यस्माद्विपर्ययो भवस्य कारणम्। न हि क्षीणविपर्ययः कश्चित्केनचित्क्वचिज्जातो दृश्यत इति॥३०॥**

 By the attainment of that (dharmamegha), afflictions such as 'avidyā' (undifferentiated consciousness) &c., are destroyed up to the very root. And the latent deposit of deeds both good and bad are destroyed up to the very roots. When the afflictions and deeds cease (to be operative) the wise man, even though alive, is liberated. How is this so? Because lack of discrimination is the cause for existence (saṃsāra); no one has ever seen birth of one who is free from lack of discrimination, anywhere.

ततः क्लेशकर्मनिवृत्तिः। तस्य धर्ममेघनाम्नः समाधेः सम्यग्दर्शनपाकाभिरूपस्य (लाभात्) भावात् अविद्यादयः क्लेशाः समूलकाषं कषिताः वासनाभिः सह समस्ताः प्रलीनाः भवन्ति। कुशलाकुशलाश्च कर्माशयाः समूलघातं हता भवन्ति। मूलैः केशैः सहोच्छिना भवन्ति॥

 क्लेशकर्मनिवृत्तौ जीवन्नेव विद्वान् मुक्तो भवति। कस्मात् एवम्? यतो विपर्ययः मिथ्याज्ञानं भवस्य जन्मनः कारणम्। न हि क्षीणविपर्ययः कश्चित् क्वचिज्जातो दृश्यते॥३०॥

* tataḥkleśakarmanivṛttiḥ.* “tasya[^736]”, i.e, by attaining the samādhi known as dharmamegha which is the same as the fulfilment (height) of correct insight, “avidyā. bhavanti”= all the (afflictions like avidyā, etc.) get absorbed along with the latent impressions. “kuśalā bhavanti”= they get uprooted along with the basic (primary) afflictions.  
 “kleśa bhavati”.²“kasmāt”, i.e., how is this so? Because “viparyayaḥ”= incorrect knowledge is the cause for “bhavasya”= birth. “na hi[^737].”

[^736]: "“tasya”does not occur in the available bhāṣya. The Vivaraṇakāra is analysing the compound’ “tallābhāt” and giving the meaning here."

[^737]: "The Vivaraṇakāra leaves out the words “kenacit”. He does not add a single word by way of explaining the line."

**तदा सर्वावरणमलापेतस्य ज्ञानस्यानन्त्याज्ज्ञेयमल्पम्॥३१॥**

 At that stage, due to the endlessness of knowledge from which all obscuring dirt has been removed, that which is to be known is little.

**सर्वैः क्लेशकर्मावरणैर्विमुक्तस्य ज्ञानस्यानन्त्यं भवति। आवरकेण तमसाभिभूतमावृतमनन्तं ज्ञानसत्त्वं क्वचिदेव रजसा प्रवर्तितमुद्घाटितं ग्रहणसमर्थं भवति। तत्र यदा सर्वैरावरणमलैरपगतं भवति तदा भवत्यस्यानन्त्यम्। ज्ञानस्यानन्त्याज्ज्ञेयमल्पं संपद्यते; यथाऽऽकाशे खद्योतः। यत्रेदं उक्तम्—**

**अन्धो मणिमविध्यत्तमनङ्गुलिरावयत्।  
अग्रीवस्तं प्रत्यमुञ्चत्तमजिह्वोऽभ्यपूजयत्॥इति॥३१॥**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

**2.** While the bhāṣya has “vimukto bhavati”the Vivaraṇakāra has “mukto bhavati”. Moreover here is an opportunity for the commentator to expand on the concept of jivanmukta. While Śankara in his*Brahmasūtrabhāṣya* expands on the concept it is strange to believe that if he was the author of the Vivaraṇa he would have let go this opportunity to expand on the theme.

 Knowledge when freed from all coverings (impurities) like the afflictions and deeds is infinite. The infinite sattva-knowledge obscured (and) overcome by tamas which covers it, is only sometimes activated (and) set in motion by rajas when it becomes capable of knowing (grasping an object). In that case when all the obscuring impurities are removed then it becomes infinite. By the endlessness of knowledge what is to be known becomes little like a glow worm (firefly) in the sky. Regarding which this has been said 'A blind man pierced a jewel, one without fingers strung it on a thread; one without a neck put in on; one without a tongue praised it'

 तदा सर्वावरणमलापेतस्य ज्ञानस्याऽऽनन्त्यात् ज्ञेयमल्पम्। तदा धर्ममेघसमाधिसमये, सर्वैः क्लेशकर्मावरणैः रजस्तमोजन्मभिः विमुक्तस्य, ज्ञानस्य सत्त्वपुरुषान्यताख्यातिमात्रस्य भवत्यानन्त्यम्। तत् कथमिति? तमसा(न)ऽभिभूतमनन्तं ज्ञानसत्त्वं, तस्य तिरस्कृतरजोमलस्यानन्तस्य निस्तरङ्गमहोदधिदेशीयस्य निरहितस्याविक्रियस्य कथं तद्ग्रहणसामर्थ्यमित्याह—क्वचिद्रजसा प्रवर्तितं चित्तसत्त्वम् उद्घटितं वायुनेव महापयोदमण्डलमाहतं सूचितं ग्रहणसमर्थं भवति। स्वतः सत्त्वस्याप्रवर्तनात् रजसो हि प्रवृत्तिसामर्थ्यमिति॥

 तदाऽस्य चित्तस्य भवत्यानन्त्यम्, अशेषज्ञेयविषयत्वमम्बरतलमध्यवर्तिनो जलधरनिरोधनिर्गतस्य रवेरिव। तस्य ज्ञानस्यानन्त्यात् अशेषविषयत्वात् ज्ञेयमल्पं सम्पद्यते। यथा आकाशे खद्योतः इति। यथा आकाशापेक्षया खद्योतो न किंचिदेवमेतज्ज्ञानाभिसमीक्षया ज्ञेयं न किंचिदिति॥

*tadā sarvāvaraṇamalāpetasya jñānasyānantyāt jñeyamalpam. tadā* = at the time of dharmamegha samādhi. “sarvaiḥbhavati”= (freed from afflictions) which arise due to the qualities of rajas and tamas, knowledge which is only (now of the nature of) discriminate-discernment is infinite (in scope). How is that so? “tamasā . jñānasattvam”

 Question—How can that (knowledge) which has discarded the taint of rajas, which is endless (infinite), which is like a great ocean without any waves (with the waves quietened, which is calm) which is (therefore) devoid of any action, have the capacity to know that (the endless knowledge[^880]).

[^880]: # "Knowing is also an action and hence this question."

 Answer—“kvacit rajasā. . bhavati”= i.e., the sattva-mind (impelled and set in motion by rajas at times becomes capable of knowing); it is indicated like the impact of the wind on a huge collection of clouds[^738].As sattva-guṇa by its own nature does not act it is only the quality of rajas that has the capacity to act. “tadā . . ānantyam” Then (the mind) having as its object everything that is to be known[^739]is like the sun which is situated in the middle of the sky[^740], which has all obstruction in the form of clouds removed.

[^738]: "The impact of such a wind on the huge cloud mass would be negligible but will be known and can be felt. As sattva-intellect cannot by its own nature act it is rajas which acts even in the case of infinite knowledge."

[^739]: "The mind has all objects as its viṣaya, i.e., it is capable of knowing everything."

[^740]: "The mid-day sun is the brightest and hence the analogy with the mind which is bright now in its pristine glory."

 “jñānasya. khadyotaḥ” As knowledge has everything (all) as its object (what is still left to be known is little). Just as with respect to the sky the glow-worm is just nothing, so also with respect to (this) infinite knowledge that to be known is nothing[^741].

[^741]: "The stress is on the littleness of what is left to be known and not on absolutely nothing left."

परमार्थज्ञानावस्थायामशेषविपर्ययतिरोधाने सर्वपुरुषार्थशून्यता चेत्येतत्प्रदर्शनार्थमुदाहरणमाह—यत्रेदमुक्तम्—अन्धो मणिमविन्दत् (ध्यत्) तमनङ्गुलिरावयत्। अग्रीवः (तं) प्रत्यमुञ्चत् तमजिह्वोऽभ्यपूजयत्॥ इति। यथा

अन्धादीनां मणिवेधादिकमसम्भवदपि विपर्ययेणान्धो मणिमविध्यदिति व्यवह्रियते, तथा ज्ञानज्ञेयसंव्यवहारोऽपि विपर्ययावस्थायामेव। विपर्ययाभावे तु सर्वपुरुषार्थशून्या एव गुणाः सम्पद्यन्त इति॥३१॥

 In the state of knowledge (insight) of the highest truth, when the veil of ignorance is totally removed, there is an absence of any further goal for the puruṣa (to be achieved through the guṇas)-in order to indicate this he says “yatredam iti”

 Just as for the blind, tasks like piercing gems, etc., are not possible but due to ignorance (false knowledge) one says that a blind man pierced the gem, so also the usage (of categories) like knowledge and known is also only in the stage of ignorance. When ignorance is removed the guṇas become devoid of any purpose for the puruṣa (in question).**¹**

**ततः कृतार्थानां परिणामक्रमपरिसमाप्तिर्गुणानाम्॥३२॥**

 Thence the guṇas having completed (fulfilled) their purpose, there is an end their sequence (succession) of mutations.

 **तस्य धर्ममेघस्योदयात्कृतार्थानां गुणानां परिणामक्रमः परिसमाप्यते। न हि कृतभोगापवर्गाः परिसमाप्तक्रमाः क्षणमप्यवस्थातुमुत्सहन्ते॥३२॥**

 On the appearance of the cloud-of-virtue (dharmamegha) there is an end to the succession of mutations of the guṇas which have fulfilled their purpose. For (the guṇas) having achieved experience and liberation and having completed the sequence of mutations (in the form of effects) do not care to linger even for a moment.

ततः कृतार्थानां परिणामक्रमपरिसमाप्तिर्गुणानाम्। ततः धर्ममेघसमाधिसमुदयात् कृतार्थाश्चित्तगुणाः सम्पद्यन्ते। चित्ताधीनत्वाच्च कार्यकरणारम्भिणोऽपि सत्त्वादयः कृतार्था भवन्ति। समस्तस्य पुरुषार्थस्य कृतत्वात्। एषां कृतार्थानां गुणानां जन्ममरणप्र(भाव)वाहरूपःपरिणामक्रमः परिसमाप्यते। न हि कृतभोगापवर्गार्थाः क्षणमपि प्रयोजनाभावात् अवस्थातुमुत्सहन्ते॥३२॥

*  tataḥ krtārthānām pariṇāmakramaparisamāptirguṇānām. tataḥ* = when dharmamegha-samādhi has come into being the guṇas of the mind have fulfilled their purpose. As they are dependent on the mind, sattva, etc., though the (initiators) for bringing into being the effects, have fulfilled their purpose.**²**This is so because of fulfilling all the goals of puruṣa[^742] experiences and (final) liberation.").In the case (of the guṇas that have fulfilled their purpose)

[^742]: "The goals of puruṣa which the guṇas strive for are (various

--------------------------------------------------

**1.**This illustration has been explained differently by different commentators. Bhoja does not have this passage and probably did not consider it important enough to be included. For Vācaspati Miśra's and Hariharānanda Āraṇya's explanations, cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. IV, p. 126, n. 1. The Vivaraṇakāra takes it as a straightforward explanation of the state of ignorance. Miśra and Āraṇya tried hard to explain the verse because of its being a scriptural statement (Taitt. Āraṇ., 1.11.) while the Vivaraṇakāra does not show any knowledge of it. Since Bhikṣu also does not indicate its being a scriptural statement the explanation by the Vivaraṇakāra seems reasonable, as ignorance is under discussion.

**2.** Once the mind has reached the dharmamegha-samādhi state there is nothing more for the guṇas to achieve. The mind can be described in many ways here; firstly the mind is like everything else in SāṃkhyaYoga, composed of the three guṇas; therefore it is of the nature of the guṇas itself. While that is true the afflictions or karmāśaya are spoken of as located in the mind as a single unit. It is then that the mind is considered to set in motion the various effects and so in one sense we can understand that the guṇas,though instrumental for all effects, are dependent on the mind for their location in a certain sense.

 “krtārthānām. parisamāpyate” the flow in the form of (repeated) births and deaths (comes to an end). “na hi .. utsahante[^881]”, i.e., without any (further) purpose (to be achieved) (the guṇas do not care to linger on[^743]).

[^743]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything further to what the bhāṣya says."

[^881]: # "Available readings have “kṛtabhogāpavargāḥ”, while the Vivaraṇakāra has “kṛtabhogāpavargārthaḥ”"

 **अथ कोऽयं क्रमो नामेति ?**

 Now what is this called a sequence?

**क्षणप्रतियोगी परिणामापरान्तनिर्ग्राह्यः क्रमः॥३३॥**

 Sequence is the counterpart of the moment which is grasped as such at the extreme limit of mutation.

**क्षणानन्तर्यात्मा परिणामस्यापरान्तेनावसानेन गृह्यते क्रमः। न ह्यननुभूतक्रमक्षणा नवस्य पुराणता वस्त्रस्यान्ते भवति। नित्येषु च क्रमो दृष्टः।**

** द्वयी चेयं नित्यता—कूटस्थनित्यता परिणामिनित्यता च। तत्र कूटस्थनित्यता पुरुषस्य। परिणामिनित्यता गुणानाम्।**

 Sequence has as its essence an uninterrupted flow of moments and is known (grasped) at the conclusion of the limit of the mutation. The oldness of a cloth seen at the end does not come into being unless it has passed through the moments of a sequence. And one sees a sequence (even) in eternal (permanent) things.

 This permanence is of two kinds; one which is the permanence of the immutable and the (other, the) permanence of mutation. Of these the permanence of the immutable belongs to puruṣa; (and) the permanence of mutation belongs to the guṇas.

**यस्मिन्परिणम्यमाने तत्त्वं न विहन्यते तन्नित्यम्। उभयस्य च तत्त्वानभिघातान्नित्यत्वम्। तत्र गुणधर्मेषु बुद्ध्यादिषु परिणामापरान्तनिर्ग्राह्यः क्रमो लब्धपर्यवसानः, नित्येषु धर्मिषु गुणेष्वलब्धपर्यवसानः। कूटस्थनित्येषु मुक्तपुरुषेषु स्वरूपास्तिता क्रमेणैवानुभूयत इति तत्राप्यलब्धपर्यवसानः शब्दपृष्ठेनास्तिक्रियामुपादाय कल्पित इति।**

 That in which the essence is not destroyed while it is (itself) changing that is permanent. Both of these are permanent because their essential nature is not destroyed.

 In that context, to be known with reference to the characteristics of the guṇas (like) the intellect and so on, the sequence which is grasped at the extreme limit of mutation has an end; whereas with reference to the permanent substances, the guṇas, it (the sequence) has no end. With reference to the immutably permanent, the liberated puruṣas who are established in their own nature, the being in themselves is experienced as a sequence; therefore, even there it (the sequence) has no end. This (the sequence) has been imagined from the conception of the act of existence (being) based upon words.

 **अथास्य संसारस्य स्थित्या गत्या च गुणेषु वर्तमानस्यास्ति क्रमसमाप्तिर्न वेति? अवचनीयमेतत्। कथम्? अस्ति प्रश्न एकान्तवचनीयः—सर्वाेजातो मरिष्यति इति। ॐ भो इति।**

** अथ सर्वो मृत्वा जनिष्यत इति? विभज्य वचनीयमेतत्। प्रत्युदितख्यातिः क्षीणतृष्णः कुशलो न**

**जनिष्यत इतरस्तु जनिष्यते। तथा मनुष्यजातिः श्रेयसी न वा श्रेयसीत्येवं परिपृष्टे विभज्य वचनीयः प्रश्नः पशूनधिकृत्य श्रेयसी देवानृषींश्चाधिकृत्य नेति। अयं त्ववचनीयः प्रश्नः—संसारोऽयमन्तवानथानन्त इति। कुशलस्यास्ति संसारक्रमपरिसमाप्तिर्नेतरस्येत्यन्यतरावधारणे। दोषः। तस्माद्व्याकरणीय एवायं प्रश्न इति॥३३॥**

 Now is there or is there not an end to the sequence of births and deaths (saṃsāra) as it exists in the guṇas either in motion or in equilibrium? This is incapable of an answer. Why is that so? A question which can be answered is this—‘Will all that is born die': ‘Yes, Sir' There is on the other hand alternative answers for this question. 'Will everyone who is dead be born again?The wise man in whom discriminate-discernment has dawned (and) in whom desire has been destroyed will not be born again; whereas the others will be born again. Similarly, when asked the question 'Is mankind superior or not? It has to be answered after dividing it into parts. Thus 'It is superior to animals and not (superior) to gods and sages.But the following question is incapable of an answer 'Will this world (round of births and deaths) have an end or will it be endless?For the good there is cessation of the sequence of births and deaths; not for the others. If decided in favour of one or the other there will be defects. Therefore this question is fit to be analysed (into two parts).

 It is said *pariṇāmakramaparisamāptiḥ*[^744]**(there is cessation of the sequence of mutation). “atha ko'yam . . . nāma” (What is this sequence of the) guṇas whose end has been described. In order to understand that (sequence) it is thus said *kṣaṇapratiyogipariṇāmāparāntanirgrāhyaḥ kramaḥ*. As it joins the moments it is called *kṣaṇapratiyogī[^745].*

[^744]: "In YS, IV.2."

[^745]: "The technical explanation of pratiyogīas the counterpositive of something is absent here. It can thus point to a date before the age of Navyanyāya for the Vivaraṇa."

 “kṣaṇānantaryātmā”= the uninterruptedness of moments is the sequence of moments and its nature is its “ātmā”.It is the sequence of moments that has been explained in *kṣaṇatatkramayoḥ*[^746].

[^746]: "YS, III.52."

 Question—What is the mark (indication) of its being known.

 Answer—He says “pariṇāma... kramaḥ”^(**4**),i.e., through the mark in the form of the state of culmination (destruction, end) (that sequence is grasped).

---------------------------------------------

**4.** The readings available have"gṛhyate" instead of "nirgṛhyate" and "ananubhūtakramakṣaṇā" instead of "ananubhūtakramā" here. The Vivaraṇakāra also has "saḥkramaḥ" when there is no "saḥ" in the available readings.

 Question—How is there the knowledge through the end (conclusion)?

 Answer—“na hyananu . . . bhavati”, i.e. (without) supporting the sequence of one moment after another moment (a piece of cloth cannot be old at its time of destruction[^882]). One does not ever see a cloth that has just come into existence as being old (worn out). Therefore one infers the oldness through a mark that indicates it, i.e.. that by which this oldness (worn out condition) of a piece of cloth has been brought into being is the sequence.

[^882]: # "Since a piece of cloth at the time of coming into being is not seen to be destroyed and after a lapse of time it is thus seen, one has to infer its oldness through the sequence of time."

 If, in that context, there is both reaching-an-end and not-reaching-an-end (as the characteristics) of a sequence then it is proper to say kṛtārthānām . . guṇānām[^747].The reaching-an-end and not-reaching-an-end of a sequence fits in with what-is-eternal and what-is-not-eternal. Therein a sequence in the case of perishable objects like cloth, etc., is observed, but not of imperishable (eternal) things.

[^747]: "YS, IV.32."

 Question—In that case it will be illogical to speak of the end of the sequence of mutation in the case of the imperishable guṇas[^748].With this doubt (in mind) he says “nityeṣu..dṛṣṭaḥ”

[^748]: "The guṇas are nitya in the system as prakṛti is another name for the equilibrium or otherwise of the guṇas which are its constituents"

 Question—Is (that seen) in all cases (everywhere)?

 Answer—He says-not so. “dvividheyam... puruṣasya[^749]”.

[^749]: "The bhāṣya has only “dvayī ceyam”whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “dvividheyam”The Vivaraṇakāra does not also add any further explanation but just quotes the bhāṣya as it is."

Objection—How can there be permanence in the case of the guṇas which are subject to change (mutation)?

 Answer—He says-“yasmin. vihanyate”, i.e., that specific nature of something which is known through testimony (accepted means of knowledge), that is its specific essence. That (in which the essence) “na vihanyate”= is not destroyed (changed) that is also eternal (not perishable). In the case of the guṇas also the essence of illumi-

nation, activity, and inertia[^750]in the form of pleasure, pain, and illusion is not destroyed. Therefore these are also eternal while changing[^751].

[^750]: "The nature of sattva, rajas and tamas already are laid down by the system."

[^751]: "Different mutations take place but the guṇas themselves in their essence do not change."

 “ubhayatra nityatvam[^752]”.Therefore, since change is seen even in the guṇas which are imperishable, both reaching-an-end and not-reaching-an-end is established (prevalent, found).

[^752]: "The reading available is “ubhayasya”for “ubhayatra”and “tattvābhighātāt”for “tattvasyāvighātāt”"

 “tatra.. paryavasānaḥ[^753]”like in the case of bodies, etc. (in the case of the intellect, etc., the sequence has an end). "nityeṣu" because of their permanence (in the case of the gunas it has no end). “kūṭastha . vikalpita iti[^754]”, i.e., in the case of liberated puruṣas[^755]”it is experienced though not existent (in reality[^756]).(It is imagined as existent based upon words). In truth, as there is no mutation in puruṣas there is no sequence (with reference to puruṣas).

[^753]: "The reading available has “buddhyādiṣu“ in place of “mahadādiṣu”The Vivaraṇakāra just repeats’ what the bhāṣya says with an example."

[^754]: "The reading “kalpita”is available in place of “vikalpita”"

[^755]: "These are distinguished from the immutable Īśvara."

[^756]: "However there is no sequence in the case of the puruṣas as they are imperishable and eternal. But there is an experience of sequence between bondage and liberation though in truth it is not existent."

 अथास्य संसारस्य स्थित्या प्रधानरूपेण, गत्या विकारात्मना, द्वयं च गुणात्मकमिति गुणेषु च वर्तमानस्य अस्ति क्रमपरिसमाप्तिः न वेति? अवचनीयमेतत्। अस्त्येवेत्यवधारणं न शक्यं कर्तुम्। नापि नास्त्येवेति। किं तु विभज्य, कस्यचिदस्ति कस्यापि नास्तीति वचनीयमेव॥

 “athāsya. . na veti”, i.e., in the case of this world both in the form of pradhāna[^757]and in the form of change[^758]it is of the nature of the guṇas.

[^757]: "The underlying permanent entity."

[^758]: "There are two aspects of the world when we look at it in two ways. The permanent factor is pradhāna with the three guṇas and the perishable is the mutation of the guṇas."

  Question—(So is there an end to the sequence)?

 Answer—There is no (definite) answer to this. It is not possible to give a definite answer as 'There is an end to the sequence'; Nor, is it possible to say that “There is no

end (to the sequence)' But by dividing the question into parts it can be answered as in some cases there is an end (to the sequence) whereas in some (other) cases there is no end to the sequence.

  Question—Why is that so?

 Answer—Even without dividing the question (there can be alternate answers). Like for instance “sarvo. . mariṣyati”—will (all) those who are ignorant (of their true nature) die[^759]?

[^759]: "Thus it admits of alternate answers. Though even one who has insight also dies he understands that puruṣa does not die. But not so in the case of the ignorant one."

 Objection—Even one who has true knowledge also dies.

 Answer—One understands that death belongs only to the ignorant and not to the one who has insight. Thus it is said 'Falsely it is said by the ignorant that one dies[^760].'  
 Question—“atha sarvo . . . iti[^761]”.  
 Answer—As there is no single answer (to this) (it has to be answered by dividing it into two parts).  
 Question—In what way (is it divided and answered).  
 Answer—“pratyudita... janiṣyate[^762]”. “itaraḥ”= one who is ignorant. “manuṣya...praśnaḥ[^763]”(This question) has to be answered only by dividing it into parts.  
 Question—By dividing it in what way?  
 Answer—(In comparison to animals man is superior). (In comparison to gods and sages man is) not superior. “ayam ...praśnaḥ[^764]”.(The following question) cannot be answered without dividing it into parts like for instance “saṃsāro .. eveti vā[^765]”. As bondage and liberation are condradictory (to each other) it has to be answered by dividing it. Thus “kusalasya. .iti[^766]”.“anyatarā... doṣah[^767]”, i.e., there is the defect of logic if it is alternatively explained as either the world of births and deaths has an end or as the world of births and deaths has no end. “tasmāda.. praśnaḥ[^768]”. (Therefore this question cannot be analysed) generally without dividing it into parts, just as (the other questions already discussed like “sarvo.. ”and “manuṣyajātiḥ[^769]”).Therefore the adjective has been used appropriately in the sūtra *kṛtārthānām pariṇāmakrama .. guṇānām[^747].*

[^760]: "Not traced."

[^761]: "The Vivaraṇakāra just repeats the bhāṣya and answers it with hardly any new point added to the bhāṣya."

[^762]: "Only “itara”has been explained as the ignorant one, and the rest are left without any explanation."

[^763]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not quote the text as is available but adds “eva naiva vetyavacanīyaḥ”inplace of “na vā śreyasītyevam paripṛṣṭe vibhajya vacanīyaḥ”"

[^764]: "The Vivaraṇakāra adds an “eva”to the bhāṣya."

[^765]: "The Vivaraṇakāra quotes the bhāṣya as “antavāneveti ananta eveti vā“"

[^766]: "Available readings have “saṃsārakramasamāptiḥ”whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “saṃsāracakrasamāptiḥ”."

[^767]: "Available readings have “adoṣaḥ”which connects logically with the sentence. As the Vivaraṇakāraalso quotes it as a single sentence taking it as "

[^768]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has “avyākaraṇīyaḥ”instead of “vyākaraṇīyaḥ” as available in texts. Commentators like Miśra and Bhikṣu take it as “vyākaraṇīyaḥ”."

[^769]: "Already discussed earlier in the bhāṣya."

**  गुणाधिकारक्रमसमाप्तौ कैवल्यमुक्तम्। तत्स्वरूपमवधार्यते—**

 It is said that when there is cessation of the sequence of activity of the guṇas there is ‘isolation’(liberation). Its nature is now defined.

**पुरुषार्थशून्यानां गुणानां प्रतिप्रसवः कैवल्यं  
स्वरूपप्रतिष्ठा वा चितिशक्तिरिति॥३४॥**

**  इति श्रीमहर्षिपतञ्जलिविरचिते योगसूत्रे चतुर्थः कैवल्यपादः॥**

 Liberation (Isolation) is the inverse generation (latent state) of the guṇas which are devoid of any purpose (object, goal) of puruṣa; or it is the power of consciousness established in its own nature.

 Thus ends the fourth pāda called Kavivalya in the Yogasūtras composed by Maharṣi Patañjali.

 **कृतभोगापवर्गाणां पुरुषार्थशून्यानां यः प्रतिप्रसवः कार्यकारणात्मकानां गुणानां तत्कैवल्यम्, स्वरूपप्रतिष्ठा पुनर्बुद्धिसत्त्वानभिसम्बन्धात्पुरुषस्य चितिशक्तिरेव केवला, तस्याः सदा तथैवावस्थानं कैवल्यमिति॥३४॥**

 When the guṇas whose essence is causes and effects, have accomplished experience and liberation (for puruṣa) and are devoid of any goal for puruṣa (and are latent, that stage) is isolation. Again being established in its own nature is the power of consciousness alone of puruṣa unconnected with the 'sattva-intellect'. Its continuance in this stage forever is isolation (liberation).

 गुणाधिकारपरिसमाप्तौ कैवल्यमुक्तम्। तत्स्वरूपमवधार्यते। कैवल्यं प्रति विप्रतिपत्तेः। केषां चिद्विज्ञानसन्तानस्यात्यन्तोपशमः कैवल्यम्। केषांचित्तु नवानामात्मगुणानां बुद्धीच्छाद्वेषप्रयत्नसुखदुःखधर्माधर्मसंस्काराणामुच्छेदेनाचेतनस्य द्रव्यमात्रस्य पुरुषस्यावस्थानम्। केषांचिदीश्वरसायुज्यम्। केषांचित् सर्वज्ञत्वादीश्वरतुल्यधर्मत्वप्राप्तिः कैवल्यमिति भिन्ना मतिः॥

 “guṇādhikāra . . . dhāryate”^(**1**),i.e., with regard to the confusion (doubt) concerning liberation (kaivalya) (there are many opinions). For some it is absolute cessation of the flow of consciousness[^771].For some others, on the other hand, it is the cessation of the rise of new qualities of ātman like intelligence, desire, hatred, effort (volition) pleasure, pain, dharma (virtue), adharma (vice) and latent-impressions and the state of the unconscious puruṣa of the nature of pure substance[^772].In the case of yet some

[^771]: "Reference to the Vijñānavādin."

[^772]: "Reference to the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika position of apavarga."

------------------------------------------------------------

**1.**In the enunciation to the sūtra the reading available is “... . kramasamāptau" whereas the reading here is " . . parisamāptau"

others it is attaining oneness with Īśvara[^773]. For some others, because of omniscience, kaivalya is the attainment of a state similar to Īśvara[^774]—thus there are many views (regarding kaivalya).**³**

[^773]: "The dualists who believe in Īśvara have this as their goal."

[^774]: "This could refer to the Yoga view or Jaina view? In the Jaina view Īśvara will denote Tirthaṅkara."

 In this context as well, in order to remove confusion he defines the nature of kaivalya as *puruṣārthaśūnyānām guṇānām yaḥ pratiprasavaḥ*, i.e., contact in reverse, coming to rest in one's own (primary) cause, because of change into their essential nature of causes and effects[^775],“kārya . . . pariṇatānām”^(**5**)(that is kaivalyam) of puruṣa; it is staying alone (abiding alone) or it means a state where there is no connection with guṇas.

[^775]: "The potential of the guṇas to effect mutations means their various roles as instruments and effects. But in the state of kaivalya they retain their essence in the primary state."

 “svarūpapratiṣṭhā . . . kaivalyam”.**⁶** He defines kaivalya (with reference to puruṣa) as having no connection (with the guṇas) and abiding always in that state (of power of consciousness); thus it (kaivalya) is of the nature of aloneness.

 ननु कैवल्यस्यैकत्वे कथं विकल्पः? क्रियायां हि विकल्पो न तु वस्तुनि।वस्तुस्वरूपस्य भेदानुपपत्तेः। कैवल्यमपि वस्तु, कथं तद्विकल्प्यत इति। नैष दोषः। निमित्तनैमित्तिकयोः प्रभेदोपपत्तेः। निमित्तनैमित्तिकभेदोपचरितोऽपि विकल्पो न वस्तुस्वरूपभेदकृतः। या तु गुणानां परिणामिता पुरुषस्य विमिश्रता वृत्तिसरूपता, सा कार्यकरणात्मकानां पुरुषार्थशून्यानां गुणानां प्रतिसंसर्गान्निमित्तादपगच्छतीति निमित्तमेव प्रतिप्रसवाख्यं कैवल्यशब्देनोपचरितं पूर्वम्॥

 द्वितीयं तु गुणप्रतिप्रसवनिमित्तभावि यत् स्वरूपावस्थानं पुरुषस्य गुणैरमिश्रिततया, तत् कैवल्यमिति विशेषः। गुणपुरुषान्तरस्वरूपतत्त्वनिर्धारणेन तन्त्रान्तरीयतत्त्वस्वरूपनिराकरणेन च कैवल्यान्तराणि निवेदितव्यानि॥

 तत्रोङ्कारो मङ्गलार्थः प्रयुक्तः परमेश्वरनामाङ्कितमस्तकतया तन्त्रप्रचयार्थं शान्त्यर्थं वा वेदारण्यकवदिति ओम् इति॥

 Objection—If kaivalya is of the nature of oneness (aloneness) how can there be any thought (construction)? There is only thought (misunderstanding) with reference to action and not with reference to a substance, as it is not logical to understand differently the nature of a substance. Kaivalya is also a substance and so how is it possible to think differently about it?

 Answer—There is no defect here as it is possible to differentiate between the cause and its effects. Though (in this case) the difference between the cause and the effects is figurative[^883],the misunderstanding does not cause any difference in the nature of the substance. That connection or oneness of the puruṣa with the modifications of the

[^883]: # "In truth there is no difference but in the state of ignorance it is figuratively so understood."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**3.**If indeed Śankara was the author of the Vivaraṇa here was a splendid opportunity to discount other views and at least talk about Advaita. It is strange that there is no mention of advaita mokṣa here even though other schools including Buddhism (and Jainism) find a place in the discussion.

**5.**The Vivaraṇakāra has "kāryakaraṇātmakatyāpariṇatānām" instead of "kāryakaraṇātmakānām guṇānām".

**6.**The readings available have ". . . sattvānabhisaṃbandhāt. whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has sattvānabhisaṃbandhinī...". Again the passage ends with “kaivalyamiti" but in the reading of the Vivaraṇakāra the bhāṣya ends with "Omiti". Moreover, when the Vivaraṇakāra quotes the text in the Vivaraṇa he adds a “vā” after “svarūpapratiṣṭhā” which is not there. He also adds “yā” after “buddhisattvānabhisaṃbandhinī" which is again not there in available bhāṣya readings.

mind which is the mutation of the guṇas now have become a reversal[^776]of the (nature of the) guṇas whose essence is causes and effects (and which have now) become devoid of any goal to be achieved for puruṣa; it (the purpose) therefore has disappeared from the cause; therefore (one could say that) the cause itself, known as dissolution, is figuratively called by the word kaivalya in the first place[^777].

[^776]: "In the state of kaivalya the guṇas no more go through any mutation for the sake of puruṣa."

[^777]: "The importance is to the reversal of the nature of the guṇas and only figuratively applied to puruṣa's kaivalya in the first option. Kaivalya primarily denotes the guṇas going back to its original nature, and secondarily to puruṣa's isolation from bondage."

 The second definition is of puruṣa abiding in its true state (nature) without being connected with the guṇas brought about by the reason of the guṇas going back to their original cause—that special state is kaivalya. Due to ascertaining the true essence of the difference between the guṇas and puruṣa and also with the purpose of rejecting the nature of the (ultimate) essence given in other systems, the definition of kaivalya given in other schools has been described.

 In that context 'Om' has been used to denote auspiciousness. With the forehead marked by the name of Parameśvara, with the aim of gaining knowledge or for the sake of peace 'Om' (is used symbolically) like in the Āraṇyakas of the Veda[^778].  

[^778]: "Om as a symbol denoting Brahman or the ultimate principle came into wide use only by the time of the Upaniṣads. Therefore the stress here is on the symbolic nature of Om and not on its usage as such in the Vedas and Āraṇyakas."

  Verses.

 He whose denoter is Om, because of whom all-karma along with the results is properly connected with the fruits, he who is free from the result of affliction, being

devoid of action, connects all action with their results, he who is the god of all gods, who is the creator of such activities as the maintenance, creation and destruction (of the universe), may that Kṛṣṇa remove white (karma) (and) completely remove black (karma) of us who are meditating (on him).

 He who traversed the three worlds (in the Vāmana incarnation), whose unthinkable partial powers in the form of incarnations like the fish, etc., are spoken of as ten, to him who sleeps on the bed of the king of serpents, we who are suffering from the family of the threefold pain arising from afflictions, we approach for refuge.

 The earth shines by the splendour of the cluster of gems on his head; To him who is the atmosphere, sky and all directions we bow down; (we bow down) to that Patañjali the lord of yogīs and the lord of serpents[^779].

[^779]: "The reference here is to Patañjali being the incarnation of Śeṣanāga."

 He who purified the mind through yoga, purified language through inflected words and purified the body through medicine, to that Patañjali, the greatest of seers, I bow down with folded hands.

 That sage Patañjali reigns supreme, by whom benefit from (medicinal) plants which serve a purpose has been arranged, and by whom has been arranged the joy through dharmamegha, which gets rid of the threefold pain.

 I bow down to that sage Patañjali who has spread the cloud of Yoga, which has as its prominent feature dharmamegha for driving away the heat in the form of karma and afflictions, in the case of those who want to go beyond worldly existence.

 I bow down to that unequalled Śaṅkara Bhagavadpāda, the powerful guru who has the full moon as his face, who is not holding a serpent, (and) who does not have ashes as his decoration[^780].

[^780]: "It is not possible to believe that Śaṅkara would write such self-praise nor that he would agree to include such praise in his work."

** इति श्रीपातञ्जलयोगसूत्रभाष्ये श्रीमद्वेदव्यासकृते॥ चतुर्थः कैवल्यपादः॥**

 Thus ends the fourth pada called the Kaivalyapāda in the commentary of Vyāsa on*Yogasūtras* of Patañjali.

इति श्रीगोविन्दभगवत्पूज्यपादशिष्यस्य परमहंसपरिव्राजकाचार्यस्य श्रीशङ्करभगवतः कृतौ पातञ्जलयोगसूत्र(शास्त्र)भाष्यविवरणे चतुर्थः कैवल्यपादः॥॥ समाप्तं चेदं विवरणम्॥

 Thus ends the fourth chapter called the Kaivalyapādaḥ in the Vivaraṇa on the commentary on the Yogasūtras of Patañjali composed by Śrī Bhagavatpāda, Śaṅkara the paramahaṃsa-parivrājaka-ācārya who is disciple of Śrī Govindapāda.

 Thus ends this Vivaraṇa.

**The Problem of the Authorship of the Yogasūtrabhāṣyavivaraṇam**

 

This is not an exhaustive examination of whether 'Śaṅkarācārya' is or is not the author of the *Yogasūtrabhāṣyavivaraṇam*[^782] (YSBHV). But it is a caution to all those who are supporting the view that Śaṅkarācārya is the author of YSBHV. A strong consensus is gathering, particularly amongst scholars outside India, that the YSBHV is Śaṅkarācārya's work.**²** This consensus is gaining ground in spite of many points which cannot be wished away.

[^782]: "Everywhere in this paper, whenever the author of the Brahmasūtrabhāṣya is meant he is referred to asŚaṅkarācārya"

 Having just completed an annotated English translation of the Yogavārttika ofVijñānabhikṣu[^783], I have been drawn into examining this question of the authorship of the Vivaraṇam since it is a commentary on the *Yogasūtrabhāṣya*. I have thus embarked upon an annotated English translation of the YSBHV and have just completed the Samādhipāda. I have formed some opinions regarding the authorship of this work while translating the first pāda and am hopeful of discovering some more points which may or may not support my conclusions. However a detailed examination must wait till the translation of the entire work is completed. Meanwhile I shall deal briefly with some of the points which strike me as important in a discussion of this question.

[^783]: "T.S. Rukmani, Yogavārttika of Vijñānabhikṣu, 4 vols., Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, New Delhi, 1981-89."

  All the known works of Śaṅkarācārya are either original works or are commentaries on original works. The only exception to this is the bhāṣya on the *Māṇḍūkyopaniṣadkārikās* of Gauḍapāda. But as is well-known this is still a disputed attribution as scholars like Karmarkar do not consider this *bhāṣya* to be a work of Śaṅkarācārya[^784]. This cannot be ignored in such a discussion. The YSBHV being a commentary on a commentary does not fit into the known works of Śaṅkarācārya.

[^784]: "R.D. Karmarkar, Gauḍapāda Kārikā, BORI, Poona, 1953."

 Śaṅkarācārya also, as far as we know, did not even write commentaries on the sūtra texts of the other systems of Indian philosophy[^785]. The apparent reason for this could be that Śaṅkarācārya, being an uncompromising advaitin, could not reconcile himself to arguing the ontological standpoint of other systems which would mean making compromises in the advaitic view. A Vijñānabhikṣu could interpret the

[^785]: "We have no knowledge of any commentary ofŚaṅkarācārya on the Sānkhya, Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika or Pūrvamīmāmsā sūtras."

--------------------------------------------------------------

**2.**P. Hacker, H. Nakamura, S. Mayeda, T. Vetter, Sri Rāma Sastri, and Sri Krishnamurti Sastri the editors of YSBhV in the Madras Oriental Series and Trevor Leggett.

 When I started this translation of the YSBHV, I was not aware of Leggett's translation of the same. Halfway through the work I got to see his translation of the Samādhipāda and again noticed that he is also inclined to attribute it to Śaṅkarācārya.

*Brahmasūtras* in keeping with his yogic beliefs as an instance of a relationship ofBhedābheda[^786]between the jīvas and Īśvara; a Vācaspati Miśra could interpret objectively the various systems[^787]keeping their respective ontological standpoints intact, in spite of his own inclination towards advaita. Vācaspati Miśra was perhaps unique in this respect. But in Śaṅkarācārya's case his total commitment to advaita did not allow him any scope to comment on any other system apart from referring to many of them in the course of his writings on advaita[^788].

[^786]: "Vijñānāmṛtabhāṣyam."

[^787]: "Bhāmatī, Nyāyatātparyaṭīkā, Tattvakaumudī, Tattvavaiśāradī."

[^788]: "athāto brahmajijñāsā."

 The YSBHV begins with two nāndi verses. This is again not in keeping with the style and character of Śaṅkarācārya. He seems to be a man in a hurry and plunges straight into the interpretation of the text at hand. When the matter is of utmost importance he even writes two commentaries on the text as in the case of the *Kenopaniṣad*[^789]; and when he thinks that there is nothing significant to be said, he chooses to ignore portions of the text as in the case of the first chapter of the Bhagavadgītā.

[^789]: "pada and vākya."

 It is even more difficult to wish away the set of seven verses with which the YSBHV ends. These again do not fit into the character of Śaṅkarācārya. What makes it more difficult is that one of the verses is openly in praise of Śankarācārya himself[^790]. This verse has been glossed over by those wanting to believe in the authorship of Śaṅkarācārya by saying that the scribe just inserted it at the end in his enthusiasm. Another explanation given is that Śaṅkarācārya himself included it in the work at the request of his disciple. There is absolutely no justification for this kind of a roundabout explanation in order to retain the belief in Śaṅkara's authorship of the work. The accepted code in Sanskrit, that unless the *vācyārtha* is not in consonance with reason no *lakṣaṇārtha* should be resorted to, is equally applicable here as well. One has to accept the obvious conclusion that it is not the work of Śaṅkarācārya but of some other Śaṅkara, a great scholar no doubt, belonging to perhaps the Payyur family in Kerala. The fact that there has been so far only one known manuscript of the YSBHV which was obtained from Kerala, is also significant in this connection.

[^790]: "vadanāhitapūrṇacandrakaṁ gurumīśānamabhūtibhūṣaṇam praṇamāmyabhujangasangraham bhagavatpādam apūrvaśaṅkaram."

 Halbfass has mentioned the fact that already in 1931 a part of the Vivaraṇam was published as an appendix to Maṇḍana's *Sphoṭasiddhi* with Parameśvara's Gopālikācommentary[^791]. The editor of this work S.K. Ramanathan Śāstrī did not consider the YSBHV as Śaṅkarācārya's work but as the work of Śaṅkarabelonging to the scholarly Payyur family of Kerala in the fourteenth/fifteenth centuries. As the work existed in the fourteenth century the outside limit can at least be considered not to be later than the fourteenth century AD. The fact that Vācaspati Miśra and Madhusūdana Saraswatī, two great followers of Śaṅkarācārya, do not seem to be aware of the YSBHV also lends credence to the belief that the work is later and hence can be attributed to the fourteenth century.

[^791]: "Wilhelm Halbfass, Studies in Kumārila and Śaṅkara, Appendix, p. 107."

 There is a significant statement in the YSBHV under bhāṣya I.24 where the author

says that the word *nimitta* has been explained as proof (*pramāṇa*) by others[^792]. The editors themselves mention that it could be Vācaspati Miśra who is referred to here but they do not pursue it as that would jeopardise the theory of Śaṅkara's authorship of the work. But we do know that both Miśra[^793].")and Vijñānabhikṣu take the word*nimitta* to mean *pramāṇa*[^794].").This does indicate that the Vivaraṇakāra could be later than both Miśra and Bhikṣu. But the accepted date of Bhikṣu being the sixteenth century AD[^795]and the existence of the YSBHV already in the fourteenth AD as mentioned above, indicates that the Vivaraṇakāra is indeed referring to Miśra in his work.

[^792]: "anyeṣām vyākhyānam-nimittaśabdaḥ pramāṇavācī."

[^793]: "kiṃ sanimittaḥ sapramāṇakaḥ (TV

[^794]: "Sanimittakaḥ sapramāṇakaḥ—Yogavārttika (YV

[^795]: "Rukmani, Yogavārttika of Vijñānabhikṣu, vol. I, Introduction."

 There is also another important point to be considered for dating the YSBHV after Miśra and before Bhikṣu. While translating the *Yogavārttika* of Bhikṣu, I had come across a single reference to the Vivaraṇa in the Vibhūtipāda[^796]. At that time I did not realise its significance and thought that it was a reference to Padmapāda's Vivaraṇa. But it now seems extremely probable that Bhikṣu was indeed referring to this Vivaraṇam in support of his interpretation as against the interpretation of Miśra. Both the sources he is using are from the Yoga tradition and it is but appropriate to understand that the YSBHV is what is being referred to here. In effect he opposes Miśra's understanding of the words *prāṇādi* and *jīvana* and agrees with the interpretation of the YSBHV.⁶This an important statement as it shows that at least one of the wellknown commentators on Yoga was familiar with the YSBHV This also answers partially the question raised by Halbfass in his notes on the YSBHV about it not being acquainted with the *Tattvavaiśāradī* of Miśra or of the later commentators like Bhikṣu not knowing the existence of the YSBHV[^797].

[^796]: "Ibid., vol. III, p. 150, 150n."

[^797]: "Wilhelm Halbfass, op. cit., p. 108."

 These surmises may not be conclusive but they are as good as any of the arguments put forward in favour of the YSBHV being the work of Śaṅkarācārya. This has to be combined with the ‘un-Śaṅkarācārya' style in which the YSBHV is written. It is tedious, laboured and careless. The felicity and clarity of expression which are characteristic of Śaṅkarācārya are absent in this work. This combined with the fact that the Vivaraṇakāra is indeed advocating the ontological position of the Yoga system without any advaitic comments, may be the reason for Hacker's arguing for Śaṅkarācārya's earlier leaning towards Yoga and a later conversion to advaita. There is absolutely no evidence for this opinion; on the contrary traditionally Śaṅkara has only been an advaitin and even his interpretation of sūtras like BS, II.1.3. reinforces this tradition. It is surprising thus to note that a scholar of Hacker's eminence accepts the YSBHV as Śaṅkarācārya's work on the rather weak argumentation of the

colophon of the manuscript mentioning the author as Śaṅkarabhagavadpāda. Hacker set the trend and many more have followed in his footsteps without even attempting a detailed analysis of the work itself. Until that is done it is not correct to call the YSBHV a work of Śaṅkarācārya.

 It is also pertinent to note that very often the Vivaraṇakāra repeats the entire bhāṣya without adding even a single word as explanation of his own[^798].This must strike one as unusual for a man of such originality of thinking as Śaṅkarācārya. This combined with the fact that there is a paucity of śruti quotations in three out of four of the pādas[^799]does not make it easy to attribute the YSBHV to Śaṅkarācārya.

[^798]: "Cf. 1.21, 31, 32, 36, 41-43, 47, 49."

**Śaṅkara's Views on Yoga in the Brahmasūtrabhāṣya in the  
Light of the Authorship of the Yogasūtrabhāṣyavivaraṇa**

*Etena yogaḥ pratyuktaḥ[^801].*The commentary of Śaṅkara under this sūtra makes it clear that Śaṅkara is totally opposed to the yoga theory of prakṛti being the material cause of the universe. On the other hand, the importance that is given to yoga practices in his *Brahmasūtrabhāṣya* reveals that Śaṅkara is not against the methodology of yoga as long as it suits his purpose. This dual attitude of Śaṅkara towards yoga assumes significance in the light of the question of Śaṅkara's authorship of the *Yogasūtrabhāṣyavivaraṇa* (YSBHV). I had written a brief preliminary paper on this that appeared in this journal and would like to add a few more points as a sequel to that paper.

[^801]: "BS, II.1.3."

 In my earlier paper I pointed out that all the well-known works attributed to Śaṅkara are either original works or commentaries on original works, the only exception being the *Māṇḍūkyakārikābhāṣya*, the authorship of which is still in dispute. If this is to be judged an authentic work of Śaṅkara, then it must be admitted that it stands on a different footing altogether from the other works accepted as Śaṅkara's. For one thing it is a commentary on his guru's work[^802]and it is also not just a commentary but a significant work in its own right. The emphasis of the *Kārikābhāṣya* is on establishing the vivartavāda as against the ajātivāda, which finds prominence in Gauḍapāda's work.

[^802]: "The lineage being Gauḍapāda then Śaṅkarācārya."

 Śaṅkara as a commentator is on par with authors like Praśastapāda, Vātsyāyana, Śabara and Vyāsa. Each one of these great commentators has a distinctive voice. Each not only clarifies the intent of the respective Sūtrakāra but carries his commentaries beyond the mere texts, leaving them richer and elevating them to a higher philosophical plane. These commentators have taken upon themselves the pioneering work of interpreting their respective Sūtrakāra and appear to have a philosophical commitment to the school they are interpreting. Thus it would be futile to expect Vātsyāyana, Praśastapāda, Śabara or Śaṅkara to have commented on the sūtras of other schools. At best they look for corroboration of their own philosophical viewpoint in whatever work they study. This is an important point one should bear in mind while looking at the question of the authorship of the YSBHV.

 While dealing with philosophical schools, it is again of vital importance to consider which aspect of philosophy is being given more importance by a particular philosopher or even a particular commentator while interpreting the sūtras. For instance, while Gautama's *Nyāyasūtras* would like to emphasise the epistemological

viewpoint, it is the ontological standpoint which is given prominence in the*Vaiśeṣikasūtras*. If we look at Śaṅkara's commentary on the *Brahmasūtras* (BS) what stands out boldly is his ontological approach. For Śaṅkara Brahman is the one and only truth and the only being and all else is not-truth. Thus the ultimate is a single principle or vastu called Brahman and any system which advocates more than a single ultimate being cannot be true in the final analysis; of necessity it must be dealing with a lower level of being for Śaṅkara. To imagine that with these strong views Śaṅkara would yet write a commentary on a commentary of the *Yogasūtras* (YS), which is an out and out dualistic school, is not an easy matter.

  If we examine the BSBh closely we find that of the six systems of philosophy Śaṅkara accepts the methodology of Nyāya logic and makes use of its reasoning at quite a few places^(**1**).But Śaṅkara's acceptance of the methodology of Nyāya for his arguments cannot be extended to mean that he also supported its ontological stand. Since Śaṅkara refutes the Vaiśeṣika doctrine vehemently time and again[^803], it goes without saying that Śaṅkara opposes the philosophy of both Nyāya and Vaiséṣika as they do not lead to the ultimate goal of realisation of Brahman. Thus one can understand why Śaṅkara did not write a commentary on Gautama's *Nyāyasūtras* much less on Vātsyāyana's *Nyāyasūtrabhāṣya*.    

[^803]: "Cf. BSBh., I.1.5; II.1.11, 12, 29; 2.11 et seq."

  When one looks at the position that Yoga occupies in Śaṅkara's BSBh. a number of interesting points arise. The various meditations occupy an important place in Śaṅkara's BSBh., as is well-known. Thus the general acceptance of the yoga methodology is very much in evidence here. Apart from the approval of the yoga methodology for spiritual progress, Śaṅkara's BSBh. also accords a very high place to yoga, including the divine powers that accrue to one practising yoga. There are places where yoga as a system is lauded and where Śaṅkara quotes Patañjali's Yogasūtras in support of his arguments[^804].He quotes frequently from Upaniṣads like the *Svetāśvatara*and *Muṇḍaka* for corroboration of yogic powers[^805]. He mentions *yama, niyama, dhyāna,samādhi* and other yogic means that help one in spiritual progress[^806]. He clearly believes in the acquisition of various superhuman powers (siddhis) like aṇimā, mahimā, paracittapraveśa, śarīranirmāṇa and so on[^807].

[^804]: "BSBh., II.4.12; IV. 1.10."

[^805]: "Ibid., III.2.5; 2.24."

[^806]: "Ibid., III.3.28; IV.1.9; 1.13."

[^807]: "Ibid., I.1.5; 3.27, 33; II.1.25; III.2.5, 21; 3.32, 37."

 But while accepting yoga's methods for spiritual progress, Śaṅkara does not, at any stage, dilute his opposition to the ontological stand of Sāṅkhya-Yoga, i.e., dualism. One must make and understand this clearcut distinction in the bhāṣya of Śaṅkara. It is one thing to use the method of logic of the Nyāya system in one's arguments; it is also perfectly normal to adopt the means prescribed by yoga for one's spiritual progress. But one cannot argue from that, that Śaṅkara also accepts all that yoga stands for. Nowhere does Śaṅkara compromise his total commitment to advaita; therefore, it is but natural for Śaṅkara to oppose the dualism of Śaṅkhya-Yoga throughout the BSBh.

-------------------------------------------------

**1.**BSBh., II.2.1. Also S. Sankaranarayanan, “Śrī Śaṇkara and Nyāyadarśana—a new perspective," *Adyar Library Bulletin*, 1990, pp, 111-50.

 In fact Śaṅkara has refuted the dualism of Sāṅkhya-Yoga in many ways and questioned many of its doctrines. While ruling out the insentient pradhāna as the cause of the universe under sūtra I.1.5, Śaṅkara in the same place admits the past and future knowledge of the yogis. In denying that the Sāṅkhya-Yoga stand has a Vedic basis[^808], Śaṅkara quotes from many Upaniṣads and asserts that it is māyā which is referred to by the word *ajā*and therefore, the Sāṅkhya-Yoga *pradhāna* has no Vedic authority. Strangely enough, in proving this, the power of yoga itself is cited, for Śaṅkara states that through the yoga of meditation the seers entered Brahman and saw the hidden power which is *māyā*[^809].Thus while yoga as a means is accepted, its principle of*pradhāna* is rejected.

[^808]: "Ibid., I.4.7, ff"

[^809]: "Ibid., I.4.9."

  Under sūtra II.1.1 the philosophy of Sāṅkhya-Yoga that admits a plurality of souls is criticised by stating categorically that the scripture of Kapila, i.e., Sāṅkhya and Yoga by implication, is antagonistic not only because it assumes an independent*prakṛti* but also because it admits a plurality of souls[^810].The same point is made under II.1.3. Śaṅkara upholds the methodology of yoga under this well-known sūtra as a means to enlightenment. Śaṅkara quotes from the *Bṛhadāraṇyaka*, the *Kaṭha* and finally from the *Yogasūtras* themselves to vindicate yogic methodology. But he attacks the claims of both Sāṅkhya and Yoga as means to liberation[^811].

[^810]: "Ibid., II.1.1."

[^811]: "Ibid., II.1.3."

  Liberation can only come through the realisation of the unity of the self which is declared as such by the Upaniṣads; Śaṅkara refutes Sāṅkhya and Yoga as soteriological systems. He thus says that both Sāṅkhya and Yoga are dualists and they do not perceive this unity of the self.

 Not satisfied with disputing the claims made by Sāṅkhya-Yoga with the help of the Upaniṣads and other texts, Śaṅkara tries to question their principles independently in the next section[^812]. Thus the very basis of an insentient *pradhāna* being the cause for creation is questioned. The series points to an intelligent ultimate principle, rather than to the insentient *pradhāna* of Sāṅkhya-Yoga, says Śaṅkara.

[^812]: "Ibid., II.2.1."

 Shifting the attention from *pradhāna*, whose basis for being the material cause of the manifested world was attacked and rebutted in the earlier sūtras, Śaṅkara now questions the notion of God being the efficient cause of the universe. In the introduction to sūtra II.2.37. Śaṅkara states that some, following Sāṅkhya and Yoga, conclude that God, who is the ruler of prakṛti and puruṣa, is just an efficient cause. The significant point here is that he includes Sāṅkhya-Yoga along with the Māheśvaras and the Vaiśeṣikas as among those who advocate the theory of God's being just an efficient cause of the universe. It is also important to notice that Śaṅkara draws attention to the Yoga doctrine and says that even admitting a special type of puruṣa over and above the other puruṣas will not solve the problem as that puruṣa is admitted to be indifferent to everything[^813].And he makes the statement that the ideas about God which the Sāṅkhya and Yoga adherents uphold are not logical. There seems to be an apparent contradiction in Śaṅkara admitting Īśvara as an efficient cause in the SāṅkhyaYoga system when earlier in II.1.3. he had already acknowledged only *pradhāna* to

[^813]: "Ibid., III.2.37."

be the sole cause for creation in Sāṅkhya-Yoga. As is well-known BS, II.2.37 is concerned with rebutting the idea that Īśvara is an efficient cause as it is in contradiction to the concept of unity advocated by Śaṅkara's advaita. So Śaṅkara, it seems, is grouping together all those systems which believe in Īśvara whether in a weak sense or in a strong sense, and dismisses all of them collectively. Thus one need not make much of this apparent contradiction in this context.

 Śaṅkarain one place advocates realisation of Brahman in saṃrādhana by the yogīs, where saṃrādhana is translated as samādhi[^814].But one does not get the impression that Śaṅkara is talking about samādhi in the yogic sense of saṃprajñāta samādhi. Samādhi is being used in the sense of devotion, dhyāna, ekāgratā, a looking inwards. It thus conforms to the Upaniṣadic upāsanā[^815].In fact, he uses the word and then feels the need to define it in order to make its meaning clear. He relies on śruti and smṛti for this statement[^816].Earlier in II.3.39. also Śaṅkara depends on śruti to show that samādhi is a means to self-realisation. While it appears that this is close to the yogic samādhi, Sankara's predilection for knowledge as the means to self-realisation makes this hard to believe. One should go back to sūtras II.1.3 & 4 where Śaṅkara makes it clear that he is willing to accept Sāṅkhya-Yoga so long as they do not go against śruti. He emphasises the fact that Brahman-realisation cannot be obtained either by Sāṅkhya knowledge or the path of Yoga independently of the Vedas. Liberation is a state of identity with Brahman[^817]and cannot be associated with any action. "Since no action can take place without bringing about some change in its locus, the self cannot be the basis of any action^(**5**).

[^814]: "Ibid., III.2.24."

[^815]: "saṃrādhanam ca bhaktidhyānapraṇidhānādyanuṣṭhānam."

[^816]: "pratyakṣānumānābhyām śrutismrtibhyāmityarthaḥ."

[^817]: "brahmabhāvaśca mokṣaḥ tasmānna saṃskāryopi mokṣaḥ."

 Śaṅkara in I.1.4 goes on to distinguish between meditation and knowledge by stating that meditation is a mental action while knowledge is not something one does[^818]. Knowledge is not what one does but which comes to us from direct perception and is a transcendental experience not dependent on human action or the act of meditation. Thus, one can only take saṃrādhana to be a means in the path to self-realisation. In III.4.26 & 27 Śaṅkara states that sacrifices, self-control and so on, are but the means to the emergence of self-knowledge. A hierarchy amongst these is also laid down, placing the yogic means of *śama*, etc., closer to knowledge than sacrifice. But everyone of them, whether internal or external, is only the means to knowledge which alone can result in self-realisation. Thus in III.4.26 Śaṅkara states the *siddhānta* that while knowledge can depend on other factors like karma, devotion, etc., for its emergence, once it has emerged it does not depend on any other factor for producing its own result, namely liberation[^819].In view of the above it becomes difficult to agree with Trevor Leggett when he mentions this sūtra as one where Śaṅkara confirms seeing Brahman in profound meditation[^820]. At best these things were all only indirect means for the final result of knowledge.

**5.**M.R. Yardi,"Brahmasūtrabhāṣya of Sri Shankaracharya",*Samvit*8, Sept. 1983, p. 23.

To come back to the discussion on the position of Yoga in the BSBh., in sūtras IV.1.7-11 Śaṅkara exalts the role of dhyāna and ekāgratāand he also defines them in this context. Śaṅkara defines dhyāna as that which induces a continuous stream of similar thoughts. This agrees with what Vyāsa states in the *Yogasūtrabhāṣya* (YSBh[^821] apica dhyāyatyartha eṣa yatsamānapratyayapravāhakaraṇam-BSBh. on IV.1.8. (2) tasmindeśe dhyeyālaṃbanasya pratyayasyaikatānatā sadṛśaḥ pravāhaḥ pratyayāntareṇāparāmṛṣtodhyānam-Vyāsabhāṣya on YS, III.2.").) Ekāgratā is also used as a synonym of dhyāna and there is no attempt to define ekāgratā further in yogic terms. If Śaṅkara wanted to talk about saṃprajñāta and asaṃprajñāta samādhi here was another opportunity which presented itself. But Śaṅkara does not do so. On the other hand, when one looks at the definition of dhyāna in the YSBHV by the Vivaraṇakāra, what strikes one is the un-Śaṅkara language and a rambling about the same idea in different ways[^822] sadṛśapravāhaḥ tulyapratyayānām pravāha ekākāraḥ pratyayasantānaḥ pratyayāntareṇa vijātīyena aparāmṛṣṭaḥ anākīrṇaḥ tat dhyānam-Vivaraṇa under YS, III.2.").Both these definitions are given in the notes and a comparison of them will convey the idea that is being discussed. Anyone looking at the two will be struck by the looseness and lack of crispness in the style of the Vivaraṇakāra. It is difficult to believe that Śaṅkara wrote in such a style. One interesting point is that Śaṅkara does not talk about samādhi here or elsewhere although, according to Patañjali, samādhi is indispensable for kaivalya. It seems that to Śaṅkara, the BSBh. author, dhyāna, ekāgratā, and samādhi all stand for the same thing and do not require extensive discussion. But the Vivaraṇakāra not only defines samādhi rather clumsily compared to Śaṅkara the BSBh. author, but also gets into a discussion about the difference between samādhi as means and samādhi as the end. He says that samādhi as the end is meant to signify a special state of the mind and samādhi as means is the stream of ideas entering into the very nature of the object of meditation, becoming one with the object itself[^823].

[^821]: "(1

[^822]: "tasmindeśe dhāraṇāvṛttiviṣaye nābhicakrādaudhyeyālambanasya dhyeyo deśādiḥ, tadālambanasya pratyayasya (ekatānatā

 At this point it will be interesting to compare the other two famous commentaries on the YSBh., the *Tattvavaiśāradī* (TV) and the *Yogavārttika* (YV) regarding this point. While Vācaspati Miśra in the TV does not bother to talk about samādhi as means and samādhi as end, Vijñānabhikṣu, very much like the Vivaraṇakāra, draws our attention to this distinction. This is one more point in favour of the argument that Bhikṣu was familiar with the Vivaraṇa, and should be added to the reference[^824]already pointed out.

[^824]: "Vārttika under YS, III.39."

 Śaṅkara refers to yogic powers at many places in the BSBh. In the bhāṣya on BS, IV.2.14., while talking about Śuka, he refers to the yogic *siddhis*. In sūtra IV.4.15 Śaṅkara recognises the power of the yogīto create new bodies. He also supports the yogic idea that the yogī's mind controls other minds. Śaṅkara even poses the question of the same *ātman* appearing as the separate rulers of the created bodies[^825]. In this context it is relevant to note that Bhikṣu also discusses whether the *nirmāṇasarīra*

[^825]: "evamekopi sanvidvānaiśvaryayogādanekabhāvamāpadya sarvāṇi śarīrāṇyāviśati. ekamanonuvartīni samanaskānyevāparāṇi śarīrāṇi satyasamkalpatvātsrakṣyati sṛṣṭeṣu ca teṣūpādhibhedādātmanopi bhedenādhiṣṭhātṛtvam yokṣyata eṣaiva ca yogaśāstreṣu yogināmaneka-śarīraprayogakriyā—BSBh. under IV.4.15."

has the same ātman or not. Bhikṣu takes the relationship between the ātman of the yogīand those of the created bodies as that between a whole and its parts[^826].Vācaspati Miśra does not raise this question at all while the Vivaraṇakāra discusses it in his usual loose style. Śaṅkara in the BSBh. very crisply concludes the argument of the ātman and does not raise the question of reaping or not reaping the fruits of actions not committed. But the Vivaraṇakāra is not able to keep his arguments tightly structured and lets himself be led into other topics[^827]. Looking at the style of the two, Śaṅkara and the Vivaraṇakāra, it is difficult to believe that both texts could have been written by the same person.

[^826]: "Rukmani, Yogavārttika of Vijñānabhikṣu, vol. IV, pp. 12ff."

[^827]: "kecittu kṣetrajñā apyanye pratikāyabhedam bhavantīti manvate. kecidatra codayanti akṛtābhyāgamam anye tu tadanurūpopārjitakarmaṇaḥ kṣetrajñā bhavantīti parihāramāhuḥ—-Vivaraṇa under YS, IV.4."

 This brief survey of the position of yoga in the BSBh. makes it clear thatŚaṅkara was not an opponent of the yoga system in so far as its methodology for mind purification goes. He also speaks favourably of the siddhis that yogīs can acquire. He also makes the distinction very much like the yogībetween the external and internal means of yoga. Thus while yama, niyama, etc., can be classified under external means dhyāna, samādhi, ekāgratā, śama, dama, etc., can be called the internal means. As Śaṅkara allows for the grace of Īśvara and talks of Īśvara (saguṇa Brahman) being proximate to nirguna Brahman, one can also say that there is scope for Īśvarapraṇidhāna in the yogic sense in the BSBh[^828].Unlike his opposition to Sāṅkhya,Śaṅkara also does not talk very disparagingly of yoga. But the moment one comes to the ontological position of yoga, Śaṅkara groups it along with Sāṅkhya and attacks them jointly for their dualistic stand. He is then uncompromising in his criticism.

[^828]: "BSBh. under 1.2.29."

 Would such a person have written a commentary on a commentary of the YS? His approval of the yogic means can explain, however weakly, a work like the *Yogatārāvalī*being attributed toŚaṅkara. But it is difficult to believe that an uncompromising advaitin like Śaṅkara would have written a commentary of the YS. A committed yogī like Bhikṣu wrote a commentary on the *Vedāntasūtras* and also independent works on the Vedānta system like the *Upadeśaratnamālā* and the *Brahmādarśa*. But in all these works he has brought in his yogic bias and attacked vehemently the advaita of Śaṅkara. It is thus natural for any committed person not to compromise his convictions. For these reasons it is difficult to believe that Śaṅkara, a committed advaitin, wrote the Vivaraṇa.

  In addition when one looks at the section dealing with Īśvara in the Vivaraṇa one comes across many more points difficult to imagine as coming from Śaṅkara the author of the BSBh.

 Under BS, I.1.5 the answer given in BSBh. to the Sāṅkhya objection, that before creation Brahman can see nothing as it has nobody, is very different from the way the Vivaraṇakāra answers a similar objection in the Vivaraṇa. Śaṅkara's answer draws attention to the fact that Brahman has eternal consciousness as a svarūpalakṣaṇa and so does not depend on a body for this. A transmigrating soul on the other hand, he says, depends on a body, etc., due to ignorance, but not God whose knowledge is free from obstacles. He quotes *Śvetāśvatara* III.19 and VI.6 in support of his arguments. TheSāṅkhya advocate questions his differentiating between God and soul as accord-

ing to the advaitin they are identical, (Bṛ. Up., III.VII.23). Śaṅkara answers that in truth there is no difference, but when there are limiting factors like a body, etc., then they are viewed differently.

Under the same circumstances the Vivaraṇakāra starts by saying in answer to the objection that Īśvara cannot be omniscient as he has nobody, that he has a body. But when it is pointed out that this will lead to Īśvara being non-eternal, he retreats and says Īśvara has nobody. To get out of the contradictory situation of God's both having and not having a body he then says that 'in the case of the same ātman which is in the process of liberation it has a body and when liberated it has no body'. How the argument shifts from Īśvara to an individual ātman is not made clear here. When the objection is raised that in the case of atman one is dealing with different times the Vivaraṇakāra just silences the opponent by saying that 'here also we understand different times' And the statement that follows is particularly surprising for he says, 'Moreover being Īśvara it is possible to be both at the same time and to have instruments and not to have instruments.'

 The entire argument is curious. In the case of Brahman and Īśvara, as there is a difference due to the presence of māyā, one can say that the one has instruments and the other does not have instruments. But in the system of yoga where Īśvara is the supreme puruṣa and there is none above Īśvara , how can he be both at the same time?

 It is significant that the Vivaraṇakāra quotes the same verse from the Kathopaniṣad, but not the whole verse as this would not suit his argument. The operative phrase in the verse is *'matvā dhīro na śocati'* The other two lines he quotes are also from the same Upaniṣad which Śaṅkara quotes in this context in BSBh., but they are from different chapters. But unlike Śaṅkara, who connects these quotations with his thesis by stating that it is thus proved that unembodiedness, called liberation, is eternal and different from the results of works that have to be performed', the Vivaraṇakāra leaves the arguments in mid-air and goes on to another objection. Somehow all of this does not fit into the style of Śaṅkara the Bhāṣyakāra.

 There are many difficult points in the Īśvara discussion, but it is not possible to go into all of them here. However under BS, II.1.3, as mentioned earlier, Śaṅkara states clearly that in the Yoga system as in Sāṅkhya, pradhāna is considered to create the universe independently[^829].In the *Yogasūtras* and the *Vyasabhāṣya* and following that in the Vivaraṇa, Īśvara acts as an efficient cause in the creation of the universe. If the author of the BSBh. and the Vivaraṇa were the same Śaṅkara how could this discrepancy be explained away regarding such an important concept of yoga?

[^829]: "tatrāpi śrutivirodhena pradhānam svatantrameva kāraṇam. -BSBh. under II.1.3."
