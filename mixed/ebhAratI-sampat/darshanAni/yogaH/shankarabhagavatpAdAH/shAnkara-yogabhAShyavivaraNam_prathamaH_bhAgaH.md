[TABLE]





In this two-volume work of critically translating the YogasÛtrabhâṣyavivaraṇa (YSBHV) of Śaṅkara, the Yogasûtras of Patañjali, and the bhâṣya of Vyâsa, all these three texts have been brought together for the first time. The question of the authorship of YSBHV has been a vexed one and has engaged the attention of scholars for a long time. In this work the authorship problem has been examined in great detail on the basis of both the internal and external evidences. The author has also drawn attention to some specific references to Vâcaspati Miśra in the body of the Vivaraṇa. This, hopefully, should settle once and for all the authorship problem.

**Preface**

The *Yogasūtrabhāṣyavivaraṇa* (YSBHV)—An annotated critical English translation, was the research project for which I was given a fellowship at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla, India in 1989–90. At that time I was not aware of TrevorLeggett translating the same work. When I had completed the Samādhipāda in 1990,Leggett's Samādhipāda translation came to my notice. But seeing the divergent approach of that translation from what I was doing, I decided to continue the work.Thus in spite of moving residences and jobs in the interim period (first to South Africa and then to Canada) I kept doggedly on and now it is ready at last.  

 

A number of my friends and colleagues have helped me in many ways in this workand I thank them all for their support. I would, however, like to specially mention Dr.C.S. Radhakrishnan of the Vivekananda College, Madras, India, who was instrumental in procuring some important Sanskrit material, without which this research wouldhave been incomplete.  

 

I take this opportunity to thank Kluwer Academic Publishers for allowing me the use of my published articles in their journals. With their kind permission I haveused material published earlier in their *Journal of Indian* *Philosophy*, vols. 20,1992, pp. 105-9, and 21, 1993, pp. 395-404 titled 'The Problem of the Authorship ofthe *Yogasūtrabhāṣyavivaraṇam*' and 'Sankara's views on Yoga in the *Brahmasūtrabhāṣya* in the light of the authorship of the *Yogasūtrabhāṣyavivaraṇa*' respectively.  

 

My husband S. Rajamani, has been of immense support throughout this period ofhard work and also helped in the preparation of the Index. I would like to record myappreciation for all his understanding and support.  

 

I dedicate this two-volume enterprise to my dear, departed parents. My mother,N.S. Parvathy, stood by me as a solid example of what women can achieve in spite ofthe great odds they are faced with. My father, T.V. Subramaniam, sowed the seeds ofcuriosity and questioning in my mind and was primarily responsible for my taking upSanskrit studies.  

 

Finally I would like to thank my Publisher Mr. Devendra Jain who exerted pressure on me to complete the work and brought it out in record time.

**Introduction**

Let me begin the introduction by pointing out how this two-volume work on the*Yogasūtrabhāṣyavivaraṇa* (YSBHV) differs from the translation that Trevor Leggetthad done of the same book (1992). Firstly this has all the three texts-the sūtras ofPatañjali, the bhāṣya of Vyāsa and the Vivaraṇa of the Vivaraṇakāra (VK). Thusfollowing the format of my earlier work, the *Yogavārttika* of Vijñānabhikṣu, the sūtratext is printed in 14 point black, the bhāṣya in 12 point black and the Vivaraṇa text in12 point white. I have used the single text of the YSBHV published in the MadrasGovernment Oriental Series no. 94 in 1952 edited by Sri P.S. Rama Sastri and Sri S.R. Krishnamurti Sastri for this work. I have kept the readings in this text as they are,including what is in brackets. While translating the YSBHV, I have used whicheverreading fits into the context better.No attempt has been made to arrive at a standardedition of the YSBHV text. I have not attempted a fresh translation of the sūtra andbhāṣya texts but have used my earlier translations in the *Yogavārttika*, with necessarychanges, whenever the readings were different. I have tried to divide the passages both in the bhāṣya and in the YSBHV keeping the trend of the arguments unbroken.In the body of the work the sutra texts have been indicated by italics and the bhāṣyatexts can be recognised by double inverted commas. Very often I have not attemptedto translate well-known Sanskrit words. 

 I have mentioned in the preface how I got to know of Leggett's translation onlyafter completing the first Samādhipāda. But now that the whole translation of Leggett'swork is available I would like to point out how this two-volume work on the sametext differs from it, in many ways.

 The advantage of having the sūtra, bhāṣya and YSBHV in one place is obvious toanyone who wants to consult them. The many positive responses I have had for myYogavārttika (YV) translation, which followed the same pattern, has encouraged meto stick to that format in this work as well.

 I have seen the exhaustive notes by Tuvia Gelblum on Leggett's translation in the *Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies[^1]*and the interested reader canrefer to it for further information. Gelblum has drawn attention to many points andhas also addressed the question of authorship of the YSBHV. While I agree basicallywith what Gelblum has to say, there are also some additional points to which I wouldlike to refer. I shall touch upon some, which are of special importance to my mind.  

[^1]: "Tuvia Gelblum, 'Notes on an English Translation of the Yogasutrabhāṣyavivaraṇa', Bulletin of theSchool of Oriental and African Studies, vol. LV, part I, 1992, pp. 76-89."

 Gelblum makes some observations on the word vārtā in sūtra III.36 and the manner in which Leggett has glossed over it[^2]. He has ably refuted Leggett's attempt to give a fanciful interpretation to *vārtā*. Gelblum points out Bhoja's explanation of

[^2]: "Ibid., pp. 84-87."



vārtā[^3]as also the occurrence of the word vārtā in the Śiva Purāṇa which is quoted by al-Biruni in the eleventh century AD. He has rightly said that Vācaspati Miśra (Miśra) could not have known of the reading *atītasya* in place of *vartamānasya* in the bhāṣyatext of III. 14 and infers that the Vivaraṇakāra (VK) must therefore be later than Miśra. As Vijñānabhikṣu (Bhikṣu) makes the same correction as the VK[^4],it supports whatGelblum says though he (Gelblum) does not seem to know of it. On the basis of his interpretation of YS, IV. 34[^5],Gelblum also argues for the VK being later than Bhoja(eleventh century AD).

[^3]: "vārtā gandhasaṃvit; vṛttiśabdena tāntrikyā paribhāṣayā ghrāṇendriyamucyate; vartate gandhaviṣaya iti kṛtvā vṛtterghrāṇendriyājjātā vārtā gandhasaṁvit-Bhojavṛtti under YS, III.36."

[^4]: "T.S. Rukmani, Yogavārttika of Vijñānabhikṣu, vol. III, p. 54."

[^5]: "Gelblum, op. cit., pp. 87-88."

 

I would add a few more observations on Leggett's work both with regard to style and content. First and foremost Leggett has a tendency to read more than what isthere in the text. Thus under sūtra 1.7 talking about *anumāna* (inference) and theinvariable relationship between two things, the VK uses two words *vadhya* (hunted)and *ghātaka* (hunter) in a general sense. But Leggett translates them specifically ascat (*ghātaka*) and mouse (*vadhya*) throughout the passage, without giving any explanation as to why he is doing so[^6].

[^6]: "YSBHV, pp. 79 ff"

 

Similarly Leggett attaches too much importance to the word Parameśvara undersūtra II.46 making it appear as if that alone denotes the Lord of all (a literal translation) and implies that somehow the Īśvaraof Yoga is limited[^7].I cannot understand how the Yoga Īśvara is limited when the set of sūtras I.23-29 clearly define him asunlimited. This salutation to an Almighty God would, if anything, make the YSBHVcontrary to what Leggett says, not the work of Śaṅkara. Śaṅkara's commentary onthe Gītā makes a *bhakta* surrender his everything to Īśvara in a sense of *samnyāsa* andthat is the salutation which he very often advocates in his *Gītābhāṣya.[^8]* The veryword Parameśvara is glossed over as *ātmā* in the*Gītā* in many places[^9].

[^7]: "Trevor Leggett, Sankara on the Yogasūtras, p. 41"

[^8]: "Bha. Gītā, XVIII.66"

[^9]: "Ibid., VI.30; XI.3; XIII. 13, 22."

 

Leggett also has the tendency to make definitive statements like "Śaṅkaramakessamādhi one of the necessary means to release[^10]." This is not quite what Śaṅkaraissaying and I have dealt with it in my paper on Śaṅkaraand Yoga (see appendix II tovol. II of this work). In citing *Upadeśasāhasrī* (UPA) I.19.2 and glossing 'others' as*yogin-s* and then inferring that there is a direct reference to YS, III.35 here, is againmisleading[^11]. The word 'others' is translated as Sāṅkhya-s by Ānandagiri and others[^12].Mayeda accepts this translation and says 'All commentaries consider this the view oftheSāṅkhyaand interpret *para* as 'puruṣa[^13]'.Thus Leggett's statement is not correct.In many places Leggett also freely translates the YSBHV without being faithful tothe text. This is seen specially in the portion dealing with the *īśvarakāraṇavāda* (1.25)and the sūtraon *śabda* (III.17). Leggett almost suggests that Śankara the BSBH

[^10]: "Trevor Leggett, op. cit., p. 27."

[^11]: "Ibid., p. 37."

[^12]: "... icchanti sānkhyāstadayuktam, Commentary by Ānandagiri, Padmapāda, Śrīmadvidyāraṇya, etc. UPA, 1.19.2."

[^13]: "S. Mayeda, A Thousand Teachings, pp. 203, 207"





author consciously wrote the YSBHV in order to replace with Vedāntic views the belief in the "plurality of separate *puruṣa-*s and the conscious *pradhāna* as source of the world" which are the Yoga views he criticizes in the *Yogapratyuktaprakaraṇa*[^14].Leggett is also not always faithful to the text in his translation (see later). All this gives the impression that Leggett's translation seems to address itself to the general reader.

[^14]: "'Leggett, op. cit., pp. 18 and 28"

 

Leggett finds similes used by the VK, “brilliant” and in his judgement "original" contributions of the VK[^15].I would like to look at some of his examples in a different way. For instance the statement in the YSBHV that an "expert's estimate of a gold's weight by merely looking at it" can be compared to a similar statement in the *Vākyapadīya* about an expert's knowledge of the genuineness of precious stones and gems born of practice[^16].So also, sensory perceptions leaving their impressions, is only a variation of modifications taking on the shape of the objects, like liquid copper placed in a crucible[^17]; *mudrā* and *pratimudrā* are just the same imagery as *bimba* and *pratibimba* which are widely used in Hindu thought. As for the equality theory is it not already there in the bhāṣya of Vyāsa?

[^15]: "Ibid., P. 42"

[^16]: "VP, 1.35"

[^17]: "T.S. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. I, p. 44 and UPA, I.14.3"

 

The greatest shortcoming of Leggett's work is the lack of an index which makes it almost inaccessible to all but the one who already knows the Yoga school well enough to know where to look for the information sought. Thus, while on the one hand the work seems to have the general reader in mind, on the other, not having an index, makes it useful only for a scholar of Yoga.And the shortcomings that the work has for a Yoga-scholar have already been touched upon.

**VIVARAṆA AND YOGA**

 

I am certain that Śaṅkara the *Brahmasūtrabhāṣyakāra* (BSBHK) is not the author of the YSBHV and so I am calling the author of the YSBHV as the VK both in the introduction and in the body of the main work.

 

The YSBHV studies have been overshadowed by the question of its authorship since it was first noticed by Ramakrishna Kavi (discussed later in the Introduction) so that it becomes difficult to separate the study of the contents of the YSBHV from the question of its authorship. Thus the following pages will go back and forth comparing the ideas and contents of the YSBHV along with pointing out Śaṅkara's own preferences as found in the BSBH.

 

I have tried to follow Mayeda's suggestion in his *A Thousand Teachings[^18]* where he says, "In fact we should define Śaṅkara as the author of the *Brahmasūtrabhāṣya*, and use it as the yardstick against which to measure the authenticity of other works ascribed to him[^19]." It is unfortunate that Mayeda himself did not follow his own dictum and tacitly assumed the YSBHV to be Śaṅkara's work without testing it against the BSBH. Mayeda for instance, mentions thatŚaṅkara probably is indebted to the YS and the *Vyāsabhāṣya* for his usage of *vṛtti* and *pratyaya*; but to jump from that to

[^18]: "Mayeda, op. cit., Introduction, p. 6."

[^19]: "Ibid.,P.35"



state "Śaṅkara as the author of the YSBHV, also uses *pratyaya* as a synonym of *vṛtti*" is rather rash[^20].It is well-known that the BSBHK makes use of the YS for his understanding of *pratyakṣa*, *vṛtti* and *pratyaya*. But how does that tie up with the author of the YSBHV being the same as the BSBHK. One can very well say that it is the VK (whicheverŚaṅkara he was) who is indebted to the BSBHK and the UPA for his descriptions under YS, I.7; IV.17, 22....But to conclude from this that the BSBHKis the author of the YSBHV is beyond my comprehension. At the most it can only be a conjecture.

[^20]: "Ibid., p. 62, n. 34."

 In order not to confuse the two i.e., the YSBHV contents with the authorshipquestion, I shall deal with the contents of the YSBHV first and keep the question ofthe author confined to those limits in the initial part of the Introduction. The subsequent part will address itself exclusively to the authorship problem.

THE YOGASŪTRABHĀṢYAVIVARAŅA

 The first point that strikes anyone reading the YSBHV is its loose style. The two benedictory verses and the set of verses at the end are inferior in quality and stylistically defective (i.e., there is *chandobha*ṅ*gaḥ*). (For more details see Appendix I tovol. II of this work[^21].) The conclusion is that the BSBHK, could not have written suchinferior Sanskrit prose and composed such bad verse.

[^21]: "Also cf. G.C. Pande, Life and Thought of Śankarācārya, pp. 111-12"

 In Sanskrit one denotes a clear, fluid and simple writing without complicated compounds and unnecessary flourishes as the Vaidarbhīrītiḥ[^22].Its opposite would be the Gaudīrītiḥ which has a profusion of compounds and is pompous[^23]. The YSBHV is certainly not a work written in the Vaidarbhĩ style. The work as a whole lacks clarityof thought and is full of repetitions[^24]. The VK very often also repeats entire bhāṣyapassages without adding a single word by way of explanation and uses the bhāṣya tospeak for itself within the body of the YSBHV[^25].He does that in almost fifty-six sūtraswherein the VK hardly gives his understanding of the bhāṣya. That speaks poorly ofthe VK's general approach to the subject.

[^22]: "mādhuryavyañjakairvarṇai racanā lalitātmikā, avṛttiralpavṛttirvā vaidarbhī rītiriṣyate—R.K. Deb,Śabdakalpadruma, vol. 4, p. 510"

[^23]: "ojaḥ prakāśakairvarṇairbandha āḍambaraḥ punaḥ, samāsabahulā gauḍī . . .—ibid., vol. 2, p. 370."

[^24]: "Cf. YSBHV, under 1.6, 7, 18, 25; II.3, 4, 19, 23; III.14, 15, 17; IV.22"

[^25]: "Cf. 1.21, 31, 32, 41, 42, 43, 47, 49; II.2, 5, 9, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 24, 34, 40, 41, 44, 51, 54; III.6, 8, 11,13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 22, 23, 30, 33, 36, 38, 41, 42, 47, 48, 51, 52, 54, 55; IV. 1, 9, 14, 21, 23, 24, 25, 29, 32.33, 34."

 As opposed to the style of the VK one should remember that the style of Śaṅkara,as G.C. Pande mentions[^26]is “fluent and lucid, simple and profound, always focusedand relevant, without any rhetorical flourishes of pedantry, logical in reasoning butwithout any scholastic formalism". The VK is full of scholastic formalism. In somesections like the proofs for the existence of īśvarathe VK writes very much like aNaiyāyika arguing through syllogistic reasoning the case for the existence of īśvara[^27]. It is important to remember in this connection that the arguments for the existence of

[^26]: "Pande, op. cit., p. 108"

[^27]: "YSBHV, pp. 58-61 utpattimati ca pṛthivī sāvayavatvāt, ghaṭādivat, and many more such argumentation."





Īśvara using Nyāya methodology, gained popularity after the time of Udayana (tenth century CE) who wrote his two famous works-*Kusumāñjalī* and *Bauddha-dhikkāra*.After Udayana's incisive dialectical skills displayed in these works, it became thefashion to emulate his style particularly in establishing the existence of Īśvara. Thereis no doubt that the VK resorts to this style whenever the opportunity presents itselfthroughout the work[^28]. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the VK lived at least acentury or two later than Udayana. When we contrast this style with that of the BSBHKwe find that the BSBHK relies on *śruti* as a sufficient proof for the existence ofīsvara[^29]and he "advances rational teleology as simply of enough weight to counterany rational atheism or naturalism[^30]." What the BSBHK accomplishes through a fewlines on Īśvara takes the VK quite a few pages to achieve; this section (1.25) is in factthe largest in the entire YSBHV. The next largest section under III.17 also exhibitsthe same pedantic argumentation. There are similar analogies used in the BSBH andthe YSBHV and scholars arguing for the identity of the two Śańkaras have mademuch of these similar analogies in the two works[^31]. Similar analogies, especially in theSanskrit context and when dealing with philosophical argumentation need not meanthat there is an identity of authorship. If the VK is later than Udayana, then he has theadvantage of having access to the BSBH and the common analogies in the YSBHVand the BSBH need not pose any problem whatsoever.

[^28]: "YSBHV, under YS, 1.7, 25, 43; II.5, 12, 13, 14 15, 18; III.17, 44; IV.12, 15"

[^29]: "Cf. BSBH, I.1.3; II.1.25-27; 2.1, 26; III.2.30, 38; etc"

[^30]: "Pande, op. cit., P. 310"

[^31]: "Wilhelm Halbfass, Tradition and Reflection, pp. 212-17; Leggett, op. cit.,pp. 25-29."

 Leaving for the moment the comparison of the Īśvara arguments let us look atsome of the other points made by the VK. In the arguments for the nature of Īśvarathe VK indulges in some quibbling about whether "ignorance can also have the reaching of a limit like knowledge[^32]", and "the meaning of the word Īśvara cannot be onethat is *sarvajña*[^33]” which do not help in keeping the subject focused. They also do notadd to further the philosophical intent of the topic in hand, whatever else they mightachieve. The VK's sojourn into proving the existence of *tamas* (darkness) as a substance makes one wonder what school of philosophy he is advocating. Since Yoga,Nyāya and Advaita do not accept darkness as a substance the VK must be arguingfrom the side of the Mīmāmsaka[^34].While the VK does come up with some interestingviews in his defence of Īśvarabeing omniscient and omnipotent, and in his defenceof darkness as a substance, the focus of the work is totally in disarray and the sojournsare too long and irrelevant to the central theme.

[^32]: "YSBHV, p. 58."

[^33]: "Ibid., pp. 61 ff."

[^34]: "bid.,P. 70."

 Under YS, I.7 the VK again goes off the track to discuss *upamāna*, *arthāpatti* and *abhāva* under the means of knowledge (*pramāṇas*)[^35]. Even if he wanted to show off is knowledge of other systems the VK could have stayed within the parameters ofthe three *pramāṇas* accepted by Yoga. He instead goes into a lengthy journey (pp.27-32) discounting *upamāna* and *arthāpatti* as independent *pramāṇas*. Śańkarainthe BSBH hardly discusses the *pramāṇas* and very often the words *pratyakṣa* and*anumāna* only denote *śruti* and *smṛti* respectively[^36]." The six *pramāṇas* of the Advaita

school were the formulation of later advaitins—

of course keeping in view Śańkara'sgeneral approach to the means of knowledge in the BS and other works. But nowheredoes the BSBHK "give any systematic account of the *pramāṇas*[^37]."

[^37]: "BSBH, I.1.1, 2; 3.28; II.1.1, 11, 13; 2.28; III.2.21; 4.51; 3.14; IV.4.20."

 The YSBHV under YSBH, III.17 again tells us something about the author and hisapproach to the problems of sound and meaning which is not the same as that of theBSBHK. In this section the VK quotes some verses from Kumārila's *Ślokavārttika*(ŚV) and goes into a long-winded, pedantic, grammatical discussion which tests thepatience of the reader[^38].It is interesting to note in the discussion here that the VKseems to prefer the word *sāmānya* in place of *ākṛti* in the sense of genus[^39].But whatcomes as a real surprise is the acceptance of *spho*ṭ*a* by the VK in this context[^40].Nowhere does the BSBHK accept *sphoṭa* and this in itself should prove a stumblingblock for the identity of the VK and the BSBHK[^41]. As for the BSBHK being familiarwith the works of Kumārila, many scholars have pointed out that "the actual evidencefor Śańkara's acquaintance with the works of Kumārila is scarce and references tothem in the recognised works ofŚańkara are very rare[^42]". Recent researches havepushed the date of Śańkara nearer to the time of Kumārila[^43].Śaṅkaranārāyaṇan andPande have studied a number of works and have answered the questions regardingthe references from the *Pramāṇaviniścaya* and the *Alambanaparīkṣā* on which basically the present date forŚańkara of 788-820 CE is decided. Their exhaustive researches have led them to place Śańkara closer to the time of Kumãrila i.e., 650–700CE. Earlier writings by Hacker and others had also argued for an earlier date for Śańkara[^44]. There is no reason to disregard these researches that placeŚańkara closer tothat of Kumārila. This can answer the "lack of evidence to Maṇḍana's works" inŚańkara and the familiarity of the VK with the ŚV as also with the works of Śańkara the BSBHK. Whether we accept an earlier date for Śańkara or not, the VK's acceptance of *sphoța* certainly poses problems of identity withŚańkara the BSBHK. Asmentioned above, apart from the *sphoța* acceptance the manner of refutation andquotations of large groups of verses[^45]as seen in this section from Kumārila's ŚV arejust not the style of the BSBHK. The BSBHK usually prefers brief quotes and statesthem directly within the body of his commentary itself. His bhāṣya flows as one text,along with the quotes, and nowhere do the quotes stand apart and jar the flow.

 There are a number of grammatical flaws in the YSBHV, some of which could bedue to the carelessness of the scribe. But the use of *abhidhāyiṣyante* in two places and



that too while quoting it from the bhāṣya which has the correct form abhidhāsyante is perplexing. Since the VK himself uses the correct form later[^46]YSBHV, p. 35 . . . cittamalaprasangenābhidhāyiṣyante (under 1.8).(2)YSBHV, p. 126 same thing is repeated . . . cittamalaprasangenābhidhāyiṣyante(3)YSBHV, under II.33. . . abhidhāsyamānena prakāreņa")we do not know what tomake of it. It needs to be said however, that the BSBHK would not have made such amistake. Even if the VK had this reading in front of him, due to the error of the scribe,he should have corrected it as he in fact does in a number of other grammatical explanations in the YSBHV.

[^46]: "(1

 Apart from the partiality to Nyāya methodology that the VK displays he is alsofond of grammatical sojourns[^47].Leggett also notices this and points to the resemblances of the YSBHV with the Kāśikā itself[^48]which will certainly make the work later than the BSBH.

[^47]: "YSBHV, under 1.9, 13, 27; II.5, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19. More examples are given in the body of the work"

[^48]: "Leggett,op,cit.,pp 34-35"

 Another factor that stands out in the YSBHV is the lack of quotations uniformlythroughout the work. In fact, except in the Ī

ṡvara section (1.25) and the Sādhanapāda,the work as a whole has very few *śruti* references. The BSBH just brims with Vedicreferences from the word go.

 If one can forget the authorship question and look at the YSBHV as a work on theYoga school of thought, then it can be rated as a major contribution in the field ofYoga studies. The sojourns into Nyāya, Mīmāmsā and Vyākaraṇa are in themselves extremely instructive and indicates that the VK was a learned scholar. The VK has amature mind and in terms of argumentation and original ideas no one will call theYSBHV an immature work. Its vigorous and penetrating criticism of Buddhism hasbeen noted by Halbfass. The discussion under YS, I.25, 32; IV.14, 16, 19, 23, 24makes him conclude that "In general we find here a sharp critical sense of problemsconcerning the temporal constitution of acts and contents of awareness[^49]." We cannotquarrel with the contents of the YSBHV in which the VK passes with flying colours. But it is his style and manner of writing that puts one off and which cannot place himin the same category as the BSBH author.

[^49]: "Halbfass, op. cit., pp. 214-15."

 The rest of the Introduction willspecifically address itself to the question of theidentity of the BSBHK with the VK.

**THE QUESTION OF IDENTITY OF THE VK TO THE BSBHK**

 Ramakrishna Kavi is the first scholar to have discussed the YSBHV and it is in the*Journal of Andhra Historical Research*, vol. 2, pt. 2, pp. 134-36 titled "Literary Leanings[^50]",that we get the first reference to the YSBHV. Kavi mentions here that theYSBHV was written by "one Śaṅkarācārya” and that it was also called the*Bhagavatpādīya* in one of the colophons[^51]. One is not sure which colophon Kavi isreferring to. As the colophons in the present text do not contain this, it could be areference to anyone of the other two manuscripts that have been mentioned by  

[^50]: "Gelblum has mentioned this in his notes."

[^51]: "Kavi, LL, p. 134"




Halbfass[^52].However, Halbfass does not seem to be aware of this early reference totheYSBHV by Kavi.[^53]Kavi refers to a commentary on the *Śabarabhāṣya* ascribed to Śaṅkarācārya and called *Bhāṣsyapradīpa*.He also mentions that in one of the colophons of this work the scribe concluded by stating that it is a work of PayyürBhagavatpāda[^54].Kavi further goes to the extent of saying that this Śaṅkara could havebeen the author of the many *Jayamaṅgalas (JM).[^55]*At least one JM has been noticedby Halbfass as mentioning Śaṅkarabhagavat as its author in the colophon[^56].There isanother work, the *Bhaṭṭikāvyavyākhyā*, also called JM which is attributed toŚaṅkarapūjyapādayati.E.Easwaran Nampoothiry (Nampoothiry) wonders whetherthis is the same Śaṅkarapūjyapāda mentioned in the *Svaditaṃkaraṇī* (SVA) ofRṣiputraparameśvara[^57]. Going back to the YSBHV, Kavi even thinks that the acceptance of *sphoṭa* by the VK is in keeping with Parameśvara's commentary on verses712-17 from the SV of [Kumārila.](#) The reader can consult the notes for more detailson this topic.Kavi further quotes the colophon from the *Nyāyakaṇikā* (NK) commented on by Parameśvara which mentions him to be the *śiṣya* of Śrīmacchankarapūjyapāda.[^46] itiśrīmadṛṣigaurīnandanaśrīmadbhavadāsapitṛvya śrīmacchańkarapūjyapādaśiṣyaparmeśvarakṛtausvaditaṅkaraṇyām tṛtīyaḥ ślokaḥ.

 In order to find out more about this Śaṅkarapūjyapāda we have to go to the history of Sanskrit literature in Kerala. One Śaṅkarais mentioned as belonging to the famousPayyūr Bhaṭṭathirippād family which as K.K. Raja points out "exists even now in thevillage called Porkalam, on the suburbs of the town of Kunnamkulam" in Kerala.[^59].")"

 Kavi, op. cit., pp. 134-5. This is what Kavi says:

 Under the 27th Sloka in the Sphotasiddhi Mandanamiśra quotes a few slokas (712-17) from Ślokavärttika of Kumarila and Paramesvara in interpreting them, according to the older reading, changes the main line of argument. He says with reference to the 713th śloka-tatpurvam pratipadanāditi patho ratnākara-käsikayoḥ, nibandhanakāreņa tu pūrvam tatpratipadanäditi pätho 'ngikṛtah. gavādeḥ purvam gakarādeḥ pratipadanadityarthaḥ vyaptistu yatpūrvam yatpratipadyate tattasya pratipadakam yathā pradīparohanam pratipadasya ghatasyeti purvavad draṣṭavyä.

 Mandanamiśra reads 'purvam tatpratipadanat' in his vrtti on the 27th sloka. Even Umbeka in his commentary on Slokavārtika follows the same reading. Later on owing to some difficulty in maintaining the Mimamsaka's position against Bhartṛhari, a different reading was probably adopted.

  Paramesvara's interpretation, according to the above argument, is that which is in agreement with that of the Vivarana's interpretation accepting sphota. And the Gopalikā author Parameśvara is following the line of argument of his uncle or preceptor Sankaracarya as given in the Vivarana.

 Whether Sankara was Parameśvara's uncle or his revered preceptor is another question to be answered. But the point being made is that, while this Vivarana author Sankara accepts sphota, the BSBHK. Sankararejectsit.



Amongst the famous poets (*kavigal*) at the court of Manavikrama theGreat,ofthefifteenthcenturyCE[^60],therewereninescholarsbelonging to the Payyūr family "including Ṛși and his son Parameśvara[^61]". The members of the Payyūr family were famous in Kerala and their surviving works deal mainly with Mīmāmsāand Kāvya.But it can in no way suggest that they did not write works on other systerns of philosophy as well.[^62]That some important works have been lost is amply evidenced by the reference to *Juşadhvaṃkaraṇī* (which is not available) in the SVA (which is available)[^63].Given in the notes is the table of six generations of the Payyūr family one of whom is referred to asŚaṅkarapūjyapāda⁵

by Parameśvara I.

 Great scholars bearing the name Śaṅkara are not difficult to find in Kerala. In fact, Śaṅkara is such a common name like Nārāyaṇa and Parameśvara that even the famous Śaṅkara, the BSBHK had another Śaṅkara as his contemporary, who is the author of the play *Āścaryacūḍāmaṇi[^64].*There was also another Śaṅkaranārāyaṇa (in short Śaṅkara) who is the author of the Vivaraṇa on the *Laghubhāskarīya* of Bhāskarācārya also known as Ś*aṅkaranārāyaṇīyam*[^65]. There is also a Śaṅkarapujyapādayati who is the author of the *Bhaṭṭikävyavyākhyā* called *Jayamaṅgala* mentioned earlier in this Introduction[^66]. While it may not be relevant to the YSBHV discussion it is also good to know that *pūjyapāda* is only a term of respect and can be used as an adjective to any guru and is not an exclusive epithet used for the BSBHK alone. Thus Parameśvara Nambutiri (1350-1450) known as Dṛggaṇitakāra is mentioned as the author of *Vākhyāvalī* *Jyotiṣa* and is the disciple of Rudra[^67];the *năndī verse* in this work addresses his *guru* Rudra as *pūjyapāda*[^68].

⁵The table is given by all authors who have written on Kerala Sanskrit literature such as Ullur Paramesvara Iyer (Malayalam), K.K. Raja, S. Venkatasubramonia Iyer, E. Easwaran Nampoothiry and many others. The table is consistent except in the number of sons that the first Parameśvara had. According to most of the above authors he had five sons, only K.Rama Pisharoti says he had eight sons. K.K. Raja has discounted this and established that Parameśvara I had five sons and not eight (CKCL, p. 95). One of the sons was Śaṅkara and Parameśvara II the author of *Gopālikā* was his disciple. He refers to his *guru* as *pūjyapāda*. The following table is taken from K.K. Raja (CKCL, p. 98):

 The second person after Kavi who was also emphatic in denying the authorship of the YSBHV by Śaṅkara is S.K. Ramanatha Śāstrī which is also noted by Halbfass[^69].Śāstrī in his edition of the *Sphoṭasiddhi* (SS) of Maṇḍana, along with the *Gopālikā* of Parameśvara of the payyūr family, has found a set of verses quoted from the YSBHV text in the *Gopālikā* (Madras, 1931). This definitely indicates that this Parameśvara knew of the YSBHV. This Parameśvara also wrote commentaries on the *Tattvabindu*, *Nītitattvāvirbhāva* and *Vibhramaviveka*[^70]. Halbfass also says that "the verses in the Gopālikā from the ŚV may well have been written with the knowledge of the YSBHV's treatment of the topic[^71]".But he also has some difficulty in reconciling this with Parameśvara's work *Tattvabindu* which criticizes the *sphoṭa* theory[^72]. There should be no problem with this as the tradition did throw up flexible "pandit commentators[^73]" like Miśra himself. It is only if one assumes the VK to be identical with the BSBHK as Halbfass has done[^74], will this be a problem. The VK could very well accept the *sphoṭa* while commenting on a Yoga work and reject it while commenting on Miśra's work. The VK will only be emulating Miśra himself, whom he certainly held in high esteem.

[^73]: "Ibid., p. 242, n. 125"

[^74]: "Ibid., p. 207"

 Going back to Śāstrī's edition of the SS we find that he has some interesting observations to make. Thus at the end of the commentary on the third verse of the *Svaditańkaraṇī* by Parameśvara there is a definite statement of the author being the śisya of Śańkarapūjyapāda.'[^75] on p. xvi; in this introduction; S.K. Rāmanātha Śāstrī, op. cit., Foreword, p. xiii") He also pays homage to his guru Śrīśaṅkarapūjyapāda at the end of the work.[^76]The repeated references to Śaṅkarapūjyapāda by Parameśvara means that there was such a person in his life. That he could not have been the BSBHK is because the date of Parameśvara cannot be pushed earlier than the fifteenth century CE. The YSBHV references in the SS also tell us that the YSBHV cannot be placed later than that date. Śăstrī goes further and identifies this Śaṅkara as the author of the Sāṅkhya work the *Jayamaṅgala*[^77]." As Halbfass mentions "readers of this work will hardly feel tempted to attribute it to the author of the BSBH or to the author of the YSBHV"[^78]. On the same lines I would state that the readers of the YSBHV will hardly feel tempted to attribute it to the BSBHK. Śāstrī also states that at some point he read the following line in the original manuscript of the Vivaraṇa-*idam payyūr* *bhagavadpādakṛtam*[^79]...." But as he did not make a note of it at that time he is not able to state where in the YSBHV, he saw it. It is not there in the 1952 edition of the YSBHV.

[^75]: "Cf. n. 8 (1

[^76]: "ayam guruḥ śrīmacchańkarapūjyapādaśca granthante ca smaryate' nena yathā—śrīmacchaṇkarapūjyasya śisyena....teneyam vyākriyā kr̥tā" iti—ibid.,pxiv."

[^78]: "Halbfass, op. cit., p. 220."

[^79]: "Rāmanātha Śāstrī, op. cit., p. xv."

 From the above we can draw a few conclusions:

 1. A Śaṅkarapūjyapāda wrote the YSBHV.  
 2. It definitely existed in the fifteenth century.



 3.We do not get any certain information about the identity of this Śaṅkarapūjyapāda at this point beyond astrong indication that he is the guru of Parameśvara I.

 If we now turn our attention to the literature produced in Kerala uptil about thethirteenth and fourteenth centuries of the Common Era we find that most of the worksdealt with Kāvya, Jyotiṣa, Vyākaraṇa, Tantra, Āyurveda, Stuti-s (Stotra-s), Nāṭaka,Pūrvamīmāmsā and Uttaramīmāmsā[^80].Ullur Paramesvara Iyer, who is uniformly considered as an authority on the history of Kerala literature, even remarks that Śaṅkarahad to go out of Kerala which was steeped in *karmakāṇḍa*, to look for a competentguru to initiate him into *samnyāsa[^81].*Ullur also refers to the study of the Vedas,Vyākaraṇa, Mīmāmsā (both schools), proficiency in *paurohitya* (performance of rituals), reading and reciting of the epics and fine arts centered in temples, as the earlyforms of Sanskrit learning in Kerala[^82].Kerala also had the custom of earmarking different groups of people to cultivate and systematise special branches of Sanskrit learning even outside the circle of brāhmaṇa families. Thus the Vaidya families specialised in Āyurveda, the Asans (Asari) were well versed in Śilpaśāstra-s, the Kaniyarswere proficient in Jyotiṣa. This widespread Sanskrit learning in Kerala has been particularly noted by Marco Polo in the thirteenth century[^83]. But in spite of this wide-spread interest there is a paucity of philosophical works dealing with Nyāya-Vaiśeṣikaand Sāṅkhya-Yoga systems till very much later in Kerala. K.K. Raja supports thissurmise when he says that "Tarka became popular in Kerala only recently[^84]", and citessome works belonging to the nineteenth century as examples[^85]." K.K. Raja does notmention a single Sāṅkhya or Yoga work in his Appendix to his Sanskrit literature,though he talks about Vedic exegesis, Dharmaśāstra, Vedānta, Mīmāmsā, Tarka,Tantra, Jyotiṣa, Āyurveda, Vyākaraṇa, literary criticism and fine arts. The Index toSanskrit works in Kerala prepared separately by Venkitasubramonia and Nampoothirypaint the same picture. Thus we may conclude that Sāṅkhya and Yoga were not takenup for serious study till much later in Kerala.

 We come across some observations in the YSBHV which are not easy to account for under the above circumstances. The critical observation of the VK regarding the different conceptions of *mokṣa* in Sāṅkhya and Yoga are difficult to reconcile if oneconsiders the VK to be the same as the BSBHK, whose date cannot be pushed furtherthan the eighth century CE under any circumstances[^86].This, however, does not preclude the general acquaintance with Yoga theories, belief in Yogic siddhis, practiceof Yoga as a means to spiritual realisation, etc., which were all part of the Keralareligious atmosphere and was the common inheritance of a Keraliya born into families such as Śaṅkara's. While that can account for the *Yoga* presence in the BSBH, theascription of the *Yogatārāvalī* and the *Vijṛṃbhita*-*Yogasūtrabhāṣya* to the BSBHKis not so easy to accept and is suspect. In fact, Citsukha attributes the *Yogatārāvalī* to

[^86]: "YSBHV, p. 147-tathā ca vyāsaḥ sāńkhyānām yoginām ca pṛthanmokṣam darśayati."



Govindapāda or alternately to Śaṅkara[^87]. Thus the tradition is vague and not unanimous regarding authorship of the *Yogatārāvalī*. Pande discusses this authorship question in his *Life and Thought of Śaṅkarācārya* and rightly questions the basis of thisbelief[^83].

After Kavi and Śāstrī and after a lapse of twenty years, we get the YSBHV published by the Madras University and edited by P.S. Rama Śāstrī and S.R. KrishnamurthyŚāstrī. In the preface to this work itself the editors state unequivocally that it is thework of Śaṅkarabhagavadpāda, the BSBHK. But somehow their arguments do notring true and leave one with the feeling that enough research has not been undertakenby these two editors, before reaching such an important conclusion. The lack of certainty of Śaṅkara being the author of the YSBHV and being the author of BSBH, isequated with the arguments of lack of certainty regarding the identity of authorshipof the YS and the *Mahābhāṣya* and the lack of certainty and the ambiguity regardingthe two Vyāsas (the BS author and the YS bhāṣya author[^89]).But there is a world ofdifference between these arguments. While one Patañjali is known for his *Mahābhāṣya*(second BCE) the other (or the same) Patañjali brought together under one roof, thevarious yogic ideas at the time (or at the same time). Since Patañjali the YS author isnot opposed to *sphoṭa* and the Mahābhāṣyakāra does not repudiate Yoga (to the bestof my knowledge) we are not engaging in the same order of argumentation in the twocases. The editors themselves weaken their case when further on they state that"Patañjali's authorship of the YS and Vedavyāsa's authorship of the YSBH are attested to by many other references to them in a number of works[^90]." Thus they havereally not made any case for the identity of the VK and the BSBHK. Continuing onthe same lines, the editors say that the only real evidence in support of the identification is the colophon at the end of each pāda. But again in the same breath they addthat one cannot also place too much reliability on the colophons of manuscripts[^91].Since the editors themselves have questioned their own evidence we need not consider that argument of any serious value. Thus, so far the editors have not given usany significant evidence or made out any case for the YSBHV to be considered thework of the BSBHK. They also state that no reference attributing this YSBHV to Śaṅkara is found in the tradition which then is further undermining their own theory.(I shall show later how there is at least one reference to the YSBHV by a later Yogawriter.)

[^89]: "YSBHV,Foreword, p.ix."

[^90]: "Ibid., p. xiii"

[^91]: "... though it must be conceded in the same breath, that the reliability of the colophons of ourmanuscripts is not always beyond question"- Ibid., p. xiii "

 

Another argument for the authorship identity question mentioned by the editors isthe common name Vivaraṇa used in the commentaries on the *Ch*ā*ndogyopaniṣad,*the *Adhyātmapaṭala* and the YSBHV[^92]. This is indeed a naive statement. Vivaraṇalike *vyākhyā, saṅgraha, vṛtti, vimarśinī, bhāṣya* (and many other words) has beenused profusely for secondary literature in Sanskrit and Vivaraṇa itself has been verypopular in Kerala. But the comment of the editors "lastly the style of the present work

[^92]: "Ibid., pp. xiii and xiv."



and the manner of exposition also bear the characteristic stamp of Śaṅkara's writings[^93]" cannot be accepted at its face value (cf. earlier in this Introduction on the styleof the YSBHV). One is also surprised to note that the editors do not seem to be awareof the earlier references to the YSBHV, especially the SS edited by Rāmanātha Śāstrī,though it is also published from Madras as already mentioned, in the Madras University Series, like the YSBHV itself.

[^93]: "Ibid., p. xiv."

 The big problem which the editors face and which is also faced by all others likeHacker et al. who believe in the identity theory is the *Yogapratyuktaprakaraṇa* of theBS and Śaṅkara's bhāṣya on it.**²** The editors do not satisfactorily answer this head oncollision with Yoga and its outright dismissal by Śaṅkara the BSBHK. How can sucha one write a bhāṣya on the system he dismisses? The editors and others like Hacker,Mayeda and Leggett can only point out that Śaṅkara is not opposed to Yoga and the*Yogaśāstra* and therefore could have written this YSBHV. Everyone of these scholars knows that not being opposed is not the same thing as believing wholeheartedly init. Using Śaṅkara's own *Ardhajarjarī-Nyaya*[^94]we can only say that one cannot accepthalf of something and reject the other half completely. Śaṅkara also was not opposedto Nyāya logic and reasoning but we do not find any work of Śaṅkara on the bhāsyaof Vātsyāyana, similar to the YSBHV on the YSBH, nor even a commentary on the*Gautamasūtras* of Nyāya. Perhaps this was due to Śaṅkara not being sympathetic toNyāya or because Śaṅkara was totally committed to the Advaita system of thought. Itis also important to notice, as Halbfass points out, that, in spite of his use of Nyāyalogic, Śańkara dismisses reasoning and other philosophical schools, asserting unequivocally that realisation of truth can only come from *Vedāntavākyas*[^95]. At the sametime Śańkara does not criticize Nyāya separately from Vaiśeṣika by name, as he doesin the case of Yoga and Sāńkhya, even though he opposes the Vaiśeṣika theory ofatoms, *samavāya* and its belief in Īśvara as the efficient cause of the world[^96].

[^94]: "Cf. BSBH, I.1.19 and 1.2.8."

[^95]: "Halbfass, op. cit., pp. 146-47."

 One cannot give much credit to Hacker's theory that Śańkara started out as a *yogī*and then changed over to Advaita later in his life. Firstly Śańkara need not disownYoga in order to be an *advaitin*, as the Yoga methodology is well integrated into theVedānta path to Brahman-realisation. Śańkara in the BSBH freely uses many yogicterms and quotes the YS in the BSBH, but he nowhere accepts its ontology and doesnot mince words in saying so.

 The fact that Śańkara writes vehemently criticising the Yoga school by name withoutsubsuming it under Sāńkhyaas he does in some places, cannot be overlooked andproves a stumbling block for establishing the identity of the BSBHK with the VK[^97].

Hacker's conversion theory need not be taken seriously. H. Nakamura while attributing the YSBHV to Śaṅkara does not subscribe to the conversion hypothesis[^98].Moreover Hacker's assumption that the *Māṇḍūkya-Upaniṣad-Kārikābhāṣya* (MUKBH) isthe first Advaita work of Śaṅkara is also not easy to prove. So the conversion theorywill have to be set aside as it has no concrete evidence to support it.

[^98]: "Mayeda, op. cit., p. 8, n. 15"

 Fritz Staal responding to my papers in the JIP issues (see Appendixes I and II to vol. II of the present work) in the same journal (JIP, March 1995) has again supportedHacker's conversion theory; I would again reiterate that this has no basis whatsoever. Staal also makes a second assumption to fit the conversion hypothesis, that Śaṅkaraneed not have died so young as traditional accounts have it; this would make it possible, in Staal's calculation, for Śaṅkara to get over his first fascination which wasYoga and then "Later, perhaps much later (for there is no hard evidence to supportthe tradition that he died young), he may have changed his mind and returned tosomething more traditional: the Upaniṣads.[^99], vol. 23, 1995, pp. 53-55.")"Much as I would like to fall into thisfanciful picture of Śaṅkara,I do hope that Staal will be convinced about its folly oncehe reads through this Introduction to the end.I would, however, make one more pointbefore going on to other matter. Whatever other doubts there may be regarding theworks and other incidents in Śaṅkara's life, tradition has been consistent regardingthe early death of Śaṅkara. Considering that Śaṅkara went on foot twice throughoutthe land and lived a *saṃnyāsin's* rigorous life of sacrifice, it is reasonable to assumethat he did die young, particularly when one remembers that life expectancy was notvery high all over the globe and also in India till very recent times. So one has toaccept tradition as far as this question is concerned. Unless there is some objectivebasis "confirming or disconfirming the tradition" it cannot be rejected outright. "Iftradition were to be rejected outright and *a priori*, further discussion would be futile.Even scepticism has to be reasoned[^100]."

[^99]: "Journal of Indian Philosophy (JIP

[^100]: "Pande, op. cit., P. 122."

 One other scholar who has discussed the authorship identity question recently isG.C. Pande who has argued about the unlikelihood of Śaṅkara being the author of theYSBHV. I was surprised to see that Pande's and my arguments agree in a number ofways though we did not communicate with each other nor was there any mutualknowledge of each other's work[^101]. The nāndīverses at the beginning of the YSBHV,the blatant self-praise in one of the concluding verses, a number of verses at the end and many more un-Śaṅkara characteristics are the common points mentioned by bothof us; there are points on which we differ as well. Pande judges the benedictoryverses of the YSBHV and the concluding verses not as bad as the benedictory verses in the MUKBH. He also does not maintain his scepticism to the end and eventuallycapitulates to concede that the YSBHV could have been a work of Śaṅkara[^87].But howdoes one reconcile that conclusion with the comment that Pande makes almost immediately that the "general style of the *Vivaraṇa* is, however, not characteristic ofmature Śaṅkara.[^83]" It thus seems that while Pande concedes the identity of the two

[^83]: "Ibid."

[^87]: "Pande, op. cit., p. 112."

[^101]: "Ibid., pp. 111-12, 310-13, 326; Rukmani, JIP article, see Appendixes I and II in vol. II of presentwork."





Śaṅkaras he is not entirely convinced of it. The point that Pande has not noted is the nature of Śaṅkara's works. An important feature of Śaṅkara's writings which Pande has not mentioned is that they are all original compositions. The MUKBH, is the only exception but that has again not been proven to be Śaṅkara's work conclusively. The independent, confident style of Śaṅkara indicates a strong personality, and the choice of original works on which he wrote commentaries appears to fit into the character of the BSBHK, who would like to state what he has to say under a sūtra rather than try to reinterpret the *bhāṣya* of another person. (Cf. Appendix I in vol. II of this work.)

 The YSBHV then is certainly by one Śaṅkara who could be either a member of the Payyūr family, or of Śaṅkarārya, a fourteenth century author, as suggested by Gopinath Kaviraj[^104].Kaviraj also attributes the many *Jayamaṅgalas* to this author. Nampoothiry in his *Sanskrit Literature of Kerala* lists one Śaṅkarārya belonging to the fifteenth century who is the author of *Sarvapratyayumāla* (a Vyakaraṇa work) and who also wrote the *Vedāntasāra*, also called the *Sarvasiddhāntasaṅgraha*, a Vedanta work[^105].K.K. Raja also mentions a Śańkarārya as the author of the *Sarvapratyayamālā*[^106]and the *Sarvasiddhāntasaṅgraha*[^107]. There are many Śaṅkaras mentioned by Nampoothiry besides Śaṅkarārya. There is one Śaṅkaranārāyaṇa of the ninth century CE[^108]author of a commentary on the *Laghubhāskarīya* of Bhāskara called the *Vivaraṇa* (mentioned earlier in the Introduction) and also another work called *Bṛhatīkarmanibaddha*[^109]. Any one of these Śaṅkaras could have been the author of the YSBHV.

THE VIVARAṆA AND THE BRAHMASŪTRABHĀṢYA

 In the course of my detailed reading of the YSBHV a number of points which are certainly uncharacteristic of the style of the BSBHK, have struck me. While this cannot be exhaustively dealt with here, I shall mention some of them below.

 In general the BSBHK uses *Sugata* for the Buddha and *Saugata* for Buddhist ideas[^110]. In this he seems to be following the *Amarakośa* which has *sugato* as a synonym of Buddha[^111]. The BSBHK also avoids the use of the proper names Buddha, etc.. and the epithet *arhat*. The VK has no hesitation in using these proper names whenever there is an occasion[^112].

[^110]: "Cf. BSBH, II.2.19, 20, 24, 28, 32, 33, 36; and UPA. I.18.35. In the Introduction to II.2.28 though Śaṅkara has vijñānavādī bauddha not commonly used by him."

[^111]: "Amarakośa, 25-sugato buddho dharmarājastathāgataḥ."

[^112]: "Cf. YSBHV, pp. 30, 71, 72 and notes in the body of the work."

 There is an interesting interlude under YS, I.27 in the YSBHV[^113]. Stating that Īśvara is denoted by the word *praṇava* the VK tries to explain it grammatically in terms of its connection with Īśvara. He gives a number of derivations for the word; he also splits *praṇava* and gives alternative meanings for the ending *ava*; he also bends backwards to explain why *Om* cannot be declined. The BSBHK on the other hand, has not in any of the Upaniṣads he has commented on, or in the BSBH, tried to explain the

[^113]: "Cf. YSBHV, P. 76."



word *praṇava* etymologically. Under sūtras BS, III.3.63-66 where a discussion takes place between the pūrvapakṣin and the siddhāntin the word *praṇava* isused in the sense of *Om* and there is no suggestion of its being different from *Om*,leave alone trying to explain its derivation. It is also interesting to observe that it isonly the *Muṇdakopaniṣad* (amongst the so-called early Upaniṣads) that uses *praṇava*as a synonym for *Om* for the first time[^114]. Śaṅkara while explaining it just equates it to*Om*[^115].He does the same when commenting on Gītā, VII.8.[^116]

[^114]: "Mund. Up., II.2.4."

[^115]: "Śankara's commentary on the above-praṇava omkāro dhanuḥ."

 In the YSBHV we get a quotation from the*Subāla Upaniṣad*(SU)[^117] (SU)which is not anUpaniṣad ever quoted by the BSBHK either in the BSBH or in his commentaries onthe ten Upaniṣads generally considered as genuine.[^118] It will thus be difficult to believethat the BSBHK would make a departure from his set practice when he wrote theYSBHV. It is more reasonable to conclude that he did not write the YSBHV. The SUdoes not even figure in the exhaustive lists that Belvalkar and Ranade prepared[^119] andwe will have to assign it to a later period. The contents of the SU set in the format ofa dialogue, has a number of borrowings from many Vedic and other sources and alsoindicates the same conclusion[^120]."

[^116]: "praṇava omkāraḥ sarvavedeṣu, tasmin praṇavabhūte mayi sarve vedāḥ protāḥ."

[^117]: "YSBHV, p. 76."

[^118]: "Pande, op. cit., pp. 107-8."

[^119]: "S.K. Belvalkar and R.D. Ranade, History of Indian Philosophy, vol. 2, pp. 87, 90-135."

[^120]: "asad vā idam agra āsīt, ajātam, abhūtam, apratiṣṭham, aśabdam, asparśam, arūpam, arasam, agandham,avyayam, amahāntam, abṛhantam, ajam, ātmānam matvā dhīro na socati... -SU, III."

 The VK makes a specific mention to the six-limbed Yoga[^121]under YS, II.29 whichlooks as if he is referring to the *Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad,* in which there is the enumeration of the six limbs of Yoga[^122].Since he justifies the non-mention of *yama* and *niyama*in the enumeration[^123] but does not mention anything about the absence of *āsana* hemay also be referring to another system as well. The BSBHK refers pointedly to*yama* and *niyama* in the BSBH and he does not legitimate this six-limbed Yoga evenif he was aware of it.[^124]

[^121]: "YSBHV, p. 211."

[^122]: "Mait. Up., VI.18. . . ṣaḍṅagā iti ucyate yogaḥ. yama, niyama and āsana are not in this list; the sixangas are prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra, dhyāna, dhāraṇā, tarkaḥ, samādhiḥ."

[^123]: "kiñca—sākṣādāsanādīnyeva samādherupakurvanti, na yamaniyamau. naiṣa doṣah. yamaniyamavatoryogādhikāropapatteḥ. . .-YSBHV, p. 211."

 The VK's specific reference to the different concepts of *mokṣa* in Sāṅhya andYoga (cf. earlier in Introduction) as well as to technical Naiyāyika concepts like*pakṣadharmatva[^125],**anuvyavasāya*[^126],*indriyārthasannikarṣa pratyakṣa*[^127], etc., cannotbe reconciled with the late interest in serious scholarly studies in Nyāya and otherschools of thought in Kerala, as already mentioned. These schools were yet to betaken up for study in Kerala in the post-Śaṅkara era, which is the general consensusof scholars who have worked in the area of Sanskrit literature in Kerala.

[^124]: "Cf. BSBH, III.3.28."

[^125]: "Cf. YSBHV, p. 67."

[^126]: "Cf. YSBHV, P. 303."

[^127]: "Cf. YSBHV, pp. 6-7, 23."

Śaṅkara the BSBHK refutes the doctrines of the schools that admit Īśvara as anefficient cause only, and under that he lists the *Māheśvara-s* as well.[^128]Glossing on

[^128]: "BSBH, II.2.37."



*Māheśvara-s*, Miśra lists four major sects i.e., the Śaivas,Pāśupatas,Kāruṇikasiddhāntins,and the Kāpālikas[^129].Neither the BSBHK nor Miśra mentions the Kaulasin this connection. But the VK not only refers to the Kaulas but also talks about theirpreferences[^130].

[^129]: "Bhāmatī on the bhāṣya under BS, II.2.37."

[^130]: "Cf. YSBHV, p. 342"

 The BSBHK, was certainly familiar with Āyurveda and its practices[^131]. But the VKhas some references to Āyurveda such as *Vṛkṣāyurveda* which are not found in theBSBH[^132]. He also refers to Āyurveda in connection with the discussion of shadowsbeing sweet and cool in the context of the Īśvarakāraṇavāda, though the discussion isin no way relevant[^133] cikistāśāstre chāyā madhurasītaletyucyate... (2) madhuratvam, śītalatvam, dāhaśramaharatvañca iti rājanirghaṇṭaḥ, Deb, Śabdaka!padruma, vol.II,P. 490."). The VK shows interest in the theory of alchemy of Āyurvedawhich is not evident in the BSBHK[^134]. The different views on *kaivalya* or *mokṣa* underYS, IV.33 in the YSBHV, makes interesting reading[^135]. The VK is clearly referring tothe Buddhist, Nyāya, Śaiva and Bhāgavata schools here.⁸ It is however, surprising tonotice that the Advaita concept does not form part of this group.

[^131]: "BSBH, I.2.17, III. 1.2."

[^132]: "YSBHV, p. 145."

[^133]: "YSBHV, p. 70. (1

[^134]: "YSBHV, 60... bhaiṣajyarasāyanādyanuṣṭhānavat."

[^135]: "YSBHV, p. 368"

 Under III.28 the VK comes up with astrological ideas connecting living beingswith the movement of planets. He thus says that there is knowledge of the oppositionand victory between different planets and connects them to the rise of good and badeffects on living beings.⁹The BSBHK does not indulge in such a style in the BSBHeven if he knew of the connections.

**REFERENCES TO VĀCASPATI MIŚRA IN THE VIVARAṆA**

 I have reserved the last section of the Introduction to some explicit references toMiśra's statements in the YSBHV. When I first came across them it was difficult tobelieve these allusions to the words of Miśra staring one in the face. I have read themagain and again and have no more hesitation to state that the following references aredefinitely alluding to Miśra's writings in the *Tattvavaiśāradī*(TV) and therefore theVK is to be placed later than at least a century after the time of Miśra. He can in noway be identified with the BSBHK.

 To begin with, in the introduction itself under YS, I. 1, the VK discusses the statesof the mind mentioned in the bhāṣya as *kṣiptum*, *mūḍham*, etc., in the context of theoverall comment that samādhi is the characteristic of all the states of the mind. This,as is well-known, is one of the problems of the definition of samadhi itself and has

exercised the minds of all the commentators of the YS. But we cannot go into thathere. The VK explains the word samādhi as *sthiti* (staying in) or as being in thatstate' called variously as *kṣipta, mūḍha*, etc., for the time that it lasts. Thus, as thesedefine the states themselves 'staying in those states' is samādhi or *sthiti* and that is thecommon samādhi for all those states.¹In other words, just as a man walking stops ateach step (*sthiti)* but is still walking, so also all the states like *kṣipta, mūḍha*, etc., donot qualify as samādhi though they stay in those states momentarily. Of course this isnot what the bhāṣya says but that is a different matter. Now comes the reference toMiśra. In this context of the definition, the VK states—others (*anye*) say the stagesare external and internal objects of *saṃ̣̣yama*. But they cannot then explain the nextline vikṣiptecetasi. .[^136]Now who is this *anye*? When we look at the TV we see thathe is indeed saying what the VK has referred to. While discussing the stages, Miśradismisses the *kşipta* and the *mūḍha* states. But he concedes that *vikṣipta* can haveoccasional stability and that is why only the *vikṣipta* has been taken up for denial bythe bhāṣya.³Continuing on the same lines under sūtra 1.2 the TV echoes what the VKcriticizes. Here Miśra firstly states what the VK implies and talks about the restlessand other stages as states of samādhi. In the *vikṣipta* state Miśra says that the *sattvapradhāna* mind wants to meditate on reality and does meditate on atomisation andsuch *siddhis (aiśvarya)* thinking that to be reality. It stays in it for a moment and thenloses it, overcome by *rajas*.⁴Thus the states of the mind being known with referenceto the object of *saṃ̣̣yama*, which the VK refers to, is an allusion to the TV comment.Since Bhoja does not comment on this aspect at all and Bhikṣu is later than the VK itis certain that the VK is referring to Miśra hereby the use of the word *anye*.

 In the second instance under YS, 1.24 the VK says that the word *nimitta* is explained as testimony by others and uses the word *anyeṣām* to refer to the others[^137]. Theeditors of this YSBHV themselves state that *anyeṣām* refers to Miśra in their footnote[^138]; but as they have attributed the authorship of the YSBHV to the BSBHK theygive an alternate explanation for *anye* as others who have set the example for Miśra to follow.[^139] This is totally misleading and unnecessary. It is wrong to find a fancifulmeaning when the direct meaning stares one in the face[^140]. Thus again the VK is refer..

 In the Sādhanapāda under YS, II.7 the VK points out a different reading that "others" have for the sūtras II.6 and II.7 and refers to "others" by the word *anyeṣām*[^141].He mentions the variant readings as *sukhānuśayī*and *duḥkhānuśayī*; he even goes further and states how they (*anye)* mention the two sūtras as *sukhānuśayī* *rāgaḥ* and *duḥkhānuśayi dveṣaḥ[^142]*.This, as is well-known, is what Miśra and following him all others, after Miśra, generally have as their sūtra readings[^143].It is significant that the VK uses the word *anyeṣām* for Miśra here as well. We can now safely surmise that he reserves the word *anya* and its various forms for Miśra.

[^141]: "sukhānuśayī tathā duḥkhānuśayīti anyeṣām pāṭhaḥ-YSBHV, p. 139."

[^142]: "Ibid"

[^143]: "sukhānuśayī rāgaḥ-TV; duḥkhānuśayī dveṣaḥ-TV; Bhoja, Bhikṣu, Āraṇyaka all follow this reading"

 The above variant readings of YS, 6 and 7 mentioned by the VK have been noticed by others as well, but the full significance of that has somehow been missed. Halbfass, for instance, passes them over as another example of not having a 'well established' *Yogabhāṣya* text and TV text[^144]. But it could indeed be the reverse. The TV by and large, is fairly well established and so is the bhāṣya text followed by Miśra. So if the VK so explicitly refers to these readings he must be referring to Miśra himself, especially since he again refers to him by the term *anyeṣām*. And when the VK goes on to say "he will later mention that pleasure comes from dharma and from pleasure attachment[^145]" in the same place, he is referring to the bhāṣya reading of Miśra under YS, IV.11. If he had the variant sūtra readings which Miśra's TV has today, it is not unreasonable to assume that the VK is continuing to refer to the bhāṣya reading which comes later in Miśra's TV[^146]. The VK definitely had access to these readings as we can surmise from his writing about them. In fact, he is only using these later references to reinforce his definition of attachment and hatred following experience of pleasure and pain; he first points out that his readings are in conformity with the meanings of Miśra's texts and then further strengthens it by referring to the bhāṣya reading under IV.11. So there is no need to find the same reading in the YSBHV and in the TV in order to believe that the VK is referring to Miśra's versions of the sūtra text under II.6 and II.7. The VK adopts this style of referring to the bhāṣya and sūtra readings in other places as well like YS, II.15 and II.24 (for more details see Vivaraṇa under those sūtras). This again argues for the presence of a standard bhāṣya text by the time of the VK.

[^144]: "Halbfass, op. cit., P. 208"

[^145]: "tathā ca vakṣyati—dharmātsukham sukhādrāgaḥ iti—YSBHV, p. 139"

[^146]: "heturdharmātsukhamadharmādduḥkham sukhādrāgo duḥkhāddveṣo-VBH on YS, IV.11."

 In the same pāda under YS, II.50 the VK again refers to *anye* in the context of having a different interpretation for the words *pūraka* and recaka. This reference, in my opinion, proves beyond a shadow of doubt that the VK is talking about Miśra. Let us follow the VK closely. According to the VK the function of taking in the external air is called *bāhyavṛttiḥ* i.e., the VK understands the inhalation of outside air as external activity[^147]. Now comes the crucial statement when the VK adds immediately in the next line that, others (*anye*) mention that as *pūraka*[^148]. This is exactly what Miśra and

[^147]: "bāhyasya vāyorantaḥ praveśanam prativṛttiḥ yasya sa bāhyavṛītiḥ, tasmāt sa bāhyaḥ—YSBHV, p. 227"

[^148]: "bāhyamanye püraka ityācakṣate-YSBHV, p. 227."





others after him, call it, following the bhāṣya-when there is absence of flow of airafter inhalation that is pūraka[^149].Miśra supplies the word *pūraka* and the word *recaka*which the bhāṣya does not have[^150].Continuing the same discussion on the same lines,the VK says that the exhalation of internal air is an internal activity[^151].And he immediately states that'it is called *recaka'*[^152](by others is understood from the earlier mention of *pūraka* by others). According to Miśra i.e., when there is absence of flow of airafter exhalation that is called *recaka*[^153]-TV, under VBH, II.50."). Miśra makes his understanding of *pūraka* and*recaka* clear when he says further down-there is no inhalation so it is not *pūraka*;there is no exhalation so it is not *recaka*[^154]. It is therefore very clear that the VK isindeed quoting Miśra and referring to him by the term *anye* as he has been consistently doing throughout the YSBHV.[^155]This, incidentally, can also indicate that there was a standard *Yogabhāṣya* and TV text by this time.

[^149]: "yatra śvāsapūrvako gatyabhāvaḥ sa ābhyantaraḥ—VBH, under YS, II. 50."

[^150]: "recakamaha-yatra praśvāseti ... ; pūrakamāha-yatra śvāseti ...-TV, under VBH, II.50."

[^151]: "ābhyantarasya vāyorbahimissāraṇam prativṛttiryasya sa ābhyantavṛttiḥ tasmāt sa ābhyantaraḥ YSBHV, p. 228."

[^152]: "tam recaka ityācakṣate-YSBHV, p. 228."

[^153]: "recakamāha-yatra praśvāsa (pūrvako gatyabhāvaḥ sa bāhyaḥ

[^154]: "na tu pūrayati yena pūrakaḥ, na tu recayati yena recaka iti-ibid."

[^155]: "Leggett simply misses the significance of this cross reference-cf. Leggett, op. cit., p. 24."

 In the Vibhūtipāda under sūtra III.6 the VK again refers to another by the word*anyeşām.* The discussion is whether or not the *yogī*can practise *saṃyama* on thehigher stages without conquering the lower ones. The VK is of the opinion that thelower stages must be conquered before progressing to the higher states. And then hesays "others say that by attaining the later stage of self-realization the earlier stages ofknowing another's mind, etc., has been [accomplished](#)." The VK disagrees with thisinterpretation of the bhāṣya by Miśra. In the TV Miśra maintains, as mentioned bythe VK, that once the higher stage of self-realization is attained (he adds through thegrace of īśvara) there is the accomplishment of the lower siddhi-s like *paracittajñāna,*etc[^156] uttarabhūmi-vijayasya pratyāsannasyānyata eveśvarapraṇidhānādevāvagatatvāt-TV, under VBH, III.6."). But the VK has a different interpretation for which the relevant portion underIII.6 in the body of the work can be consulted. So again we see that the VK refers toMiśra by the word *anyeṣām.*

[^156]: ".. tadarthasya (the VK has arthasya though earlier he mentions it as tadarthasya

 There are striking similarities in style and language in some places between theTV and the YSBHV. Even though one need not read too much into these similarities,given the fact that the VK was familiar with the TV (as shown above), these are significant.

 In sūtra II.27 the word *saptadhã* (of seven kinds) has been connected to the yogī's*prajñā* by some commentators[^157]and to *prajñā* by others[^158].We find that the VK agrees with Miśra in referring it to the *yogī.*[^159]

[^157]: "Miśra, Bhoja, Āraṇyaka."

[^158]: "Bhikṣu."

 The TV and the YSBHV begin their respective commentaries on YSBH, III.17 in exactly the same words[^160]. Even the substitution of just one word (*anyaḥ* for *aparaḥ)*

[^159]: "YSBHV, p. 205"

[^160]: "ayamaparaḥ samyamasya viṣaya upakṣipyate...-TV; ayamanyaḥ samyamavişayaḥ upakṣipyate ...-YSBHV, p. 263."



seems to be a deliberate effort. This similarity of style is also seen in the commencement of the TV and YSBHV under YSBH, III.44[^161].

[^161]: "sthūlam ca svarūpam ca sūkṣam cānvayaścārthavattvam ceti sthūlasvarūpasūkṣmānvayārthavattvāni—TV; sthūlam ca svarūpam ca sūkṣam cānvayaścārthavattvam ceti-YSBHV, p. 297."

 It is now very clear that the VK was not only familiar with the TV, but also studiedit with care before writing his YSBHV. He has differed with him in some places inthe Samādhipāda, in the Sādhanapāda and in the Vibhūtipāda. He obviously was ingeneral agreement with Miśra's understanding of the Kaivalyapāda. It is certain thatthe *bhāṣya* readings were not always the same in front of Miśra and the VK. But itdoes seem that after Miśra's time the text got standardised though there are minorvariations as is evidenced in the *Bhojavṛtti* and in the *Yogavārttika* (YV) of Bhikṣu.The VK has great respect for Miśra as in all the above references he addresses him inthe plural *(anye, anyeṣām)*. All this indicates that the VK must be placed at least acentury or two after Miśra. Under the circumstances it is thus not possible for VācaspatiMiśra to give any indication of 'this supposedly older commentary on the same text'as Halbfass says[^162], as he lived much before the VK, who has used his TV in his YSBHV.

[^162]: "Halbfass.op.cit.,p.208"

VIVARAṆA AND THE YOGAVĀRTTIKA OF VIJÑĀNABHIKṢU

 Before the conclusion it will be worthwhile to see if any Yoga commentator after the VK has referred to him or not. One important point to note in this connection is thatMiśra's reputation as a commentator of the philosophical systems ensured referenceto him more often than to the others, even when such works were known. There havebeen cases of authors quoting from their preferred texts even when other texts on thesame material were available. One is reminded of Rāmānuja's ignoring the *BhāgavataPurāṇa* in preference to the *Viṣnu Purāṇa* in this context. So while one need notattach too much importance to the non-mention of a particular text when similar textsdealing with the same school are available, when one does come across some reference it is indeed reassuring.

 Bhikṣu perhaps is the most important Yoga commentator on the *Yogabhāṣya* afterthe VK. Bhikṣu refers to and criticizes Miśra in a number of places[^163].There is onespecific reference by name to the YSBHV by Bhikṣu in the YV under YS, III.39.4[^164].Bhikṣu refutes Miśra's understanding of the five *prāṇas* as functions of the five kindsand agrees with the interpretation of the YSBHV in this context. Thus he says thatMiśra contradicts the statement of *prāṇa*-movement in the Vivaraṇa commentary;along with that he adds that it is proper to understand the same meaning as given inthe Vedānta and in the *Sānkhyakārikā* (SK)⁵. This is significant as Śaṅkara the BSBHKis supportive of what the VK says regarding *prāṇa*[^165] and so is the SK[^166].So by speciallymentioning the three as separate works, Bhikṣu shows that he is indeed familiar with

[^163]: "T.S. Rukmani, op. cit., vols. I-IV in many places."

[^164]: "Ibid., vol. III, p. 150, n. 7-the words 'the commentary of Padmapāda' must be deleted to read 'usesthe YSBHV'."

[^165]: "...iha tu śravaṇādyavāntaravyāpāropetāḥ prāṇā na sambhūya prāṇyuriti yuktam-BSBH, II.4.9."

[^166]: "...sāmānyakaraṇavṛttiḥ prāṇādyā vāyavaḥ pañca-SK, 29."

all the three, while making it clear that the three are by different authors. The defintion of the movement of *prāṇa* in the three texts do indeed support each other.

 Bhikṣu seems to follow the YSBHV in some of his ideas. For instance Bhikṣu andthe VK consider the portion *yasya cittasya avasthitasya* *idam śāstreṇa parikarmanirdiśyate tatkatham* as part of the bhāṣya under YS, 1.32 as against Miśra and others.Again both Bhikṣu and the VK take the collection of sutras beginning with 1.33, asalternative means for steadying the mind. Miśra, on the other hand, does not includeYS,I.33 in that group. Bhikṣu and the VK also talk about the distinction betweensamādhi as means and samādhi

as end while Miśra does not bother about it. (cf.Appendix II to vol. II of the present work). In the understanding of the meaning of the technical word *samāpatti*

introduced in YS, I.41 by Patañjali, both the VK and Bhikṣuagree in understanding *samāpatti*

as referring to the result of samadhi.**¹**

Miśra,on theother hand,just takes it to be a synonym of *samprajñāta*[^167]

.Bhikṣu's reading of*vartamānasya*

[^167]: "sa samāpattiḥ samprajñātalakṣaṇo yogaḥ ucyate—TV, under VBH, 1.41."

in place of *atītasya*

in the bhāṣya under III.14 (which is in agreementwith the VK's understanding) has already been pointed out. Bhikṣu and the VK havea similar understanding of *ekabhavika*

under VBH, II. 13 and they also have the samereading of the bhāṣya[^168]

.

[^168]: "Cf. Halbfass, op. cit., pp. 209, 232, n. 20; Cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. II, p. 55 and nn. 1-5."

 Bhikṣu appears to be familiar with the discussion in the YSBHV pertaining tocreated bodies (*nirmāṇa-śarīras*) and whether these bodies have many minds and*jīvas* individually. While the VK only mentions the various views without committing himself to any one opinion, Bhikṣu carries the discussion further and gives hisview as well[^169].

[^169]: "YSBHV, p. 320; Rukmani, op. cit., vol. IV, PP.11-13."

 While Miśra's works had an all India appeal the same cannot be said to be the casefor works from Kerala. The YSBHV had only a limited appeal and Bhikṣu used itsparingly. He was more concerned with refuting Miśra's views in the TV to which herefers a number of times. Thus we can say, from Bhikṣu's reference by name to theYSBHV that he knew the work but did not use it as much as the TV because of thepopularity that the TV enjoyed.

CONCLUSION

 I have tried to examine the question of the identity of the author of the Vivaraṇaafresh in the foregoing pages. Since a line by line translation of the YSBHV wasdone,it gave me an opportunity to pay attention minately to what was written in theYSBHV and its references to other works as well.I am now confident, after thisexhaustive study, that the author is certainly not the BSBHK Śaṅakara, whicheverother Śaṅkara he might be. It is also certain that he must have lived not later than thefifteenth century of the Common Era because some of its contents find a place in the*Gopālikā* of Parameśvara II, who lived at that time. The partiality of the VK to themethodology of Nyāya argumentation also points to a date much later than that of

Udayana. This style of writing and the familiarity of the VK with the technicalities of Nyāya, Sāṅkhya and Yoga ideas in the Kerala region which, till at leastthethirteenthcentury was preoccupied with Pūrva and Uttaramīmāmsā, also argues for a late date.Gelblum supports this by giving his own reason for placing the VK later than, notonly Miśra, but also Bhoja[^170].The popularity of Miśra in Kerala is attested to by thecommentaries written on the *Nyāyakaṇikā* and *Tattvabindu* by the Payyūr Bhaṭṭas inthe fifteenth century and argues for its regular study at least a century or two beforethat. Thus a Śaṅkara, anywhere between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries couldhave written the Vivaraṇa, influenced by Vācaspati Miśra whom he definitely admired. As a work on Yoga it is an important contribution to Yoga studies and alsoreveals some information about the Kerala scene. Unlike what some say the VK isnot an immature writer and he needs to be read with care. Of course he has a tendencyto be pompous and pedantic but so did Daṇḍin, Subandhu and others in the literaryfield. Its large number of variant readings (also noted by others who worked on it)can be invaluable for reconstructing a standard sūtra and bhāṣya text.

**समाधिपादः**

**Samādhipādaḥ**

अथ योगानुशासनम्॥१॥

 Now an exposition of Yoga ( is begun).

 The word, *atha* (now), is in the sense of beginning. It should be understood thatthe authoritative book which explains yoga is begun. Yoga is samādhi; and that is aquality of the mind which belongs to all (its) stages. The stages of the mind are the restless, the infatuated, the distracted, the one-pointed and the restricted. Of these, inthe distracted state of mind the samādhi, being subordinated by distractions, cannotbe included in yoga. In the one-pointed mind, when there is illumination of the objectas it really is, when there is weakening of the afflictions, when there is loosening ofthe bonds of *karma*, and when its goal is the restriction (of all modifications of themind) that is known as *samprajñāta* yoga. This will be explained later as accompanied by *vitarka*, by *vicāra*, by *ānanda* (and) by *asmitā*.

 I bow down to him who is the guru (preceptor) even of the gurus. He who isomniscient, who is all-powerful (who has all the siddhis), who is free from the fruit ofaction which is full of defects, (and) who is the Lord who is the cause of the rise,sustenance and destruction of the universe.

 The Vivaraṇa on the Pātañjala Yogasūtrabhāṣya (Yoga philosophy) which commences with the words *atha* and so on, is begun[^172]. In that context, without the mention of the connection (between the text and the topic being discussed therein) and thepurpose (of the study of the text ) it is not possible to attain (reach) the end eitherthrough activity or detachment of a person (puruṣa); therefore, at the outset, the connection and purpose which are the reasons for the activity of a person (puruṣa) andwhich are intended by the (Sūtrakāra Patañjali) are being mentioned.

 As for the purpose (of the study of Yoga philosophy) it has been explained through indicating the fourfold character of the science of medicine. Thus, the science ofmedicine has a fourfold character like disease, the cause of disease, good health, andthe cure (medical treatment); and this fourfold division has to be explained throughthe rules of injunctions and prohibitions. In a similar way, here also, beginning withthe sūtra *pariṇāmatāpasaṁskāraduḥkhairguṇavṛttivirodhācca* *duḥkhameva* *sarvam**vivekinaḥ*[^173] in the end, because of anguish, because ofsubliminal-impressions and because of the contrary nature of the guņas, to the discriminating, all is pain."),the fourfold nature of this philosophy is indicated.Thus—

[^173]: "YS, II.15. Because of the pains (of causing suffering

the world whichhas an abundance of pain is to be abandoned; its cause is the contact between the seerand the seen which is due to ignorance (avidyā); the means of cessation (of the pain)is continuous (unbroken) discriminate-discernment; when there is discriminate-discernment there is the disappearance of 'avidyā'; when 'avidyā' has disappeared thereis the total cessation of the contact between the seer and the seen which is cessation(of pain) and that is itself 'kaivalya'.As 'kaivalya' is mentioned in the place of goodhealth (in the previous example of medicinal science) this 'kaivalya' is the end (purpose) of this philosophy.

 ननु च हेयतद्धेतू न प्रस्तोतव्ये,निष्प्रयोजनत्वात्।हानप्रयुक्तं हि शास्त्रं,तदुपायभूता विवेकख्यातिरेव वक्तव्या।न हि कण्टकविद्धचरणतलस्य तदपनयनं मुक्त्वा दुःखतद्धेतू चोद्येते ।








 Objection-But then, that which is to be abandoned and its cause are not to bementioned since they serve no useful purpose. Philosophy is to be used for the sake ofcessation (of pain); therefore the means to that which is discriminate-discernment isalone to be mentioned. If the foot (sole of the foot) is hurt ( pierced) by a thorn, onedoes not question the pain and the cause for it, giving up the removal of the thorn.  

 नैतदेवं— हेयतत्कारणोपेक्षत्वाद्धानोपायस्य। यावदिदमनेनोपायेन हातव्यं संसारचक्रम् अस्य चाविद्यानिमित्तोद्रष्टृदृश्यसंयोगो हेतुः इति नाख्यायते, तावन्नाविद्याप्रतिपक्षभूता विवेकख्यातिराख्यातुं शक्यते।हेयतद्धेतुमतोहानोपायार्थिनो रोगिणो भैषज्यार्थित्वदर्शनात्।न हि रोगं रोगहेतुं चानपेक्ष्य चिकित्साशास्त्रमुपदिश्यते॥

 Answer—But this is not like that. The means for cessation (of pain) are dependent on that which is to be abandoned and on its cause. Till such time as it is not mentioned that this cycle of births and deaths (the world) is to be got rid of by such and suchmeans and also that this (world) is caused by 'avidyā (ignorance) which is due to thecontact between the seer and the seen, it is not possible to describe discriminate-discernment which is the opposer to 'avidyā'. The request for medicine in one who issick and who is seeking a cure (for it) is seen accompanied by the knowledge of therelationship between the disease (that is to be got rid of) and its cause. The science ofmedicine does not advise (a cure) without paying attention to the disease and thecause of the disease.

 सम्बन्धोऽपि—विवेकख्यातेर्हानमेव फलं साध्यं हानस्यापि विवेकख्यातिरेव साधनमिति साध्यसाधनयोरितरेतरनियम एव, नान्यसंबन्धः तद्यथा— भैषज्यस्यारोग्यमेव फलम् आरोग्यस्यापि भैषज्यमेवसाधनमिति इतरेतरनियमः, स च शास्त्रादिति।तस्मात् ससंबन्धप्रयोजनं योगानुशासनम्।

 As for the relationship (between the philosophy and the topic being discussed) it is that discriminate-discernment has the cessation (of pain), which is to be achieved, asits result; and of this cessation, discriminate-discernment alone is the means; thus therule is that of the mutual relationship between that to be achieved and its means andnot any other relationship. Thus the result of medical treatment is good health and forgood health, the means is also medical treatment; thus there is the rule of mutualrelationship and this is to be learnt from the philosophy (of Yoga). Therefore theinstruction in Yoga philosophy is (being done ), ( mentioning) along with it the purpose to be achieved and the relationship it has with it.

 ननु च यदि हानं प्रयोजनं तदुपायश्च विवेकख्यातिरिति, तत्र वक्तव्यम् 'अथ विवेकख्यात्यनुशासनम्' इति।किमर्थम् 'अथ योगानुशासनम्' इति सूत्रितम् ?

 Objection—But then, if cessation of pain is the end ( purpose ) and its means isdiscriminate-discernment, it should have been stated as 'Now discriminate-discernment is begun'.Why is the sūtra stated as 'Now Yoga is begun'.

 तदुपायत्वाद्योगस्य। उपाय एव वक्तव्यः स्यात्।उपेयोपप्रदर्शने हि उपेयमुपायं प्रति साकाङ्क्षमेवेत्युपायःसाङ्गकलापः पुनरपि वक्तव्यः स्यात्।तस्मिंश्चाभिहिते सर्वमभिहितमिति ।

 Answer—Because it (discriminate-discernment) is a means to yoga (and) only themeans is to be mentioned (taught). When the end is to be discussed (it is known that)that which is the end is the desired result (expectation) of that which is the means;



therefore the means has to be taught again, along with all its parts[^174].And when that isexplained (taught) (then) everything is explained.

[^174]: "Thus discriminate-discernment will, in any case, be discussed."

 कथं तदुपायत्वम्?यत आह सूत्रकारः—'योगाङ्गानुष्ठानादशुद्धिक्षये ज्ञानदीप्तिराविवेकख्यातेः' इति।'निर्विचारवैशारद्येऽध्यात्मप्रसादः' 'ऋतंभरा तत्र प्रज्ञा' इति च।तथा भाष्यकारोऽप्याह—'यस्त्वेकाग्रे चेतसिस भूतमर्थं प्रद्योतयति' इति।भूतार्थावगतिश्च विवेकख्यातिः।तस्माद्युक्तं तदुपाययोगानुशासनमेवादौ सूत्रितमिति॥

 How is that yoga the means? Because Patan̄jali (the Sūtrakāra) has said *yogāngānuṣṭhānādaśuddhikṣaye jñānadiptirāvivekakhyāteḥ[^175].*He also says *nirvicāravaiśāradye* *dhyātmaprasādah*[^176](and)*ṛtaṃbharā* *tatra* *prajñā[^177].*Similarly, Vyāsa (theBhāṣyakāra) has also said "yastvekāgre cetasi sa bhūtamartham pradyotayati".⁵Anddiscriminate-discernment is the knowledge of an object as it really is.Therefore,it isproper that the means to that (discriminate-discernment) which is the instruction rgarding yoga, is the first stated sūtra.

[^175]: "YS, II.28. By practice of the different means to yoga, when there is destruction of impurity, therearises the light of knowledge culminating in discriminate-discernment."

[^176]: "Ibid., I.47. 'On attaining clarity of the super-reflective state there is purity proceeding from the self.'"

[^177]: "Ibid., I.48. In that super-reflective balanced state there is discernment known asṛtaṃbharā."

 ननु च योगाङ्गानुष्ठानाद्विवेकख्यातिः, तत्र वक्तव्यं 'अथ योगाङ्गानुशासनम्' इति।

 Objection — But then discriminate-discernment is the result of the (practice of) the (various) means to yoga. Therefore it should be said 'Now the instruction regarding the means to yoga is begun[^178] and the means are the different means (limbs) which result in discriminate-discernment. Therefore the second objection of the pūrvapakṣin.")."

[^178]: "The end is yoga (prajñā

 न— फलेनोपक्रमात्।योगाङ्गानुष्ठानस्य हि फलं योग इति तदुपक्रमो युक्तः॥

 Answer—That is not so, because it is proper to begin with the result[^179]. The result of the (practice of the) means to yoga is yoga itself; therefore it is proper to begin withthat (yoga)

[^179]: "The general style of discussion is hinted at here. This reminds one of the 'pañcāvayava' syllogism ofthe Naiyāyikas where the end is first stated as pratijñā. Pratijñāhetūdāharaṇopanayanigamanānyavayavāḥ,"

 यद्येवं हानेनोपक्रम्येत—

 Objection—But then, in that case, it should begin with the cessation (removal) of pain (release, kaivalya).

 न—तस्योपेयत्वात्–उपेयमेव हि तत्।योगः पुनः स्वाङ्गानामुपेयश्च, उपायश्च विवेकख्यातेरणिमादिप्राप्तेश्चेत्यभ्यर्हिततरः फलतदुपायरूपत्वात्॥

Answer—That is not so, as that is the end i.e., it is indeed the end (goal[^180]).Again

[^180]: "It has already been stated that discussion of the means will automatically bring in discussion on allits different aspects."

^(5.)VBH, under YS,1.1. Inthe one-pointed mindthers is illumination of the objectas it really is.the bhāsya reads as 'sadhūtamartham' in all available texts but here the reading is 'sa bhūtammartham'. It could also be an omission by the scribe.



yoga is also the goal of its (own) means[^181]and it is the means to discriminate-discernment and to the attainment of (powers) like atomisation[^182], etc. Therefore it is moresuited (to be mentioned first) both as the end and as the means to the end[^183] to yoga.").

[^181]: "The means to yoga."

[^182]: "These are the powers or siddhis which are attained by the practice of yoga. They aredescribed laterin the Vibhūtipāda."

[^183]: "End of the means to yoga and the means to discriminate-discernment. Here the word yoga is beingused both as the end and as the means. When used as the end it will stand for kaivalya and when used asthe means it will stand for the eight means ( aids

 उत्तरसूत्रार्थत्वाच्च।न हि 'अथ योगाङ्गानुशासनम्' इत्युक्ते 'योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः' इति युक्तं वक्तुम्।तदाहि 'यमनियमा' दिसूत्रमेव पठितव्यं स्यात्॥

 Moreover, because of the meaning of the next sūtra[^184]also (it is proper to begin withyoga). If it (the sūtra ) is stated as 'atha yogāngānuśāsanam' (Now the exposition onthe means to yoga is begun) it will not be proper to say 'Yoga is the restriction of themodifications of the mind'. Then the sūtra should have been 'yamaniyama[^185].....'

[^184]: "YS, I.2."

[^185]: "Ibid., II.29. This sūtra lists the eight means to yoga and would have fitted better as the second sutrain that case."

 अथ तदेव पठितव्यमिति चेत्–न–योगोपेयाया हानोपायभूताया विवेकख्यातेः,फलस्य च हानस्य,संबन्धदर्शनार्थत्वात् 'योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः' इत्यस्य॥

 If it is said that ‘yes that should have been stated (as the second sūtra ). then theanswer is, it is not so; in order to show the relationship between the result which isrelease and discriminate-discernment which is the means to release, which is the endof yoga (the next sūtra is stated as) *Yoga is the restriction of the modifications of themind.*

 कथं पुनरेतत्संबन्धप्रदर्शनार्थम् ? यावता निर्बीजसमाधिलक्षणाभिधानमेतत्।सत्यमेवं, तथापिहानतदुपायसंबन्धमवद्योतयदेव सूत्रं निर्बीजसमाधिलक्षणतामापद्यते॥

 न हि निरोधलक्षणात् समाधेरर्थान्तरं हानम्। किंत्वेतावता विशेषः निरोधलक्षणसमाधौ पुनः प्रवृत्तिः, हाने त्वात्यन्तिकी निवृत्तिरिति समाध्यवस्थायां तु हानाविशेष एव।तथा चाह— “तदा द्रष्टुः स्वरूपेऽवस्थानम्”इति।“स्वरूपप्रतिष्ठा च चितिशक्तिः कैवल्यम्” इति स्वरूपप्रतिष्ठत्वं हि कैवल्यमाह।ततश्च निर्बीजसमाधिना कैवल्यमेव शास्त्रार्थप्रत्ययद्रढिम्ने साक्षात्क्रियते॥

 Objection — But then, how does the sūtra show this relationship. It is only a definition of the nature of 'seedless-samādhi'.

 Answer—Yes, that is true. Even then it is only by indicating the relationship between release and its means that the sūtra takes on the nature of the definition ofseedless-samādhi. Release is not something different from samādhi of the nature oftotal restriction. But this is the only difference; in the samādhi of total restriction thereis again activity[^186]" whereas in release there is absolute cessation (of activity[^187]).At thetime of total restriction (during nirodha-samādhi) there is no difference from release

[^186]: "This is probably referring to the stage of jīvanmukti or the initial stages of nirodha-samādhi wherethe samskāras of nirodha are still not very strong."

[^187]: "This is kaivalya, so there is total cessation."



Thus it is also mentioned (in the Yogasūtras) *tadā draṣṭuḥsvarūpe' vasthānam[^188]* i.e., kaivalya is the abiding (of the seer) in oneself. In confirmation of the idea conveyedby the meaning of the śāstra (Yogasūtra[^189]),
it follows that through nirodha-samādhi,kaivalya alone is directly experienced.

[^188]: "YS, I.3. At that time the seer abides in itself."

[^189]: "Ibid., IV.34. It is the power of consciousness established in its own nature."

 तस्माद्यदुच्यते कैश्चित् सबीजसमाधिः कैवल्यसाधनमिति–तन्न–किं तर्हि ? ख्यातिरेव साधनमविद्यानिवृत्तिद्वारेण। अविद्यानिमित्तो हि बन्धः तस्माद्यद्यपि योगानुशासनं सूत्रितम्,तथापि ख्यात्यर्थत्वाद्योगस्यतद्द्वारेण ख्यातिहानसंबन्धमपि दर्शयतीति,सुष्ठूच्यते उत्तरसूत्रसंबन्धार्थं च योगानुशासनमिति सूत्रयितव्यमिति।

 Objection—But some[^190]say that samādhi with seed is a means to kaivalya.

[^190]: "There must have been such a school to which the Vivaraṇakāra is referring."

 Answer—That is not true. Why is it not true ? Knowledge alone is a means(tokaivalya[^191]) through removal of ignorance. Bondage has avidyā as its cause, therefore,even though the instruction of yoga is stated in the (first sūtra) still, as yoga has themeaning of knowledge, through that, the relationship between knowledge and release[^192]is indicated. Therefore it is correctly said that, in order to connect it (the firstsūtra) with the next sūtra as well, it has to be stated as 'the exposition on yoga isbegun' (and not exposition on yogāṅga).

[^191]: "This is significant as it points to the belief in knowledge alone to be the means to mokṣa."

[^192]: "Knowledge of the difference between puruṣa and prakṛti"

 यद्यपि फलार्थिनां तत्फलसाधनं प्रत्युत्पन्नाकाङ्क्षाणां साधनोपदेशोऽप्यस्ति तथापि न तत्प्रयोजनम्, सर्वस्यफलोद्देशेन प्रवृत्तेस्तदेव प्रयोजनमिति।

 Though it is a means to gain the ends, for those desiring these ends[^193], and it is also an advice (instruction) regarding the means to those having such expectations[^194]still,that is not its purpose; it is only mentioning that all activity which is done with theaim of achieving some ends result in that alone[^195].

[^193]: "This is perhaps a reference to the attainment of various 'siddhis' for which yoga was used by some."

[^194]: "Expectations to gain siddhis in the common man."

[^195]: "There is a hint of derision regarding those who want to achieve only such siddhis through yoga."

योगानुशासनमिति।यथा शिष्योऽनुशिष्यते विशिष्टप्रवृत्तिनिवृत्तिनियमद्वारेण तथा विशिष्टसाध्यसाधनतदङ्गनियममात्रसादृश्यादन्तेवास्यनुशासनवद्योगानुशासनमित्युच्यते।अनुशिष्टिरनुशासनं, योगोऽनुशिष्यतेऽनेनास्मिन्निति वा योगानुशासनं शास्त्रम्॥

* Yogānuśāsanam—*Just as a disciple is taught through rules as to what is to be done in particular and what is not to be done similarly, this exposition on yoga is like the instruction to the disciple because of its similarity regarding the means to the specialend along with its various divisions (parts). Exposition is instruction. The work whichis an exposition of yoga means that through this (work), yoga is being taught or yogais taught in this work.

 अथेत्ययमधिकारार्थः। अधिकारः आरम्भः प्रस्तावः, अर्थोऽभिधेयोऽस्य शिष्टस्मृतिप्रामाण्यात्।

 "athetyayamadhikārārthaḥ”—“adhikāra” means beginning, commencement; its





meaning is directly expressed[^196]. This is based on the authority of the memory of the learned.

[^196]: "There is no need to resort to lakṣaṇā in order to get at the meaning of the word adhikāra."

 ननु चानन्तर्यार्थस्याथशब्दस्य स्मरन्ति शिष्टाः।तथा चाह—“वृत्तादनन्तरस्य प्रक्रियार्थो दृष्टः” इति।न—सर्वत्रारम्भार्थत्वात्।आनन्तर्यस्य च गम्यमानत्वात्।यथा पुत्र इत्युक्ते पिता गम्यते,न च पुत्रशब्दस्यार्थःपिता, तथेहाप्यारम्भ एवाभिधीयते, आनन्तर्यं तु प्रतीयते॥अत एव च 'वृत्तादनन्तरस्य प्रक्रियार्थो दृष्टः' इत्युच्यते।यदि चानन्तर्यार्थोऽभविष्यत्तदा 'वृत्तादानन्तर्येऽर्थे प्रक्रियाः' इत्यवदिष्यत्।अनन्तरस्येतिचानन्तरभाविन एवाभिधानम्॥

 Objection—But then, the learned remember the meaning of the word *atha* in thesense of continuity. Thus it is said (by Śabara), We see that the word *atha* has themeaning of something coming immediately after some event[^197].'

[^197]: "Śābarabhāsya on Mīmāmsāsūtra, 1.1.1."

 Answer—That is not so, everywhere it has the meaning of commencement andcontinuity is understood. Just as when one says 'son' one understands the 'father' (aswell) but it does not mean that the word 'son' means 'father'; similarly here also,what is directly expressed is the beginning and continuity is understood[^198].And that iswhy it is said (by Śabara that) 'We see that the word *atha* has the meaning of somethingcoming immediately after some event.'In case there was the sense of continuity thenthe reading (in Śabara's commentary) would be ‘We see that the word *atha* (beginning)has the meaning of coming immediately after some event.'Whereas 'something coming immediately after' can only mean that which comes immediately after[^199]'.

[^198]: "'Son' implies a continuity i.e., that he is the child of a father and so the meaning 'father' is also understood here. Thus the vācyārtha or expressed meaning is son while the lakṣaṇārtha or implied meaning is father, mother, grandfather and so on."

[^199]: "Thus it means a beginning"

 अपि चैवं हि स्मृतिः—“किञ्चिदव्ययं विभक्त्यर्थप्रधानं किञ्चित्क्रियाप्रधानं।उच्चैर्नीचैरित्यादिविभक्त्यर्थ–प्रधानम्, हिरुक् पृथगित्यादि क्रियाप्रधानम्” \[इति\]।न चैतद्व्यतिरेकेणाव्ययानामर्थो विद्यते।तत्राथशब्दस्यानन्तर्यार्थत्वे सति विभक्त्य (क्ति) श्रवणमयुक्तम् सत्त्वप्रधानत्वात्।आरम्भक्रियार्थत्वे तु नविभक्त्य(र्थ)श्रवणमयुक्तम्,असत्त्वप्रधानत्वादिति॥

 Moreover, there is the following traditional (grammatical) statement 'Some indeclinable has the sense of the case inflection as important and some has the verbalsense as important'. Thus indeclinables like uccaiḥ, nīcaiḥ, etc., have the sense of thecase inflection as important whereas (indeclinables like ) hiruk, pṛthak, etc., have theverbal sense as important[^200].

[^200]: "MBH, I.1.37."

 And apart from these two meanings there is no other meaning possible for theindeclinables. In that context, when the word *atha* means immediate continuity[^201] thenit is not improper to take it to mean a case inflection; the importance in that context isa thing (a state). And when it ( the word *atha*) is used in the sense of the verbal actionof commencement then it is not improper not to take it to mean a 'case inflection[^202]'' asthe importance in that context is not of a thing (a state).

[^201]: "It is the case inflection which is important then."

[^202]: "Two negatives make a positive i.e., then it means a verbal action here."

 तस्मादथशब्दः प्रस्तावार्थ एवेति युक्तमथेत्यधिकारार्थ इति।स्वरूपावद्योतनार्थ इति शब्दः।यथा गौरित्याहेति ।



प्रसिद्धोऽप्यथशब्दार्थोऽधिक्रियमाणविषये शिष्यबुद्धिसमाधानार्थं कीर्त्यते।सिद्धो ह्ययं न्यायः श्रुतौ“व्याख्यास्यामि ते व्याचक्षाणस्य तु मे निदिध्यासस्व" इति॥

 Therefore the word *atha* is used (here) only in the sense of beginning and thus it is proper that (Vyāsa says that) the word *atha* is used in the sense of beginning. Theword "iti" is used in order to draw attention to itself[^203],as is done in such examples as 'He said a cow'.

[^203]: "At the beginning Vyāsa draws attention to the word atha by pointing it out using the word 'iti' as isdone when somebody says 'cow'."

 Though the meaning of the word *atha* is well-known still it is used in order to drawthe attention of the mind of the disciple towards the topic to be begun. The followingprinciple is well-known in the ( learning of the ) scriptures—

'I shall explain to youand while I am explaining, you reflect (on its meaning).[^204]

 कः पुनर्योगो यस्यानुशासनं प्रस्तुतमिति आह—योगः समाधिरिति ॥ समाधिग्रहणा

[^204]: "Br. Up., II.4.4."

त् 'युजिर्योगे' इतिनिवर्त्य 'युज समाधौ' इत्ययं गृहीतः।योगः समाधानम्।

 Now what is this yoga whose exposition is begun? In answer to that Vyāsa says“yogaḥsamādhiḥ" By understanding (yoga) as "samādhi" he takes it to be derivedfrom the root ‘yuj' which means samādhi[^205] leaving out the sense of the root ‘yuj’ asunion (yoge). Yoga is a complete oneness (abstract contemplation).

[^205]: "Pān. Astā. Dhātu., IV.68."

 ननु च 'योगः समाधिः' इत्येवमन्तेन व्याख्याते सूत्रे ‘स च सार्वभौमः' इत्यादि भाष्यमसंबन्धं दृश्यते।

 Objection— But then, when the sūtra[^206] has been explained as ‘yoga is samādhi' thesubsequent commentary saying sa ca sārvabhaumaḥ[^207]', etc., appears to be disconnected (irrelevant).

[^206]: "YS, I.1."

[^207]: "The sūtra has already been explained by defining yoga and samadhi. Now to say that it is a qualitywhich belongs to all the stages of the mind seems irrelevant."

 नैष दोषः।इह समाधिरित्युक्ते, समाधीयमानापेक्षत्वात्, समाधीयमानानां च बहुत्वात्, किमात्मा समाधीयते ? किं वा शरीरम् आहोस्विदिन्द्रियाणि, इति बहुधा विप्रतिपत्तेः, स्वविशेषणाकाङ्क्षत्वाच्च समाधेः, कस्यायम् ?किं विशेषणकः ? इत्यनुषक्ते प्रश्ने इदमाह—स च सार्वभौमश्चित्तस्य धर्म इति।चित्तस्य धर्मो नात्मादीनाम्।तच्च चित्तं स्वयमेव समाधीयतेऽन्तरनिरपेक्षत्वात् ॥

 Answer—This is no defect. In this context, when 'samādhi' is mentioned it is inneed of an explanation as to what is that to which samādhi has to be applied. This isso because there is an abundance of things to which samādhi can be applied; as, forinstance, one can ask—(1) Is it the ātman to which samādhi has to be applied or (2) Isit the body or (3) Is it again the sense-organs; thus there are all kinds of doubts.

 The use of the word 'samādhi' raises the expectation of its own qualification likewhose is it and what is its nature[^208]?” When these questions are connected (with samādhi )(Vyāsa ) says (in answer) “and that is a quality of the mind which belongs to all ( its)

[^208]: "Whose samadhi are we talking about--this is one expectation and the second expectation is to know its nature."





stages” i.e., this is a quality of mind and not of the ātman. etc. And that mind applies samadhi to itself as it is not dependent on another for its samādhi.

 काः पुनर्भूमय इत्यत आह—क्षिप्तं मूढमित्यादयो भूमय इति।क्षिप्तमिति कर्मकर्तरि निष्ठा।यथा भिन्नः कुसूलः स्वयमेवेति।क्षिप्तमनिष्टविषयासञ्जनेन स्तिमितम्।मूढं निर्विवेकं।विक्षिप्तं नानाक्षिप्तम्।कर्मकर्तर्येव।विवेकाक्षमं च विक्षिप्तत्वादेव।एकाग्रं तुल्यप्रत्ययप्रवाहम्।निरुद्धमिति प्रत्ययशून्यं चित्तम्॥

 In answer to the question as to what are the states (of the mind) he (Vyāsa) further says “The states are the restless, the infatuated, and so on.[^209] “ksiptam” means thatwhich is involved in the state of being the agent of (various) actions[^210]; like the granarycontaining various grains imagining itself to be all that. The restless state is agitated.through being attached to undesirable objects[^211]. The infatuated state is without anydiscrimination. The distracted is attracted towards different directions in the state ofbeing the agent of (different) actions. It is due to the distracted state that the mind isincapable of discrimination. The one-pointed state is the state where there is the flowof the same thought (in the mind). And the restricted state is when the mind is emptyof thoughts.

[^209]: "The others are the distracted, the one-pointed and the restricted."

[^210]: "The concern here is only of various actions."

[^211]: "It it thus not in the realm of higher things and is bound to day-to-day objects. This compares to thepreyas idea of the Kathopaniṣad and the yogakṣema concept of the Gītā."

 ननु च भूमिषु धर्मेषु विवक्षितेषु किमर्थं क्षिप्तमित्यादिना धर्म्युच्यते ?

 Objection— But then, when it is desired to mention the quality of the states, why is the qualified (mind) being described through the restless state, etc.

 नैष दोषः,धर्मिणा धर्म एवोपदिश्यते।धर्माणां धर्मिविषयत्वात्।यथा गोत्वे किं लिङ्गमिति पृष्टे, विषाणीककुद्मान् प्रान्तवालधिरिति धर्मिणा धर्म एवोपदिश्यते।तस्मात् क्षेपादयश्चित्तस्य भूमयो धर्मा इत्यर्थः॥

 Answer—This is not a defect; through the qualified substance he is giving instruction about the quality alone, as the qualities belong to the (substance) qualified. Justas when someone asks what is the distinguishing mark of the bovine nature the answer is 'that which has horns, that which has a hump, that which has a hairy tail at theend', all of which mention the qualities through the subject.Therefore he means tosay that the restless and other states are the qualities of the mind.

 ननु च भूमीनां चित्तधर्मत्वे समाधेश्च, कथं भूमिभिः समाधिराधारत्वेन विशेष्यते सार्वभौम इति ?

 Objection— But then, if the stages are qualities of the mind so is samādhi ( a quality of the mind). Then how is it that, on the basis of samādhi as the support, thevarious stages are distinguished, using the description that "it belongs to all the states[^212]."

[^212]: "If samādhi is only one of the qualities how can it qualify all the different states and be the support for all the states."

 सामान्यभूतत्वात् समाधेः।भूमीनां च विशेषत्वात्।यथा क्षिप्तं तिष्ठति मूढं तिष्ठति,विक्षिप्तमेकाग्रंचेति,क्षिप्तादि भूमिषु स्थितिरनुवर्तते सामान्यम्।स्थितिश्च समाधिः।तस्मात् सामान्यरूपं सर्वासु भूमिषुप्राधान्येन वर्तत इति।'सर्वभूमिपृथिवी' इत्यैश्वर्यार्थीयोऽण्प्रत्ययः।अनुशतिकादित्वादुभयपदवृद्धिः।अन्ये



पुनर्बाह्याध्यात्मिकान् संयमविषयान् भूमय इत्याचक्षते।तेषां'विक्षिप्ते चेतसि' इति समानाधिकरण्यानुपपत्तिः।स्ववचनविरोधश्च कथम् ?

Answer—This is because samādhi is common to all the states and because thestates are all distinct (from each other). We say—'now there is the restless state','now there is the infatuated state', 'now there is the distracted' and 'now the one-pointed state'; in the different states of restless, etc., there is the common underlyingfactor of steadiness.And steadiness is samādhi. Therefore the common factor existsin a predominant manner in all the states. The word "sārvabhauma" comes from theword 'sarvabhūmi (pṛthivi[^213]. Pāṇ. Aṣṭā., VII.3.20."))'with the affix 'an' added in the sense of predominance;it takes 'vṛddhi' in both vowels by the rule anuśatikāditvādubhayapadavṛddhiḥ. Thereare others who say that the states are the external and internal objects of concentration (saṃyama[^214]).But then there will be difficulty with the next sentence "vikṣiptecetasi" where both the words are in the same case ending.³ So how can the commentator (Vyāsa) contradict himself.

[^213]: "Sarvabhūmi with ‘aṇ' affix in the sense of power (predominance

[^214]: "Though 'saṃyama' is a technical word in yoga, it seems to be used in the sense of concentrationhere."

 क्षिप्यतेऽस्मिन्निति क्षिप्तम्,मुह्यतेऽस्मिन्निति मूढं,यदा चैवं न तदा संयमविषयता।तत्र क्षेपाद्यसंभवात्।एकाग्रावस्थायां हि संयमो भवति॥

 That in which there is restlessness is restless, that in which there is infatuation isinfatuated; when this is so it cannot be the object of 'saṃyama' (concentration) at thesame time[^215], as in the state of 'saṃyama' there is absence of restlessness and so on.Saṃyama is possible only in the state of one-pointedness.

[^215]: "Cf. Supra, n. 2. Restlessness and infatuation are not objects of concentration."

 किं चान्यत्—क्षिपेश्च ध्रौव्याद्यर्थाभावादधिकरणे निष्ठाप्रत्ययाभावः।किं च—निरुद्धे चेतसि संयमस्यापितत्राभावात् वृत्तिशून्यत्वात् संयम विषयाभावः।न हि निरोधे विषयविशेषे चित्तं निरुध्यते।तदा हिविषयित्वान्निवर्तते।परिगणनानुपपत्तिश्च।न हि क्षिप्तादयः पञ्चैव संयमस्य विषयाः।तेषामानन्त्यात्॥

 Moreover, there is this additional point-In the state of restlessness, as there is nofixed object, there is an absence of a fixed thought. And furthermore, when the mindis restricted, since there is the absence of even saṃyama (concentration), then due tothe absence of the modifications (of the mind) there is the absence (in that state) ofthe object of saṃyama. In the restricted state, the mind is not fixed to any particularobject; for in that state it has turned away from having any object.Again it is meaningless to count the states (in that case)⁵. It is not the case that there are only fiveobjects of saṃyama like the restless, etc., as they are endless.

—————————————————————————————————————

^(3.)Here the mind is in the state of distraction as both the words are in apposition to each other. Vikṣiptais not an object of the mind but the mind itself. Therefore the state of the mind is not described by theobject on which it is concentrated but by the state it itself is in, even though the state can be broughtabout by any object.

^(5.)The discussion on whether the objects of ‘saṃyama' can be described as states of the mind is continuing. Since the objects are endless it will not make sense to enumerate only five states of the mind asVyāsa has done.



 ननु चान्यथा योगं केचिदिच्छन्ति।तथा चाहुः—“इन्द्रियमनोऽर्थसन्निकर्षात् सुखदुःखे, तदनारम्भ आत्मस्थे मनसि,\[स\] शरीरस्य सुखदुःखाभावः प्राणमनोविनिग्रहापेक्षः संयोगो (योग) इति"।तदितिप्रकृतापेक्षम्।योऽसौ सुखदुःखयोरात्मेन्द्रियमनोऽर्थसन्निकर्षो हेतुः, तस्यानारम्भः तदनुत्पत्तिः।स कथं भवति? आत्मस्थेमनसि, नेन्द्रियस्थे। सशरीरस्य अविशीर्णशरीरस्य।तदा कारणाभावात् कार्याभाव इति,सन्निकर्षाभावेसुखदुःखयोरप्यभावः तस्यामवस्थायां योऽसौ विभोरात्मनो मनसा संयोगः स प्राणमनोविनिग्रहापेक्षःसंयोगविशेषो योग इति ॥

 Objection—But then, yoga is also described in a different way by some others.¹ Thus they say—‘when there is pleasure and pain due to the contact of the sense organs and the mind with the objects, its non-origin[^216]due to the mind abiding in theself, is the absence of pleasure and pain of the embodied one; and yoga is the unionbased on the restraint of the prānas ³and the mind'.

[^216]: "Non-origin of pleasure and pain."

 The word 'tat' i.e., that refers to what is being discussed[^217].

[^217]: "The non-origin of pleasure and pain is the subject under discussion."

 The reason for pleasure and pain is the contact of the object with the sense-organs,the mind and the ātman; its non-origin is its non-arising[^218]. How can that be broughtabout? By the mind abiding in the self and not by (its) abiding in the sense-organs.The phrase ‘saśarīrasya[^219]' means 'of the body which has still not fallen[^220]'.Then, in the absence of the cause, there is the absence of the effect; i.e., in the absence of contact,there is the absence of pleasure and pain as well. And in that state, that union of theall-pervading self with the mind is based on the restraint of the prāṇas and the mind;this is a special union and is yoga.

[^218]: "This refers to the Nyāya-Vaiseṣika theory of how experience of pleasure and pain comes about. One can stop this from rising, he says."

[^219]: "He is explaining the usage of the term saśarīra."

[^220]: "It is relevant to talk about yoga and absence of pleasure and pain only in one who is alive and not inone who is not alive or has no body."

 अत्रोच्यते— आत्मस्थे मनसीत्ययुक्तम्, सर्वदा आत्मस्थत्वान्मनसः।इन्द्रियादिसन्निकर्षानारम्भापेक्षयाआत्मस्थे इति चेत्, तदनारम्भ इत्येव सिद्धत्वादात्मस्थे मनसीत्यनर्थकं स्यात् ॥

 Answer—In this context it is said it is not proper to say 'when the mind abides inthe self' since the mind is abiding in the self at all times.

 Objection—It is said that it only means that it abides in the self on the basis of thenon-origin of the contact with the sense-organs, etc.

 Answer—Then, since that is well-known as the non-origin (of contact), to call it asthe mind abiding in the self is meaningless.

 किं चान्यत्—मुक्तस्यापि मनस आत्मस्थत्वादिन्द्रियसनन्निकर्षाभावाच्च योगः प्राप्नोति।तस्यापि हिसर्वगतत्वात् मनसश्च नित्यत्वात् सर्वदात्मस्थत्वमेव ॥

It appears that the Vivaraṇakāra is referring to the various definitions of yoga itself. This is interesting as Vācaspati Miśra, Vijñānabhikṣu and others have not discussed this aspect. This is a reference toVaiś. Sūtra, 5.2.15 tadanārambhah ātmasthe manasi śarīrasya duhkhābhāvah sa yogaḥ.

The prāṇas are generally considered to be five depending on their various functions. They are prāṇa, apāna, samāna, vyāna and udāna. hṛdi prāno gude' pānaḥsamāno nābhisansthitaḥ, udānaḥkaṇthadeśasthovyānaḥ sarvasarīragaḥ.  




 किं च—आत्मनः प्रदेशाभावादात्मस्थ इत्ययुंक्तम्।न चाप्युपचरितात्मप्रदेशसंयोगः परमार्थस्य योगस्य हेतुः स्यात्।उपचरितस्य मिथ्यात्वात् ॥

 Moreover there is this additional point—

even in the case of one who is liberated,as the mind is established in the self, there is absence of contact with the sense-organs, etc., therefore he also attains yoga[^221]. In his case also, since he is all-pervadingand the mind is eternal, it must always abide in the ātman.

[^221]: "A jīvanmukta is a yogī."

 Moreover, as the ātman has no location, it is not proper to say 'abiding in the self'.And again union with the ātman, figuratively conceived to occupy a space, cannot bethe basis for the highest kind of yoga; since what is figuratively conceived is false[^222].

[^222]: "It is interesting to note the quibbling based on both the linguistic and philosophical meaning ofwords."

किं चान्यत्—मनोऽर्थसन्निकर्षाभाव इत्येव सिद्धेः (द्धं) इन्द्रियग्रहणमनर्थकं स्यात्।अथेन्द्रियैर्विनामनोऽर्थसन्निकर्षाभावात्तदनारम्भ इति प्राप्त्यभावे प्रतिषेधो न युक्त इति चेत् ।

 Moreover, there is this additional point—It is well-known that the mind has no(direct) contact with the objects; therefore it is meaningless to bring in the sense-organs.[^223]

 Question — Without the sense-organs there is no contact of the mind with the object, then to say that there is its non-origin and thus deny something which does notexist (in the first place ) is not proper.

[^223]: "In order to establish contact, the sense-organs are being brought in. It does not however prove thedirect contact of the mind with the objects."

 नैतदेवम्, विनेन्द्रियैर्मनोऽर्थसन्निकर्षो नास्तीत्यर्थात् सन्निकर्षप्रतिषेधं कुर्वता विषयप्राप्तिरिन्द्रियद्वाराप्रतिपादिता स्यात् ॥

Answer—But that is not the case; without the sense-organs there is no contact ofthe mind with the objects; since this is so, to deny the contact (of the mind with theobjects) will be to accept the grasping of the objects through the sense-organs[^224].

[^224]: "Since that is against one's experience one has to accept the contact of the mind through the senses."

 किं चान्यत्—सर्वप्राणभाजामिन्द्रियमनोऽर्थसन्निकर्षात् सुखदुःखप्रतिलम्भस्य प्रसिद्धत्वादात्मनःसम्बन्धस्य च नित्यत्वात् सुखदुःखाभावो योग इत्येव सिद्धेः, तत्र \[सूत्र\] शेषोऽनर्थकः स्यात् ॥

 Answer—Moreover, there is this additional point—it is well-known that all livingbeings (things) experience pleasure and pain by the contact of the mind and the senseswith the objects (of pleasure and pain) and (it is well-known that ) the contact of the mind with the ātman is eternal; and since it is established that yoga is the absence ofpleasure and pain the rest of the sūtra (Vaiśesika) is unnecessary[^225].

[^225]: "Vaiś. Sūtra, 5.2.18."

 अथापि स्यादिन्द्रियमनोऽर्थसन्निकर्षग्रहणादृते सुखदुःखाभाव इत्येतावति सति मुक्तस्यापि सुखदुःखाभावाद्योगित्वप्रसङ्ग इति तन्निवृत्त्यर्थं सूत्रशेषग्रहणमिति।तच्च न, मुक्तस्य सुखदुःखप्राप्त्यभावात्, प्राप्तिपूर्वप्रतिषेधस्य न्याय्यत्वात्, यस्य सुखदुःखप्राप्तिः, तद्विषयः सुखदुःखाभाव एव योग इति सूत्रशेषप्रत्याख्यानंयुज्यते॥

Objection—But then, even if the sūtra just says that (yoga) is absence of pleasure





and pain without mentioning the contact of the mind and the senses with the objects,there will be the undesirable consequence of even a liberated self practising yoga, asin his case also there is absence of pleasure and pain[^226].Therefore, in order to avoidthat, one has to accept the rest of the sūtra-reading.

[^226]: "Thus there will be the defect of ativyāpti or over-pervasion in this definition according to thepūrvapakṣin."

 Answer—That is not so; in the case of the liberated self there is absence of obtaining pleasure and pain; it is logical to prohibit something which can be obtained (possessed).

 Thus yoga is applied to the absence of pleasure and pain in one who has access topleasure and pain (and not to any other); therefore the rejection of the rest of the(Vaiśesika) sūtra is quite in order.

 किं चान्यत्—उपात्तेऽपि सशरीरग्रहणे मुक्ताद्विनिवृत्तिर्न शक्यते कर्तुम्,निष्प्रयोजनत्वात्। सुखदुःखाभावश्चेद्योगः, विद्यमानमपि शरीरं कार्याकरणादनर्थकं स्यात्। कार्यानपेक्षायां हि मुक्तामुक्तयोरविशेष एव॥

 Moreover, there is this additional point. Even if it is conceded that the liberated soul is embodied, a return from the state of liberation is not possible, as it serves nouseful purpose. If yoga is the absence of pleasure and pain, then even in the presenceof the body, since it is not the instrument for the effect (of pleasure and pain) it servesno purpose. In the indifference to the effect (of pleasure and pain) there will be nodifference between one who is liberated and one who is not.

 किं चान्यत्—प्राणमनोविनिग्रहापेक्ष इत्यापि न घटते। विधारकस्य प्रयत्नस्यात्मसमवेतत्वादविद्यमानेऽपि मनसः क्रियावत्त्वे इन्द्रियेणासंयुज्य मनः प्राण \[मनो\] निग्रहौ न कर्तुं पर्याप्यते। इन्द्रियसंयोगे च मनसः,तदनारम्भ इत्ययुक्तम्। मनसश्च प्राणनिग्रहे व्यापृ(वृ) तत्वादनारम्भानुपपत्तिः ॥

 Moreover there is this additional point. It is not correct to say that it is dependenton the restraint of the prāṇas and the mind. The restraining effort is (supposed to be)inherent in the ātman and though the mind has no action (i.e. it is not an agent[^227] ), without the conjunction with the senses, the mind is incapable of restraining the prāṇasand the mind (i.e., itself). When the mind is connected with the senses then it is notproper to say that (yoga) is in its non-origin[^228].Since the mind is occupied in the control of the prāna it is not correct to say that there is its non-origin (of activity).

[^227]: "The mind is not a kartã, therefore it cannot act independently."

[^228]: " The stress is on the mind's connection with the senses for any activity. And when the mind isconnected with the senses even in the act of restraint, it is not proper to describe yoga and the absence ofthis contact."

 न चासति इन्द्रियवायुसन्निकर्षे प्राणनिग्रहः। न चानिगृहीते प्राणे योगः, आत्मस्थविधारकप्रयत्नद्वारामनोगतक्रियासंबन्धहेतुत्वात् प्राणनिग्रहस्य॥

 When there is no contact with the senses and the (vital) airs[^229] there can be no control of the prānas. And there can be no 'yoga' when the prāna is uncontrolled. In thecontrol of the prāṇa, the cause of the connection with mental activity is through theeffort of the restrainer residing in the self.

[^229]: "Vāyu is being used in the sense of prāṇa."

 अथापि स्याद्योगः समाधिरिति। तच्च न, निष्क्रियत्वादात्मनो नित्यसमाधानमेव स्थितिश्च समाधिरित्युच्यते।



 तस्माद्युक्तमभिधीयते—'स च सार्वभौमश्चित्तस्य धर्मः' इति॥

  Objection—Let 'yoga' then be 'samādhi'.

 Answer—That cannot be, since the ātman is without action ( always ) (and) it iseternally in samādhi. Steadiness is samādhi (as already mentioned). Thus it is rightlysaid that 'It is the quality of the mind in all the states.'

 यद्येवं समाधिश्चेद्योगः स च सार्वभौमश्चित्तधर्मः स च सर्वजनानामयत्नसिद्धः,क्षिप्ताद्यनुगतत्वात्।तथाच सति,यथैव श्वासप्रश्वासादीनां प्रयत्नादृते सिद्धत्वात्तत्करणम(ल्लक्षणम)नर्थकम्,एवं योगानुशासनमप्यनर्थकंप्राप्तमित्यत आह—(तत्र) विक्षिप्ते चेतसि विक्षेपोपसर्जनीभूतः समाधिर्न योगपक्षे वर्तत इति॥क्षिप्ताद्यनुगतस्ययोगपक्षेऽनभिप्रेतत्वात्।न हि क्षेपाद्यनुगतः समाधिर्भूतार्थावद्योतनादिक्षमः,क्षेपादिप्रधानत्वात्।विक्षेपनिषेधेनैव हि प्रधानमल्लनिबर्हणन्यायेन क्षिप्तमूढयोरपि निषेधः कृतः।प्रधानता च विक्षेपसमाधेरधिकारयोग्यत्वात् ।विक्षेपस्थं हि चित्तमपक्षपातादिष्टं विषयमुपनेतुं शक्यते।न हि विषयासञ्जनादिना क्षिप्तमिष्टविषयवियोगादिनावा मूढमन्यथोपनेतुं पार्यते॥

 Objection—But then, if in this way, samādhi is yoga and it is the quality of themind in all its states then it is achieved by everyone without any effort, because it isunderlying (even) states like the restless state[^230].In that case, just as exhaling and inhaling exist without any effort (on one's part) so also it is meaningless to say that it( samādhi) has an instrument ( through which it can be brought about ). Then even thestatement (in the sūtra[^231] )of the exposition of yoga is meaningless.

[^230]: "Then the pūrvapakṣin wants to know what is so special about samādhi if it is common to all states ofthe mind."

[^231]: "YS, I.1"

 Answer—In that context he (Vyāsa) says “Of these, in the distracted state of mindthe samādhi being subordinated by distractions, it cannot be included in yoga[^232]"i.e.,the samādhi underlying states like restlessness, etc., is not counted under the headingof yoga. Nor is the 'samādhi' underlying states like restlessness, etc., capable of revealing the true nature of objects[^233] as in those states restlessness, etc., is predominant.By the rejection of the distracted state, the rejection of the restless and infatuatedstates have also been done; this is through the maxim of the destruction of the chiefantagonist known as 'pradhānamallanibarhaṇanyāya[^234]'.

[^232]: "VBh. under YS, I.1."

[^233]: "Yoga as samādhi is the state when by becoming one with the object of concentration, there is therevelation of the true nature of the object. This is in truth the state of seeded-samadhi."

[^234]: "The other states being distracted and infatuated."

 Since the distracted state has the inherent quality to be placed at the head it hasbeen given importance[^235]. The mind which is in a distracted state is capable of approaching any desired object without any preference, while a restless mind cannot beremoved from attachment to the object in hand[^236]and an infatuated mind cannot bediverted from its desired object.

[^235]: "The principle is that when the most formidable opponent has been defeated the less formidable arealso overcome."

[^236]: "Vyāsa describes only the vikṣipta and does not describe the kṣipta and the mūḍha by the above-saidprinciple."

 योगपक्ष इति॥समाधित्वे सत्यपि कार्याकरणात् पक्ष इत्युच्यते।यथा गच्छतः प्रतिपदं विद्यमानापि



स्थितिः स्थितिकार्याकरणान्न स्थितिरित्युच्यते।विक्षेपोपसर्जनीभूतत्वं विक्षेपस्थैकसमाधिव्यक्त्यभिप्रायेण।सार्वभौम इति तु प्राधान्यं, सामान्येन सर्वभूमिषु वृत्तेः॥

 "Yogapakṣe" and so on. Though there is samā

dhi, (in the distracted state) since it does not bring about any effect, he says "(it is not counted) under (yoga)".Thus whileone is walking, though there is a rest after every step, as the effect is not resting (atany point), therefore it is not mentioned as rest. The subordination to distractions iswith the idea of individuality i.e., that there is a single samā

dhi in the state of (asingle) distraction[^237]. The important thing here is that it is present in all states i.e., it iscommon to all the states (of the mind)[^238].

[^237]: "The difference being, that in the distracted the object of perception is desired whereas in the restlessthe mind is just led to any object it sees."

[^238]: "While yoga is not a shifting state of samādhi."

 यद्युपसर्जनीभावः समाधिपक्षावृत्तौ कारणम्, इहाप्येकाग्रे एकाग्रतोपसर्जनत्वं स्यात्।ततश्च योगपक्षावृत्तिरितिचेदत आह—यस्त्वेकाग्र इति। नैकाग्रतायां भूम्युपसर्जनत्वम्।कुतः ? क्लेशकर्माप्रबलत्वात्।क्लेशकर्माप्रबलत्वेन हि विक्षेपादीनामुदयः॥

 Objection—But then, if being subordinate is the reason for not being 'samādhi', then here also, in the one-pointed state, there will be the subordination to the state ofone-pointedness. Then it follows that it can also not be counted as yoga.

 Answer—That is why he (Vyāsa) says "In the one-pointed mind" and so on[^239].There is no subordination to the state in one-pointedness. How is that? Since (in thatstate) the afflictions and activity (due to karma) are not strong enough (to give rise totheir effects). And when the afflictions and activity (due to karma) are not strongenough then distraction, (restlessness and infatuation) do not arise.

[^239]: "In every state there is a state of steadiness which is samādhi in those states."

 एकाग्रताभूमौ समाधिर्यः स भूतमर्थं यथात्मानं प्रद्योतयति अवगमयति।अयोग्यर्थज्ञानमयथाभूतत्वगन्धितमेवेति भूतग्रहणम्।क्षिणोति,क्षपयति,पञ्चपर्वणोऽविद्यादीन् क्लेशान्।कर्मबन्धनानि,कर्माण्येवबन्धनानि,धर्माधर्मविमिश्रकर्मजातानि जन्मादिनिबन्धनानि, श्लथयति, शिथिलीकरोति, निरोधमामुखीकरोति,अभिमुखीकरोति।स सम्प्रज्ञात इत्याख्यायते आचार्यैः॥

 The samādhi in the state of one-pointedness "bhūtamartham pradyodayati[^240]"makesknown the object as it truly is. By the word 'object' one (generally) understands ameaning which is not correct i.e., that it is touched by a sense of 'what it is not'[^241].

[^240]: "VBh., under YS, I. 1."

[^241]: "It is only in yoga that one knows the true nature of an object. Thus ordinarily one does not know theobject as it is."

 "Kṣiṇoti"= weakens the afflictions which are fivefold, beginning with 'avidyā[^242]'"karmabandhanāni"= the bondages are the karma bondages i.e., which are born ofgood, bad and mixed deeds which cause the bondage of birth (and death). "ślathayati" = loosen; "nirodhamabhimukhīkaroti = brings face to face the state of restraint."sa samprajñāta iti ākhyāyate"= that is the state called samprajñāta (yoga[^243] of the object."))bythe teachers.

[^242]: "The five afflictions are avidyā, asmitā, rāga, dveșa, and abhiniveśa."

[^243]: "Samādhi in which there is consciousness (grasp



 स च वितर्कानुगतो विचारानुगत इत्यादिभाष्यम्।सम्प्रज्ञातस्य प्राथम्याल्लक्षणाभिधाने प्राप्ते, अभ्यर्हितत्वादसम्प्रज्ञातस्यैव लक्षणं युक्तमिह वक्तुमिति सम्प्रज्ञातमुपरिष्टात् प्रवेदयिष्याम इत्युच्यते॥

 The bhāṣya then states “sa ca vitarkānugato vicārānugata" and so on. As saṃprajñātais the initial stage, its definition should normally be mentioned first; but since thecommentator desires it proper to mention, in this context, the definition of 'asaṃprajñāta samādhi' he says that we will speak of saṃprajñāta yoga later.

इतश्चासम्प्रज्ञातस्य लक्षणमिहैव वक्तव्यं,सम्प्रज्ञातनिरपेक्षोऽप्यसम्प्रज्ञातः पर(प्रकृष्ट)वैराग्यविरामप्रत्ययाभ्यासाभ्यां सिध्यतीत्येतत्प्रदर्शनार्थम्।इह सम्प्रज्ञातलक्षणाभिधाने तदुत्तरकाले चासम्प्रज्ञातलक्षणाभिधानेसम्प्रज्ञातापेक्षयैव असम्प्रज्ञातसमाधावधिकार इत्याशङ्का स्यात्,तस्मादुपरिष्टात् प्रवेदयिष्याम इत्याह॥१॥

 Thus the definition of ‘asaṃprajñāta' (samādhi[^244])is given here itself,in order toindicate that ‘asaṃprajñāta' can be achieved through superior-detachment[^245] and throughthe practice of cessation of modifications which has only the subliminal-impressionsas residue[^246]without dependence on saṃprajñāta samādhi[^247].If the definition of saṃprajñāta had been given here, and the definition of asaṃprajñāta had been given later,there will be the feeling (doubt) that one can approach asaṃprajñāta only throughsaṃprajñāta; therefore he says that it ( saṃprajñāta) will be described later.

[^244]: "samādhi not conscious of an object."

[^245]: "Cf. YS, I.12."

[^246]: "Cf. YS, I.18."

[^247]: "This is an interesting point. One gets the impression in both Patañjali and the commentators likeVācaspati Miśra and Vijñānabhikṣu, that asaṃprajñāta cannot be achieved without going throughsaṃprajñāta. Even advaita has the two stages of savikalpaka and nirvikalpaka samādhi succeeding eachother respectively."

 सर्ववृत्तिनिरोधे त्वसंप्रज्ञातः (समाधिः)।तस्य लक्षणाभिधित्सयेदं सूत्रं प्रववृते—

 Whereas, when there is restriction of all activities of the mind it is '*asaṃprajñātasamādhi*'.

 With the intention of giving the definition of that (Yoga) (Patañjali) commencesthe following sūtra-

योर्गाश्चत्तवृत्तिनिरोधः॥२ ॥

 Yoga is the restriction of the modifications of the mind.

 सर्वशब्दाग्रहणात् संप्रज्ञातोऽपि योग इत्याख्यायते।चित्तं हि प्रख्याप्रवृत्तिस्थितिशीलत्वात् त्रिगुणम्।प्रख्यास्वरूपं हि चित्तसत्त्वम् रजस्तमोभ्यां संसृष्टम् ऐश्वर्यविषयप्रियं भवति।तत्तमसानुविद्धम् अधर्माज्ञानावैराग्यानैश्वर्योपगं भवति।

 तदेव प्रक्षीणमोहावरणं सर्वतः प्रद्योतमानमनुविद्धं रजोमात्रया धर्मज्ञानवैराग्यैश्वर्योपगं भवति।तदेव रजोलेशमलापेतं स्वरूपप्रतिष्ठं सत्त्वपुरुषान्यताख्यातिमात्रं धर्ममेघध्यानोपगं भवति।तत् परंप्रसड्.ख्यानमित्याचक्षते ध्यायिनः

 By non-inclusion of the word 'all' (in the definition before modification) 'saṃprajñāta' is also known as yoga.

 The mind is of a threefold nature due to its tendency towards clarity, activity (and)inertia. The sattva-mind which is of the nature of clarity, when combined with rajasand tamas becomes fond of power and objects of the senses. The same mind, when connected with tamas tends towards adharma, ignorance, non-detachment and powerlessness. The same mind, when (its) covering of delusion is removed, being brightened on all sides, connected only with rajas, tends towards merit, knowledge, detachment (and) power.

 The same mind, when the last remainder of the stain of rajas is removed, groundedin itself, having only discriminate-discernment of the difference between the intellectand the 'puruṣa',tends towards the meditation called 'dharmamegha'. That is thehighest prasaṃhyāna, say the meditators. The power of consciousness is changeless, is without movement, has objects presented to it, is pure, is without end; and this'discriminate-discernment' which is of the essence of sattva, is the opposite of that.Therefore, when the mind is detached from that, it restricts even that discriminate-discernment. In that state, (the mind) tends towards the subliminal-impressions (hasonly the subliminal-impressions left). That is the 'seedless-samādhi'. In that statethere is nothing known as an object of consciousness, therefore it is asaṃprajñāta:(thus) that yoga which is a restriction of the modifications of the mind, is of twokinds.

 सर्ववृत्तिनिरोधे त्वसंप्रज्ञात इति। तुशब्दोऽवधारणार्थः। तस्य एवंविधस्य समाधेरसंप्रज्ञातस्यैव केवलस्य लक्षणाभिधित्सयेदं सूत्रं प्रववृते प्रवृत्तं 'योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः' इ\[ती\]ति वक्तव्यम्॥

 If there is the restriction of all the modifications then it is asamprajñāta[^248]".Theword "tu" has been used for the sake of emphasis (determination). "tasya"= of samādhiwhich is of this nature; i.e., “With the intention of giving the definition of yoga(Patañjali) begins the following sūtra[^249]" i.e., it should be said that the next sūtra*yogaścittavṛttinirodhaḥ* is begun in order to define only asaṃprajñāta samādhi.

[^248]: "In the bhāṣya on YS, I.1. asaṃprajñāta is defined as such. Available readings have this portion underYS, I.1. The word 'iti' also indicates that it comes at the end of the bhāṣya I."

[^249]: "In the introduction to sūtra 1.2 Vyāsa mentions this."

 ननु च तस्य लक्षणमभिधातुमेतत् सूत्रं प्रवृत्तं,तथा च सति 'योगस्य चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः' इति वक्तव्यं,सामानाधिकरण्यं न युक्तम्। न हि लक्ष्यमेव लक्षणं स्यात्। चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधलक्षण इति वा वक्तव्यम्। नैषदोषः। लक्ष्ये लक्ष्णाध्यासात्। यथाऽयं पिण्डो देवदत्त इति लक्ष्ये लक्षणमध्यस्यते (प्रत्यस्यते)॥

 Objection—But then, if this sūtra[^250]' is begun in order to give the definition of it(samādhi) then it should have been stated as 'yogasya cittavṛttinirodhaḥ' and it is notproper to have (both) the words in apposition to each other (ending in the same case-affix[^251]),for what is defined cannot simply be the definition. Or it could have beenmentioned as '(yoga is) having the quality of restraint of all the modifications'.

[^250]: "YS, 1.2."

[^251]: "The pūrvapakṣin raises the question as to why 'yogaḥ' and 'cittavṛttinirodhaḥ' should have the same case ending if what is intended is the definition of yoga."

 Answer—This is not a defect, as there is the superimposition of the definition on



to the defined. This is like the statement 'This person is Devadatta' where there is thesuperimposition of the definition on to the defined.

 ननु च सर्ववृत्तिनिरोधे त्वसम्प्रज्ञातः,तस्य चेदं लक्षणं,ततश्च 'योगः सर्वचित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः' इति वक्तव्यम्।न चोक्तम्। अतोऽतिव्यापि लक्षणम्। सर्वशब्दाग्रहणे तावत्कारणमुच्यते— यदि सर्वग्रहणं क्रियते, तदैकदेशनिरोधनिमित्तस्य संप्रज्ञातस्य योगत्वं निवर्तितं स्यात्। तन्माभूदिति सर्वशब्दाग्रहणम्।

 Objection—But then, if asaṃprajñāta is the state when there is the restriction of allthe modifications (of the mind) then, accordingly, its definition should be ‘yoga is therestriction of all the modifications of the mind[^252]'.And it is not thus mentioned. Therefore, there is (the defect of) over-pervasion in the definition.

[^252]: "The pūrvapakṣin wants to add the word sarva to the definition."

 Answer —He mentions the reason why the word 'sarva' has not been included (inthe definition ). In case one includes the word 'sarva' (all) then there will be the denialof saṃprajñāta being yoga which has partial restriction (of the modifications) as itscause[^253]. In order to avoid that, the word 'sarva' has not been included (in the definition).

[^253]: "In saṃprajñāta also there is a one-pointed channelisation of all thoughts towards a single object.Thus there is some restriction here as well, though not a total restriction of all thoughts."

 अस्तु तर्हि संप्रज्ञातासंप्रज्ञातयोः सामान्यलक्षणं, विशेषानुपादानात् नैष दोषः। योगे प्रकृते पुनर्योगग्रहणात्।विशेषाविवक्षायां हि योगग्रहणं नार्थवत् स्यात्॥

 Objection—That means there is a common definition for both saṃprajñāta' and‘asaṃprajñāta' without employing any distinction (between the two ).

 Answer—There is no defect in that. The subject-matter under discussion is yogaas the word yoga is again mentioned (in the second sūtra also). When the distinctionis not desired to be mentioned there is meaning in the use of yoga (in both states)otherwise, there is no purpose (in putting the word yoga in both the sūtras).

 ननु चानुशासने न्याभूतत्वाद्योगस्य इह योगग्रहणे असति चित्तवृत्तिनिरोध इत्युक्तेऽनुशासनार्थता भवेत्सूत्रस्य—नैवं– योगानुशासनस्य प्रस्तुतत्वात्। योगानुशासनं हि प्रारब्धं,नायोगानुशासनं,तल्लक्षणाभिधानेह्यतिप्रसङ्गः,पदार्थासङ्गतिश्च। न हि चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधो योगानुशासनमिति पदार्थः सङ्गच्छते॥

 Objection—Since yoga is of minor importance in the ( actual) instruction, if theword yoga is not included (in the second sutra) and it is just said 'the restriction of themodifications of the mind,' then the sutra would convey (only) the meaning of instruction (exposition) (and nothing else).

 Answer—That is not true; since it is the exposition of yoga that is begun. What isbegun is the exposition of yoga and not the exposition of what is not yoga. If itsdefinition is given (in the way you say)[^254]then it will be stretching it too far and it willalso not give the meaning intended in (the sūtra on exposition of yoga) as well.

[^254]: "Just cittavr̥ttinirodhaḥ."

 एवमपि योगग्रहणात् कुतोऽसंप्रज्ञातस्यैव लक्षणं, न पुनः संप्रज्ञातस्य लक्षणं स्यात्, योगग्रहणस्याविशिष्टत्वादिति ?

 उच्यते—अव्यभिचारात्। व्यभिचरति न तत्तस्य लक्षणं,निरोधस्त्वसंप्रज्ञातेऽपि वर्तत इति संप्रज्ञातंव्यभिचरति। न हि विषाणित्वं गोर्लिङ्गं,महिष्यादिभिर्व्यभिचारात्॥



 Objection— But then, by the word yoga (in the sūtra[^184]) why should the definition ofasaṃprajñāta alone be understood; why cannot it be the definition of saṃprajñāta,since there is no special distinguishing feature in the use of the word yoga.

[^184]: "YS, I.2."

 Answer—Because there is no violation (to both the states).[^256]

 Its definition is such that it does not violate its scope. Restriction is present (completely) in asaṃprajñāta, thus saṃprajñāta is separated[^257].For instance possessing hornsis not the exclusive mark of a cow as it does not separate it from buffaloes and otheranimals (that possess horns).

[^256]: "In applying this definition to both saṃprajñāta and asaṃprajñāta there is no difficulty, as it fits both."

[^257]: "Because there is no total restriction in saṁprajñāta."

 ननु चासंप्रज्ञातमपि व्यभिचरति, संप्रज्ञातस्यापि हेयवृत्तिनिरोधत्वात्।सत्यमेवं, किं तु न निरोधादन्येनलक्षयितुमसंप्रज्ञातः शक्यते।निरोध एव तु तस्य लक्षणम्,अन्यस्याभावात्।संप्रज्ञातस्य त्वसाधारणवितर्कादिलक्षणलक्ष्यत्वात्।यथा स्पर्शलक्षणमित्युक्ते वायुरेवासाधारण्याल्लक्ष्यते स्पर्शवत्त्वेन,अथ च विद्यत एवस्पर्शवत्त्वं तेजः प्रभृतिष्वपि॥

 Objection—But then, even asaṃprajñāta is not covered exactly by this for evensaṃprajñāta has restriction of the modifications (of the mind) which are to be avoided.

 Answer—That is true, even so it is not possible to define asaṃprajñāta throughanything other than restriction; restriction alone is its definition because of the absence of any other (definition) whereas saṃprajñāta can be defined by its peculiarcharacteristics like deliberation and so on[^258]. As for instance, when one defines something as having the quality of touch, only the wind is understood as the defined because of having touch as its special quality though the quality of touch is present in light (fire) and so on[^259].

[^258]: "saṃprajñāta will be later defined as that accompanied by deliberation, reflection, bliss and sense of- I, cf. YS, I.17."

[^259]: "The other elements like fire, water and earth are also considered to have this quality."

 एवं च सति योगग्रहणमनुवादमात्रम्।अत एव च सर्वग्रहणं न कृतं सूत्रे।निरोधग्रहणेनैवासंप्रज्ञातलक्षणत्वेसिद्धे यदि सर्वग्रहणं क्रियेत,तत्संप्रज्ञातस्य योगतां निवारयेत्।तस्मादसंप्रज्ञातस्यैवेदं लक्षणम्।तथाचोपसंहरति भाष्यकारः—'न तत्र किंचित् संप्रज्ञायते इत्यसंप्रज्ञातः स योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोध' इति ॥

 Thus one should understand the word yoga here as only a repetition[^260]. And that iswhy the word 'sarva' has not been used in the sūtra[^261].Since by the use of the wordrestriction itself the definition of asaṃprajñāta has been achieved, if the word 'sarva'is used it will prevent the understanding of saṃprajñāta as yoga. Therefore this definition is that of asaṃprajñāta itself. Thus the commentator concludes that “In thatstate there is nothing known as an object of consciousness, therefore it is asaṃprajñāta;that yoga is a restriction of the modifications of the mind[^262]."

[^260]: "It is not being used in any restrictive sense."

[^261]: "In YS, I.2."

[^262]: "The word 'dvividhaḥ' has been left out by the Vivaraṇakāra. It is found in all available texts atpresent."

 चित्ततद्वृत्तितन्निरोधव्याचिख्यासया चित्तं हीत्यादि भाष्यम्।किमात्मकं पुनस्तच्चित्तं, यस्य वृत्तिनिरोधो योग इत्यत आह—चित्तं हि प्रख्याप्रवृत्तिस्थितिशीलत्वात् त्रिगुणमिति।तत्र चित्तं त्रिगुणमिति व्याख्यायते,

 In order to explain (the nature of) the mind, its modifications and its restriction(restraint) the commentator says “cittam hi” and so on. In answer to the question as towhat is the nature of that mind, the restriction of whose modifications is known asyoga, he says “cittam hi prakhyāpravrṛttisthitis̃īlattvāt trigunam[^263]".In that context heexplains the nature of the mind to be threefold (consisting of the three gunas) due toits tendency towards clarity, activity and inertia.

[^263]: "VBh., under YS, 1.2."

 “prakhyā” = perception, illumination, and that is the quality of the sattva guṇa.[^264]“pravṛtti” = motion, operation, and that is the quality of the rajas guṇa.

[^264]: "The mind, like everything else is material in the yoga system and is composed of the three gunas."

 “sthitiḥ” = stationary, warding off, obstruction; and that is the quality of the tamasguna. Thus the guṇas, sattva, etc[^265].,are of this nature and the mind is of the nature ofillumination, etc., therefore it is proper that the mind is the transformation of the threeguṇas[^266].

[^265]: "sattva, rajas and tamas."

[^266]: "The mind exhibits the three natures at different times; thus it is considered of a threefold nature."

 तस्य च प्रख्यादिहेतोरसिद्धिमाशंक्याह–प्रख्यास्वरूपं हिचित्तसत्त्वमिति।हिशब्दः प्रसिद्धावद्योतनार्थः प्रसिद्धं हि लोके शास्त्रे च सर्वावभासकत्वं चित्तस्य।चित्तमेव सत्वं चित्तसत्वं सत्त्वप्रधानगुणपरिणामत्वात्॥

 अथवा अन्यसंसर्गवियोगाभ्यामनेकवृत्ति ख्यातिमात्रं च चित्तं स्पष्टं दर्शयितुं शक्यत इति ब्रवीति प्रख्यास्वरूपं हि चित्तसत्त्वमिति ॥

 Doubting (the mind's nature ) being determined by such causes as illumination,etc., he (Vyāsa) says “prakhyāsvarūpam hi cittasattvam" and so on. The word "hi"has been used in order to indicate that it is well-known i.e., it is well-known in theworld and in the sacred texts that the mind is the illuminator (revealer) of all things.“The mind is itself sattva' that is the derivation of the word "cittasattvam" since it hasthe transformation in which there is the predominance of the sattva guṇa[^267].

[^267]: "The mind though composed of the three guṇas, has the sattvaguṇa as predominant due to its natureof illuminating objects."

 Or,it is possible to show clearly that the mind is only pure knowledge differentfrom the many modifications due to contact and separation[^268]. Therefore he (Vyāsa)says “prakhyā(sva) rūpam hi cittasattvam[^269]”.

[^268]: "While the mind comes in contact with an object through the senses what remains is the pure knowledge of the object. There is no knowledge in the mind of the contact or separation. Thus the mind'sessential nature is that of knowledge."

[^269]: "The bhāsya reading in available texts is “cittarūpam"

 इदानीं वृत्तयो व्याख्यायन्ते।तासां चानेकत्वं रजस्तमसोरुद्भवाभिभवनिमित्तं विरुद्धत्वं चेत्याह—रजस्तमोभ्यांसंसृष्टं समप्रधानाम्यां यदा संसृष्टं तदानीं ऐश्वर्यविषयप्रियं भवति॥ प्रीतिः रागः, ऐश्वर्यविषयरागयुक्ता वृत्तयोभवन्तीत्यर्थः॥

 He now explains the (different) modifications of the mind. Their manifold nature



is caused by the rise and obstruction of the guṇas, rajas and tamas, which are of anopposite nature. Thus he says “rajastamobhyām saṃsṛṣṭam" i.e, when it is combinedwith (rajas and tamas) which are of equal importance, then "aiśvaryaviṣayapriyam bhavati” = it becomes fond of power and the objects of the senses.

 Fondness is attachment i.e., the modifications arise attached to power and to objects (possessions).

 तत्तमसानुविद्धं॥तदेव प्रख्यास्वरूपं चित्तं यदा गुणभूतरजस्केनोद्भूतेन तमसानुविद्धं, तदानीमधर्मादिचतुष्टयविषया वृत्तयः क्लिष्टा जायन्ते॥

“tattamasānuviddham[^270]';when that same mind of the nature of illumination is connected (pierced) with tamas which has arisen due to the quality of rajas becomingsubordinate then tainted modifications, having the fourfold objects like "adharma[^271]”,etc., come into being.

[^270]: "The available reading is tadevatamasānividdham' and not 'tattamasānuviddham'. The author of the Vivaraṇa seems to have many variant readings from what is now availableas theVyāsabhāsỵa."

[^271]: "They are adharma, ajñāna, avairāgya, and anaiśvarya."

 "tadeva prakṣīṇamohāvaraṇam" and so on. When the quality of tamas is subdued due to the decline of tamas, then like the sun which illumines everything on the passing away of the cloud (which was hiding it ), (the mind), "rajomātrayā” = connectedonly with a trace of rajas³undergoes good thoughts. Then there are the untaintedmodifications having the fourfold objects like "dharma", etc[^272].

[^272]: "They are dharma, jñāna, vairāgya, and aiśvarya.They are dharma, jñāna, vairāgya, and aiśvarya."

 यदा तदेव रजो\[लेश\]मलापेतं स्वरूपप्रतिष्ठं केवलेन स्वेन प्रख्यारूपेणावस्थितं, तदा सत्त्वपुरुषान्यताख्यातिमात्रं भवति। सत्त्वं चित्तं पुरुषो भोक्ता तयोरन्यता विविक्तता तत्ख्यातिः तदवगमः,तन्मात्रग्रहणंक्लेशाद्यभावप्रदर्शनार्थम।धर्ममेघध्यानोपगं भवति धर्ममेघो नामः समाधिः ॥

 And when that same mind "rajoleśamalāpetam svarūpapratiṣṭham"= has the lasttrace of rajas removed (and) is grounded only in its own nature of illumination, then“sattvapuruṣānyatākhyātimātram" ( it has the discriminate-discernment of the difference between the intellect and puruṣa )."sattvam" = the mind (intellect), "puruṣa" =the experiencer; i.e., there is the knowledge of the difference between the two. Theuse of the expression "only that" (only anyatākhyāti) is in order to indicate the absence of afflictions, etc. “dharmameghadhyānopagambhavati"-"dharmamegha” isthe name of that samādhi[^273].The mind gets rid of both rajas and tamas due to the powerof prasaṃkhyāna[^274]and through pure knowledge, perceiving only the true nature of  
———————————————————————————————————

[^273]: "The samadhi wherein anyatākhyāti comes about."

[^274]: "The other name for dharmamegha."

3\.

The word is "rajomātrayā” and the Vivaraṇakāra interprets it as rajolesena which is not justified. It is not a trace of rajas which is being mentioned but connection with the whole rajas as part of the composition of the mind.Or he has understood it as such from the next line in the bhāṣya.



puruṣa, remains in meditation called “prasaṃkhyānamityācakṣate dhyāyino"= prasaṃkhyāna by the yogīs.

 एवं वृत्तिस्वरूपे व्याख्याते तन्निरोधप्रदर्शनार्थमाह—चित्तशक्तिरित्यादि॥चितिरेव शक्तिः चितिशक्तिः।यथा पच्यादयः शक्तयः शक्तिमदपेक्षाप्रापणीयजन्मानो न स्वयंशक्तयः। चितिः पुनः स्वयमेव शक्तिः,नार्थान्तरमपेक्षते।

तेन नित्यावस्थितत्वम्।चितिशब्दस्य चिन्मात्राभिधायिनः शक्तिशब्देन सामानाधिकरण्यं अविकृतरूपायाएव चितेर्विषयित्वप्रदर्शनार्थम् ॥

 Thus, in this way, having explained the nature of the modifications, in order toindicate their restraint (restriction) he (Vyāsa) says “citiśaktiḥand so on. That whosepower is consciousness alone is “citiśaktiḥ". The power of cooking, etc., come intobeing, depending on the one who has the power ( of cooking) and are not in themselves the powers; ( whereas consciousness is not such a power). citiḥ= consciousness is a power in itself and it is not dependent on something else to manifest itselfand therefore it is eternally present. The use of the word 'citi' meaning pure consciousness in apposition (sāmānādhikaraṇya) to the word power (śakti) is in order toindicate that the possession of consciousness and consciousness are not different[^275].

[^275]: "The power and the possessor of power are not different. Consciousness is both."

 यस्मादेवमतोऽपरिणामिनी। व्यवस्थिते धर्मिणि धर्मान्तरतिरोभावेन धर्मान्तरप्रादुर्भावः परिणामः।न परिणमितुं शीलमस्या इत्यपरिणामिनी। अत एव अप्रतिसङ्क्रमा, परिणामिन एव चित्तादेविषयादौ प्रतिसङ्क्रमदर्शनात् ॥

 Because it is like that, therefore it is “apariṇāminī" = (without change).Change isthe coming into being of another quality at the disappearance of another (earlier) quality in an existing substance. The derivation of the word “apariṇāminī” is thatwhich does not have the nature to change'. And it is because of that, that it is“apratisaṅkramā" ( without movement), since it is seen that there is movement towards the various objects proceeding only from the mind and so on, which are of achangeful nature.

 अत एव दर्शितविषया दर्शितोऽन्तः करणेन विषयोऽस्या इति। तेनैव शुद्धा। अत एव अनन्ता देशतःकालतश्च। पूर्वपूर्वमुत्तरस्योत्तरस्य हेतुत्वेन द्रष्टव्यम्। वैधर्म्यदृष्टान्तः चित्तमिन्द्रियाणि च। सत्त्वगुणात्मिकासत्त्वमेव गुणः सत्त्वगुणः तस्येवात्मा स्वरूपमवभासो यस्याः सेयं सत्त्वगुणात्मिका अवभासस्वरूपेत्यर्थः।वृत्त्यविशिष्टवृत्तित्वाद्वा सत्वगुणात्मिकेत्युच्यते॥

 यदि वा ख्यात्या संबध्यते ख्यातिः सत्त्वगुणात्मिकेति।अतः चितिशक्तेरुक्तलक्षणाया विपरीता विलक्षणाविवेकख्यातिः परिणामादिमती॥

 And that is why it is “darśitaviṣayā” = i.e. that to which the object is presented bythe mind[^276].And thus it is “śuddhā" = pure; and therefore it is “anantā” = without end(limit) both in terms of space and time. One has to view each of the preceding (adjectives) as the cause for the succeeding one.

[^276]: "This is a view of the Vivaraṇakāra also hinted at by the Yogavārttikakāra. Cf. Rukmani, Yogavārttika of Vijñānabhikṣu, vol. I, p. 38"



 As examples of the opposite are the mind and the sense-organs. “Sattvaguṇātmikā"=that which is of the nature, essence, brightness of sattva-guṇa alone; i.e., it is of thenature of illumination (it illumines); or because it has a modification which is notdistinguished from the modification (pertaining to the object of the senses) it is“sattvaguṇātmikā". Or it is "sattvaguṇātmikā" because it is connected with knowledge and knowledge is of the nature of sattva. Thus discriminate-discernment whichis of the (above) said nature is “viparītā" = different from "citiśakti" and is of thenature of change.

 यस्मात् पुरुषादुत्कृष्टात् परिणामादिगुणविरहितान्निकृष्टापरिणामादिगुणयुक्ता,अतः सवरूपदोषदर्शनात्तस्यां विरक्तं अपरक्तं तामपि ख्यातिं आत्मनो निरुणद्धि॥

 Since it has qualities like change etc., it is inferior to the superior puruṣa which isdevoid of qualities like change; thus by perceiving its inherent defects, “tasyāmviraktam"=being detached from it, that knowledge of itself is also restricted[^277].

[^277]: "Its knowledge of the difference between itself and purușa is also restricted."

 “tadavastham"=in the state of total restraint, "saṃskāropagam" = there are onlythe subliminal-impressions left (in the mind). When the modifications are restrictedonly the subliminal-impressions which are generated by the modifications are left (inthe mind[^278]). The samādhi which is practised in that state of restriction is that which hasno seed—“sa nirbījah” i.e, in that state, the seeds in the form of afflictions and so on,have disappeared ( gone) i.e., all the seeds have decayed in this state. Therefore, he(Vyāsa) concludes that this sūtra[^279]is for the sake of only defining asaṃprajñāta samādhi(seedless-samādhi) (thus) sa *yogaścittavrṛttinirodhaḥ*.

[^278]: "Subliminal-impressions of anyatākhyāti."

[^279]: "VBh. on YS, I.2."

 तदवस्थे चेतसि स्वविषयाभावात् बुद्धिबोधात्मा पुरुषः किं स्वभाव इति—

 In that state of mind, since there is an absence of objects of the senses,what is thenature of 'puruṣa', which is the essence of knowledge of the intellect.

तदा द्रष्टुः स्वरूपेऽवस्थानम् ॥३॥

  At that time the seer abides in itself.

 स्वरूपप्रतिष्ठा तदानीं चितिशक्तिः,यथा कैवल्ये।व्युत्थानचित्ते तु सति तथापि भवन्ती न तथा ॥३॥

 At that time the power of consciousness abides in itself as in liberation. Whereas,when the mind is active, though it (citiśakti) is the same, it (does) not (seem) so.

 योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोध इत्युक्तं,तत्र बोद्धृत्वेनैव पुरुषसद्भावाधिगमः,विषयभूतवृत्तिनिरोधे च विषयिणोऽपिबोद्धुः पुरुषस्य निरोधं कश्चिदाशङ्केतापि, तथा स सति तत्कैवल्यप्राप्त्यपायस्यापि विवेकख्यातेरनर्थकत्वं

 The sūtra states that *yoga is the restriction of the modifications of the mind.* It isonly through the act of knowing, one knows the presence of puruṣa. When there isrestriction of the modifications (of the mind) which are of the objects, there would be someone who would suspect the restriction of purusa who is the knower, the one whopossesses the object of thought, also. In that case he might think that discriminate-discernment also, which is a means to kaivalya (liberation ) is useless and then (it will mean) that the instruction of yoga which is a means to kaivalya is also useless. Therefore with the desire to indicate the non-restriction of purușa, even when there is restriction of the modifications, and also directly indicating the fruit of knowledge he(Vyāsa) says "tadavasthe cetasi" and so on.[^280]"

[^280]: "'In that state of mind' and so on, which is the introduction to YS, 1.3."

 “tadavasthe" = in the state of restraint; “svaviṣayābhāvāt" = its object is the modification of the mind and because of its absence (in the state of restraint),“buddhibodhātmā” = the intellect changed into the form of modification (mental process) is known by it, therefore puruṣa is the knower of the intellect. Making knownthat (modification ) is the true nature of puruṣa; there is no other knower, and there isno other knowledge[^281].

[^281]: " both the knower and the act of knowing is the same here—they are synonymous. there is a word to word translation given here."

 In the event of the knower being different from knowledge, there will be change inhim. Then there cannot be the presentation of objects to him[^282]. And then the contingency of puruṣa depending on an instrument will arise[^283]. Therefore both the act ofknowing and the agency of knowing are spoken of figuratively by the expression‘vṛttisārūpya' (having the same form as themodification[^284]). Thus he (Patañjali) willsay *draṣṭā dṛśimātraḥ* and so on[^285]."). Thus he asks "what is the real being of that puruṣawhose nature is only that of making known knowledge[^286]."

[^282]: "Then puruṣa himself will see, which being an action, will mean that he is limited."

[^283]: "In order to know, puruṣa will have to depend on something which will make him subject to change.Cf. supra, n. 3."

[^284]: "Cf. YS, I.4."

[^285]: "YS, II.20. The seer is consciousness alone; though pure, he witnesses the modifications (of themind

 Is he of a perishable nature? Even if he is permanent what is his nature, and howdoes he come about? *tadā draṣṭuḥsvarūpévasthānam* i.e, when (all) the modifications are restricted “At that time, the power of knowing abides in itself” i.e., it abidesin itself (is the key word). “yathā kaivalye[^287]"(as in liberation). He will later describethe nature of permanence through the sūtras beginning with *na* *tatsvābhāsam**dṛśyatvāt*[^288] cannot illumine itself as it is an object fit to be known. These sūtras speak ofthe difference between the nature of the mind and that of puruṣa. In fact the description begins from YS,IV. 17 onwards.")?Its permanent nature being established, in order to remove one's doubt,he draws one's attention (to its nature ) by mentioning “svarūpapratiṣthā" and so on.

 Objection— But then, the sūtra is explained in emphatic terms (as if it is thus only).Then there is the (false) understanding that it does not abide in itself at other times.Otherwise the qualification used i.e., *tadā*, at that time (in the sūtra) will be useless. Incase it does not abide in itself at other times, then by having another state (at thosetimes), there will be the defect of its being subject to change.

 Answer—In order to remove that (doubt) he (Vyāsa) says “vyutthānacitte tu satitathāpi bhavantīna tathā[^289] is the same, it (does) not (seem) so.")".

[^289]: "VBh., under YS, I.3. When the mind is active, though it (citiśakti

 Through this he indicates 'its abiding in itself' at other times as well. The words“na tathā" (it does not seem so) draws attention to the fact that the adjective 'then'(*tadā* ) (in the sūtra) has (great significance).

 कथं तर्हि ? दर्शितविषयत्वात्—

 Why is it not so? (Why is it not the same in the active state)? Because objects are made known to it.

वृत्तिसारूप्यमितरत्र॥४॥

 At other times it has the same form as the modification (of the mind).

 

व्युत्थाने याः चित्तवृत्तयः तदविशिष्टवृत्तिः पुरुषः।तथा च सूत्रम्—“एकमेव दर्शनं ख्यातिरेवदर्शनम्” इति।चित्तम् अयस्कान्तमणिकल्पं सन्निधिमात्रोपकारि दृश्यत्वेन स्वं भवति पुरुषस्यस्वामिनः।तस्मात् चित्तवृत्तिबोधे पुरुषस्य अनादिसम्बन्धो हेतुः।

 Whatever modifications of the mind are present at the time of activity, the puruṣa has modifications not distinguished from those. Thus there is the sūtra (of Pañcasikhācārya) 'there is only one appearance, that appearance is knowledge. The mind



is like a magnet, by being fit to be seen and being useful by the mere fact of proximity, it becomes the property of puruṣa, the master.

 Therefore the reason for the puruṣa's knowledge of the modification of the mind is the beginningless relationship (with the mind).

 इतरस्तु तथापि भवन्तीत्यनेन चेत्स्वरूपप्रतिष्ठत्वमुच्यते, न तथेति च स्वरूपप्रतिष्ठत्वनिषेधश्चेदेकस्य वस्तुनस्तथाभावश्चातथाभावश्च विरुध्यत इति वीक्षापन्नः पृच्छति—कथं तर्हि इति॥इतर आह—वृत्तिसारूप्यमितरत्रेति॥ कस्मात् पुनर्वृत्तिसारूप्यम्? दर्शितविषयत्वात्॥ उभयत्र स्वरूपप्रतिष्ठत्वाविशेषेऽपि वृत्तिसारूप्यासारूप्यकृतो विशेष इति, न तथाभावातथाभावविरोधः॥

 "Though it is the same" by this statement if he is mentioning its abiding in itself and (then) by the words “it is not so" if he is denying the abiding in itself then,some say, that of the same substance there is a contradiction in saying that it is of its own nature' and ‘it is not of its own nature'. Therefore, in confusion, it is asked "how is this so”.[^290]")The answer is that we say (in reply)—At other times it has the same form as the modification (of the mind).[^291]

[^290]: "In the introduction to YS, I.4, Vyâsa asks “why is it not so (at other times

 Objection—But then, why is there the same form as the modification

[^291]: "YS, I.4."

 Answer—“darśitaviṣayatvât". Though in both places[^292] there is the abiding in oneself without any distinction, there is the difference created by 'having the same form as the modification' (in the state of activity) and not having the same form as the modification,(since there is no modification due to total restraint); thus there is no contradiction ( here) in being so and not being so.

[^292]: "At the time of activity and at the time of liberation."

 ननु च वृत्तिसारूप्ययोगे सति अवस्थान्तरयोगात् परिणामित्वादिदोषः प्राप्नोत्येव।न।दर्शितविषयत्वेन परिहृतत्वात्। चित्तवृत्त्यव्यारोपितं हि तत्,न स्वतः, स्फटिकाद्युपधानोपरागवत्।व्युत्थान इति॥निरोधादन्यत्र याश्चित्तस्य क्लिष्टादयो वृत्तयः ताभिरविशिष्य सदृशी वृत्तिः स्वरूपमस्य, चित्तवृत्तिव्यतिरेकेण स्वरूपव्यतिरेकेण च पुरुषस्य वृत्त्यभावात्, सदा ज्ञातविषयत्वे परिणामानुपपत्तेश्च॥

 Objection—But then, when it does have a form similar to that of the modification, it has another form; thus then it has the defect of being subject to change.

 Answer—That is not so. That is removed by the fact that it has (the objects) presented to it. That is a superimposition of the modification of the mind on it and not (a transformation) of itself; it is like the crystal taking on the colour of something resting near it.[^293]

 “vyutthâne” and so on. In states other than total restraint, “yâścittasya vṛttayaḥ" = (when there are) the modifications of the mind like tainted, etc., the puruṣa has its nature not different from (or similar to) those (modifications); without any modification of the mind and without its own nature, puruṣa cannot have any modification; and when he has the nature of always knowing the object, change cannot fit into (his nature).

[^293]: "The crystal does not change by taking on the colour of the object near it."

 तथा च पूर्वाचार्यसूत्रम् एकमेव दर्शनं—बुद्धिपुरुषयोः। किं तदित्याह—ख्यातिरेव दर्शनम् । बुद्धिवृत्तिरेव



 दर्शनम्। ख्यायते पुरुषेणेति च ख्यातिः ख्यायतेऽनया च बुद्धिपुरुषयोः स्वरूपमिति ख्यातिः।सैवार्थाकारोऽनया (कारतया) गृह्यत इति करणं, स्वेन च ख्यातिरूपेण गृह्यत इति कर्म च भवति। तथा दृश्यत इति दर्शनं,दृश्यतेऽनेनेति च,\[ज्ञायत इति ज्ञानं,\] ज्ञायतेऽनेनेति च सर्वमेवमादि द्रष्टव्यम् ॥

 Thus there is the sûtra by an earlier

preceptor[^294]

saying “ekameva darśanam" (there is only one sight) of buddhi and puruṣa. In answer to the question what is it he says—the sight is knowledge alone. The sight is only the modification of the intellect (mind). It is knowledge because it is known by puruṣa; and through this the true nature of buddhi and puruṣa are known, therefore it is knowledge.

[^294]: "Pañcaśikhâcârya."

 The object is grasped by it, it accomplishes the object, thus it is an instrument; and since by its own nature of the form of knowledge it grasps, it is also the

object.[^295]

Thus, because it is seen it is a sight, and because one sees through it also, it is a

[^295]: "Knowledge is both an instrument as well as an object when looked at in two different ways."

sight.[^296]

Similarly (that which is known is knowledge) and also that through which one knows is also knowledge. Thus all this has to be understood.

[^296]: "Here also it is being used both as an instrument and as an object."

 यत्तु ख्यातिकर्तृत्वे चित्तस्य तदेव ज्ञायते जानाति चेति (ज्ञानादितिचेति) ज्ञानान्तरकल्पनावैयर्थ्यप्रसङ्ग इति, तस्य ‘न तत्स्वाभासं दृश्यत्वात्' इत्यत्रैव परिहारं वक्ष्यामः॥

 Objection—But then, it is said that the mind has the capacity to give rise to knowledge and it is also known and also knows (due to knowledge); therefore there is no need to assume anything other than knowledge.

 Answer—The remedy will be mentioned in the sûtra. It cannot illumine itself as it is an object fit to be known.

⁴[^297]

 ननु च यदि चित्तपरिविजृम्भितमेवेदं सर्वं पुरुषश्चेदुदास्ते कथमसौ भोक्तेति ? न—कारकवैचित्र्यात्। कानिचिद्व्याप्रियमाणानि कारकाणि कानिचिद्व्यापारादृते सन्निधिमात्रेण कर्तृत्वं प्रतिपद्यन्ते॥

[^297]: "YS, IV. 19."

 यथा पचतीत्यधिश्रयणादिषु व्याप्रियमाणः पुरुषः कर्तेत्युच्यते। स्थाली सम्भवधारणाभ्यामव्याप्रियमाणैव पचतीत्युच्यते। तथा स्थालीमध्यगतमाकाशमवकाशं ददाति, न तस्य व्यापारं प्रतीमः॥

 Objection—If indeed all this is only an activity of the mind and puruṣa is just passive (indifferent ) how can he be the experiencer ?

 Answer—That is not so; the agents can be of different kinds. Some agents are directly the operating ones and some are the agents just by their mere presence, without any action.

 Similarly, in the act of cooking, the person who is engaged in the act of cooking is called the cook ( agent ). The pot, though not doing anything is called a cooker, by (just) existing and supporting (the rice). Thus the space in the pot gives space (for the rice to rise up) but we do not consider this as its activity.

 यथा च राजा दर्शनमात्रेणैव कर्ता। सर्वाणि च कारकाणि स्वेषु व्यापारेषु कर्तॄणि।न चादित्यः प्रकाशयन् करणान्तरमपेक्षते, व्याप्रियते व। न हि प्रकाशनमविद्यमानमुत्पादयति गमनादिवत्। प्रकाशात्मतैव हि तस्य सद्भावः, तथापि सन्निधिमात्रेण घटादीनां प्रकाशरूपेण अभिव्यक्तेः प्रकाशयतीत्युच्यते, एवमिहापि दृशिमात्रेण



पुरुषेण दृश्यानां चित्तवृत्तीनां चिदात्मना व्याप्यमानत्वात्, द्रष्टा पुरुष इतीममर्थं दर्शयति—चित्तमयस्कान्तमणिकल्पमिति॥

 Similarly a king, by the act of just appearing (before his people), is an agent. And all the agents (cited above) are agents of their own activities.The sun when it illumines other objects does not need any other instrument (for the act of illumination) nor does he act. Nor is illumination, that is not present, created like going (and coming ). His being is itself of the nature of illumination; even then by his mere presence, when there is the manifestation in the form of revealing the pot and so on, then it is said that it (the sun) illuminates (reveals). Here also, just by being the seer, the modifications of the mind that are the seen objects are pervaded by puruṣa, the consciousness (and) he is (called the) seer. Thus this sense is indicated by "cittamayaskântama

ṇikalpam"[^298]

and so on. (The mind is like a magnet.....)

[^298]: "VBh., under YS, I.4, cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. I, p. 43."

 

यस्याप्यात्ममनस्संयोगात् ज्ञानमुत्पद्यते, तस्यापि ज्ञानेन ज्ञेयं व्याप्नुवन्नात्मा ज्ञातेत्युच्यते, न व्याप्रियमाणः। ज्ञानम(स्या)पि गुणत्वे सति निष्क्रियत्वादात्मन एवार्थं दर्शयति। नापि क्रियानभ्युपगमात् जानातीत्यादि नोपपद्यते। ज्ञानेन हि ज्ञेयं व्याप्नुवन् जानातीत्युच्यते॥

 Even in the case of

one[^299]

who believes that knowledge arises by the conjunction of the âtman and the mind, the âtman is said to be the knower by the pervasion of the object known by knowledge, and not by engaging in any activity. Knowledge being its (âtman's) quality (in his view) it is without action; therefore, it shows (reveals) the object. It cannot be said that since there is no activity it will not be proper to say that it knows, etc. It is by pervading the known by knowledge that it knows.

[^299]: "The Naiyâyika who believes in this theory of knowledge."

 किं चान्यत्—आत्ममनस्संयोगादपूर्वज्ञानोत्पत्तौ सत्यामात्मनस्तज्ज्ञानं,न मनसः।आत्मैव जानाति, न मन इति को हेतुर्भवेत् ? अथापि स्यात्—आत्मनः समवायिकारणत्वादिति। नैतदेवं,असिद्धत्वात्।यथैव ज्ञानमात्मन इति साध्यं,एवमात्मन एव समवायिकारणत्त्वं न मनस इति साध्यम्, अनात्मस्वरूपत्वे सत्युभयसंयोगजत्वाभ्युपगमात्॥

 Moreover, there is this additional point. When there is this unique knowledge arising due to the contact between the âtman and the mind, the knowledge belongs to âtman and not to the

mind.[^300]

It is the âtman which knows and not the mind—what is the reason for that?

[^300]: "He is discussing the Nyâya theory of knowledge and pointing out its defects."

 Objection—This is because the âtman is the inherent

cause[^301]

(Samavâyîkâraṇa).

[^301]: "Like the threads and the cloth."

 Answer—This cannot be so, as it is not established. Just as it has to be proved that knowledge is an attribûte of âtman so also it has to be proved that only the âtman is the inherent cause and not the mind,

⁵[^302]

as it is admitted that the mind is not the âtman and that it (knowledge ) arises in the contact of both.

[^302]: "There are far too many assumptions without proof."

⁶[^303] the property is supposed to be present in both the things connected. Thus knowledge should belong to both and not to the âtman alone.")

[^303]: "In saṃyoga (contact



 अथापि स्यात्—ज्ञानाहितसंस्कारस्यात्म\[नः\]स्मृत्येककर्तृत्वेन प्रतिसन्धानदर्शनादिति—न—तस्यापि साध्यत्वात्। तत्रापि ज्ञानसंस्कारस्मृतिप्रतिसन्धानादीन्यात्मन एव, न मनस इति साधनीयानि। फलेन समानाश्रयत्वादिच्छादीनामिति चेत्—न—तत्रापि तुल्यत्वात्। संयोगजत्वे सत्यात्मनः फलेच्छादीनि, न मनस इति दुःसाधमेव॥ (दुःसाध्यमेव )॥

 Objection—Moreover this could be because, in recollection, one sees that the âtman is the sole agent of memory, having the subliminal–impressions put in by knowledge.

 Answer—But that is not correct, for that also has to be proved. Even there it has to be proved that knowledge, subliminal–impressions, memory and recollection, etc.,all belong to the âtman and not to the mind.

 Objection—It is argued that it is so because both

desire[^304] is a quality of the âtman in the Nyâya system.")

[^304]: "Desire (icchâ

and its result (knowledge) belong to the same locus.

 Answer—Even then it cannot be as the argument is the same there

also.[^305]

When it (knowledge) is produced by conjunction, it is difficult to prove that desire and its result belong to the âtman and not to the mind.

[^305]: "It has still to be proved."

 

किं चास्य ज्ञानस्यापि ज्ञेयत्वाभ्युपगमादनवस्थाप्रसङ्गः।न हि ज्ञानमन्येन करणभूतेन ज्ञानेन विज्ञातुं शक्यं,तदप्यन्येन तदप्यन्येनेत्यनिष्टप्रसङ्गात्॥

 अथानवस्थाप्रसङ्गपरिहाराय दूरमपि गत्वा किंचिज्ज्ञानमाद्यं वा ज्ञानान्तरेण न गृह्यते स्वयमात्मनैव गृह्यत इति,तथा ज्ञानवदर्थस्यापि स्वयं ग्रहणप्रसङ्गः॥

 Moreover, since this knowledge is also accepted as an object of knowledge (according to the Naiyâyika) there will be the unwanted result of infinite regress. One knowledge cannot be known by another knowledge as its instrument, then that also by another then that also by another and so on, endlessly.

 Then in order to get rid of the defect of infinite regress,if one concedes that at some point or at the beginning itself, the knowledge is not grasped by another knowledge but is grasped by itself (âtman), then, similar to knowledge, the object, also will be able to be grasped by itself.

 अथ दीपवत् स्वयमवभासते चावभासयति च अवभासात्मकत्वात्,अर्थस्यानवभासात्मकत्वाददोष इति चेत्—तथापि प्रकाशस्वरूपेष्वर्थेषु विज्ञानेनाग्रहणप्रसङ्गः॥

 अथ ज्ञानस्यात्मसमवेतत्वाभासनरूपाभ्यां स्वयं ग्रहणं, बहिः प्रकाशात्मकानां तु ज्ञानविपरीतधर्मत्वाददोष इति चेत्—तच्चन—यदि चात्मसमवेतत्वं प्रकाशात्मकत्वं च ज्ञानस्य स्वयंग्रहणे हेतुः स्यात् सर्वे सर्वज्ञाः प्राप्नुवन्ति॥

 Objection—Then it is said that like a lamp it illumines itself and also illumines other things, as it has the nature of illumination; and since the objects do not have the nature of illumination there is no defect (in this argument).

 Answer—Even then it will not be possible to grasp through knowledge such objects which have the nature of brightness (like gold, etc.).

 Objection—Then it is said that knowledge reveals itself through the inherence of âtman and through its nature of illumination, and the outside objects that have



brightness (like gold, etc.) have a quality different from knowledge; therefore,there is no defect (in the above argument).

 Answer—It is not right to say so. If the inherence of âtman and the nature of illumination of knowledge is the reason for its grasping itself then (it will result in) everyone becoming

omniscient.[^306]

 

[^306]: "This is not so, as seen in the world."

अथ ग्राह्याकारत्वमपि कारणं चेत्—तच्च न;अन्यस्य ज्ञानस्यान्याकारतया करणत्वं यथा, तथा ज्ञानस्यापि ग्राह्यस्यान्याकारेणान्यदेव ज्ञानं करणं स्यात्, तथा चानवस्था दुष्परिहरैव॥

 Objection—Moreover, it can be said that the form of the perceived object also is a cause (in knowledge).

 Answer—It cannot be so; just as knowledge which is different has its cause which has another form (from the object), similarly the knowledge (which is grasped) having another form, will have another knowledge as its instrument; and thus the infinite regress will be difficult to get rid of.

 

किं चान्यत्—न हि कश्चित् स्वयंग्राह्यग्राहकत्वप्रसाधनाय दृष्टान्तो विद्यते, प्रदीपस्यापि चक्षुरादिग्राह्यत्वात्। न चाप्यंशद्वयमस्ति ज्ञानस्य, निरवयवत्वात्। सत्यपि चांशद्वये तयोः प्रकाशात्मकत्वान्नान्योन्यग्राह्यग्राहकभावः प्रदीपयोरिव द्वयोः॥

 Moreover there is this additional point—there is no example which illustrates the capacity to be both itself the knower and the known since even in the case of light it is grasped by the eyes and so on. And again knowledge has not got these two parts since it is without parts. Even if it is conceded that it is of two parts then, since both have the nature of illumination, they cannot have the relationship of knower and known as in the case of two

lamps.[^307]

 

[^307]: "As both have the same characteristic of illumination, the two lamps do not have the relationship of illuminator and illuminated between them."

किं चान्यत्—ज्ञानस्य ग्राह्यग्राहकत्वाभ्युपगमे सत्यात्मसद्भावोऽपि दुस्सम्पाद एव। तस्मादर्थाकारज्ञानस्मृतिप्रतिसन्धानप्रयत्नेच्छादीनामनात्मधर्मत्वं ग्राह्यत्वात् रूपादीनामिव।परार्थत्वाच्च सङ्घाताश्रयत्वं रूपादिनिदर्शनेनैव। तथा आश्रयवत्त्वादनित्यत्वाच्च प्रयत्नपूर्वकत्वाच्चेत्येवमादिभ्योऽनात्मधर्मत्वसिद्धिः॥

 Moreover there is this additional point—if one accepts the twofold nature of being both the knower and the known then it will become difficult to accept the very being of âtman; then it will be said that the object, knowledge, memory, recollection, effort, desire, etc.,all have the quality of being 'not-self' (anâtma) as they are known like shape (colour),etc.And as ( all these) serve the purpose of another, they are dependent on each other as a collection, as is pointed out by the example of form.Thus, because of dependence and because of impermanence and because it comes about through effort—because of all these reasons, there is establishment of the 'not-self'.

³[^308]


[^308]: "The Vivaraṇkâra mentions how the acceptance of the dual nature of knowledge can lead to this result."


अयस्कान्तमणिकल्पम्॥अयस्कान्तमणिरिव। यथा अयस्कान्तमणिरयसः स्वात्मव्याप्तिं प्रत्युपकरोति सन्निधिमात्रेण,तथा चित्तमपि चित्स्वरूपस्यात्मनः स्वात्मव्याप्तिं प्रत्युपकरोति दृश्यत्वेन॥



नर्तकीव दर्शितविषयत्वादन्तः कऱणेनेत्युक्तम्।

 “ayaskântamaṇikalpam" = like a magnet. Just as a magnet, by its mere presence, favours the iron filings by pervasion of its own nature, similarly, the mind also favours the âtman of pure consciousness by pervasion of its nature, by being an object. Thus it is said that just like a dancer,he has the objects presented to him, by the internal organ.

 तत्र दर्शयितृत्वं चित्तस्य द्रष्टृत्वं च पुरुषस्य किंकृतम् ? स्वस्वामित्वकृतम्। कथं पुनः स्वस्वामित्वम् ? वस्तुस्वभावत्वात्। कथमिति चेदुक्तं—चित्तमयस्कान्तमणिकल्पमिति॥ अथ चित्तवृत्तीनां बोधे को हेतुः पुरुषस्येति ? उच्यते—यस्मादेवं सन्निधिमान्नोपकारि चित्तं दृश्यत्वेन, तस्माच्चित्तवृत्तीनां बोधे पुरुषस्य अयं हेतुः भवति, योऽसौ अनादिसम्बन्धः॥४॥

 In this context, why does the presenting (of objects) belong to the mind and knowing (seeing) belong to the puruṣa—(that is) because of the relationship between what is possessed and the possessor (property and master). Why is there this relationship between the owned and the owner (of property)—because that is the nature of a substance. If it is asked— how is this possible—he says “cittamayaskântamanikalpam" and so

on.[^309]

 Then what is the cause for the knowledge of the modifications of the mind by puruṣa ? He says—thus, in this way, “sannidhimâtropakâri drśyatvena" the mind, by being fit to be seen and being useful by its mere proximity is the "puruṣasya bodhe hetuh” = cau.

[^309]: "VBh., under YS, I.4."

se for puruṣa 's knowledge of the modifications of the mind; and this “anâdisaṃbandhaḥ" = is a beginningless relationship.

 ताः पुनर्निरोद्धव्या बहुत्वे सति चित्तस्य—

 Moreover, those (modifications) of the mind, though many, are to be restricted.

वृत्तयः पञ्चतय्यः क्लिष्टाऽक्लिष्टाः॥५॥

 The modifications are of five types and they are afflicted and non-afflicted (respectively).

 क्लेशहेतुकाः कर्माशयप्रचये क्षेत्रीभूताः किष्टाः।ख्यातिविषया गुणाधिकारविरोधिन्योऽक्लिष्टाः।क्लिष्टप्रवाहपतिता अप्यक्लिष्टाः क्लिष्टच्छिद्रेष्वप्यक्लिष्टा भवन्ति।अक्लिष्टच्छिद्रेषु किष्टा इति।तथाजातीयकाः संस्कारा वृत्तिभिरेव क्रियन्ते।संस्कारैश्च वृत्तय इति। एवं वृत्तिसंस्कारचक्रमनिशमावर्तते।तदेवंभूतं चित्तमवसिताधिकारमात्मकल्पेन व्यवतिष्ठते प्रलयं वा गच्छतीति॥५॥

 The afflicted are those caused by afflictions and are the fields for the accumulation of the deposit of 'karma'; the non-afflicted have discriminate-discernment as their object and oppose the sway of the guṇas.

 The non-afflicted are also those which occur in the stream of the afflicted; for, even in the midst of the afflicted, there are non-afflicted (modifications), and in the midst of the non-afflicted there are afflicted (modifications). Only through the modifications arise corresponding subliminal-impressions and through subliminal-impres-



sions the modifications (are produced). Thus the wheel of modifications and subliminal-impressions revolves ceaselessly. The mind which is of this kind, when its work is finished, either stays indistinguished from the self or is absorbed (in prakṛti).

 

ताःपुनर्निरोद्धव्याःबहुत्वेऽपि सति चित्तस्य याभिर्वृत्तिभिः व्युत्थाने सारूप्यमुक्तं पुरुषस्य। कस्मात् पुनः निरोद्धव्या इत्याह—यतो वृत्तयःक्लिष्टाक्लिष्टाः॥

 "tâḥ punarniroddhavyâḥ bahutve pi sati

cittasya"[^310]

= those modifications during activity, through which the oneness of puruṣa (with them) is mentioned (they are to be restricted). Why are they to be restricted ? (In answer to that ) he says because The modifications are afflicted and non-afflicted.

[^310]: "'The reading in Vyāsa is "

 ननु च बहुत्वे सति न शक्या निरोद्धुमित्यत आह—पञ्चतय्य इति यद्यपि क्लिष्टाक्लिष्टा वृत्तयोऽनन्ताः, तथापि पञ्चतय्यः पञ्चविधाः, पञ्चकुला एव। ततश्च पञ्चप्रकारवृत्तिप्रतिपक्षभूताभ्यासवैराग्यप्रयोगादेव निरोधोपपत्तेः प्रत्यवयवनिरोधसाधनाप्रयोजकत्वाद्वृत्तीनां तद्बहुत्वे न निरोधाशक्यत्वप्रसङ्गः

 Objection—But then, if they are too many it will not be possible to restrict (them all); therefore he says they are of five types. Though the afflicted and non-afflicted modifications are without end still they are pañcatayyaḥ = of five kinds, of five types only.

 And then it is proper that the five types of modifications be restricted by the practice of detachment and continued application (of restriction); the question is not that if they are too many there will be the difficulty of not being able to restrict them; but that there is no useful purpose served in restriction of each one of the parts of the modific

ations.[^311]

 क्लेशहेतुकाः—क्लेशनिमित्ताः। अविद्यादिपञ्चक्लेशप्रयुक्तं हि चित्तं वृत्तिभिरात्मानं पुनः पुनरावेदयति।कर्माशयप्रचये कर्माणि कुशलाकुशलविमिश्राणि तान्येवाऽऽफलप्रदानाच्छेरत इति कर्माशयशब्दवाच्यानि,तेषां प्रचय इतरेतरगुणप्रधानभावेन संहननं, तस्मिन् कर्माशयप्रचये निमित्ते, अविद्यादिक्षेत्रीभूताः क्लिष्टाश्रया इत्यर्थः। सतीषु हि तासु कर्माशयो विपाकाभिमुखीभवति॥

[^311]: "The restriction is general through the two means of detachment and continued practice of restriction. It is not directed towards each one of the modifications as that does not serve any purpose."

 “kleśahetukâḥ” = those caused by afflictions.The mind connected with the five afflictions beginning with avidyâ,

3[^312]

informs the âtman through the modifications, repeatedly.

[^312]: "Cf. YS, III.3–9."

 “karmâśayapracaye" = the actions are good, bad and mixed; they stay (remain) till such time as they yield their fruit; therefore they are denoted by the word "deposit of karma"; their accumulation is their compactness in a state of mutual relationship as primary and subsidiary. When that accumulation of the deposit of karma is the cause, then ‘avidyâ’, etc.,“kṣetrîbhûtâḥ = become dependent on the afflictions. And when they (the afflictions) are present the 'deposit of karma' works towards yielding its fruit.

⁴[^313]


[^313]: "Cf. YS, II.13. Vipâka is the result of karma and are jâti, âyuḥ and bhogaḥ."


 

ख्यातिविषयाः—ख्यात्यास्पदाः।गुणानां सत्त्वादीनाम् अधिकारः संस्कारप्रवृत्तिः तद्विरोधिन्यः। ख्यातिविषयत्वादेव ता अक्लिष्टाः, अपवर्गहेतुत्वात्॥

 “khyâtiviṣayâḥ” = having their basis in knowledge; they "guṇâdhikâravirodhinyaḥ" = are (opposed to) the activity based on the subliminal-impressions of the sattva and other guṇas. They are non-afflicted because of having knowledge as their object i.e., due to their being the cause for liberation.

 Objection—When non-afflicted modifications (thoughts ) arise in the midst of afflicted modifications, do they also become afflicted as in the case of drops of water thrown into a pot of

milk.[^314]

In a similar way, when afflicted modifications rise in the flow of non-afflicted modifications do they also becorne non-afflicted? Then what is the result? If the non-afflicted rising in the flow of afflicted (thoughts ) become afflicted then (there will be difficulty in) memory conforming to the subliminal-impressions of the modifications (thoughts) and activity conforming to that (memory), for that will not happen when there is a change in one's

[^314]: "This example is interesting—the age old practice of adding water to milk is perhaps humorously referred to."

nature.[^315]

 Answer—Therefore he (Vyâsa) says—“kliṣṭacchidreṣvapyakliṣṭâḥ” = i.e, they remain non-afflicted (even in that stream of afflicted thoughts), and similarly “akliṣṭacchidreṣu" even in the midst of non-afflicted, "kliṣṭâ" = they remain afflicted. That is why “tathâjâtîyakâḥ saṃskârâ vṛttibhireva kriyante" = through the modifications arise corresponding subliminal-impressions.

[^315]: "Non-afflicted becoming afflicted will violate the rule of correspondence between action. subliminal-impression and memory."

 

यद्यपि क्लेशादयोऽपि संस्कारमारभन्ते, तथापि वृत्तिद्वारैव तेषामपि संस्कार इति वृत्तिभिरेवेत्येवकारार्थः। तथा संस्कारैरपि वृत्तयः स्वानुरूपं क्रियन्त इत्येवं—वृत्तिसंस्कारचक्रमनिशमनवरतमावर्तते।तदेवंभूतं चित्तं—एवं हेतुहेतुमद्वृत्तिसंस्कारधर्मकम्। अवसिताधिकारं—निवृत्ताविद्याहेतुप्रवृत्तिकं हेतुमात्रावस्थत्वात्।आत्मकल्पेन—पुरुषकल्पेन ख्यातिमात्रेणैव कञ्चित्कालमवतिष्ठते— प्रारब्धसंस्कारशेषानुवृत्त्या। प्रलयं वा गच्छति—संस्कारावसानादिति॥ ५ ॥

 Even though the afflictions give rise to subliminal-impressions still their subliminal-impressions are (produced) only through modifications (of the mind); that is the significance of the word "eva" in the word "vṛttibhireva".Similarly "saṃskâraiḥ"= through the subliminal impressions,"vṛttayaḥ" there are modifications of the mind which conform to their nature.In this way "vṛttisaṃskâracakramaniśamâvartate”= the wheel of modifications and subliminal-impressions keep revolving ceaselessly.

 "tadevaṃbhûtam cittam" = the mind is of such a nature having the relationship of cause and effect through modifications (of the mind) and ( its ) subliminal-impressions.



 “avasitâdhikâram" = when it (mind ) stops activity due to the afflictions avidyâ, etc., ceasing (to operate); i.e., because it stays only in its causal

 These afflicted and non-afflicted modifications are of five types.

प्रमाणविपर्ययविकल्पनिद्रास्मृतयः॥६॥  

प्रत्यक्षानुमानागमाः प्रमाणानि॥७॥

 Correct knowledge, misapprehension, mental construction, sleep and memory (are the five kinds of modifications)

 Sources of true knowledge are perception, inference and what has come down ( from time immemorial) (Vedas), (utterances of a trustworthy person).

 यस्याश्रद्वेयार्थो वक्त्र न दृष्टानुमितार्थः स आगमः प्लवते। मूलवक्तरि तु दृष्टानुमितार्थेनिर्विप्लवः स्यात्॥ ६-७॥

 That modification of the mind which, by being connected with an outside object through the channel of the sense-organs and making that object its own, mainly comprehends the special nature of the object which has general and special characteristics, is the source of correct knowledge (called) perception.

 The result (of perception) is the knowledge of the modification of the mind as belonging to puruṣa, which is identical (with the modification of the mind). 'Puruṣa is conscious by reflection' thus we will explain later.



 That modification of the mind, which mainly comprehends the general characteristic of the inferred object and which refers to that relation which is present in things belonging to the same class as the subject (in which the object is to be inferred) and absent from things belonging to a different class from the subject (in which the object is to be inferred), is inference. Thus, for instance, 'the moon and stars possess motion because of movement from one place to another, like Caitra; and the Vindhya is without motion because it does not move from one place to another.'

 In order to transfer one's own knowledge of a thing which has been seen or has been inferred by a trustworthy person, words are used. The modification (of the mind) of the hearer, which is due to that word and which has that (the object intended by the word) as the object is (the source of knowledge called) the Word (Scriptures). The word of one, who is untrustworthy, because he has not seen or inferred the object is contradicted, whereas when the original speaker himself has seen or inferred a thing, that word is not contradicted.

 In answer to the question as to what are these fivefold afflicted and non-afflicted modifications (of the mind) he (Patañjali) says pramâṇaviparyayavikalpanidrâsmṛt

ayaḥ.[^320]

The modifications are all included in the (above five). In that context the modification known as valid (true) knowledge is divided into three types as pratyakṣânumânâgamâḥ pramâ

[^320]: "YS, 1.6."

ṇâni[^321]

(perception, inference and utterances of trustworthy persons).

[^321]: "YS, 1.7."

 Of the modification of the mind known as true knowledge, the first is direct perception. He therefore gives its definition first, since it precedes the other two

divisions.[^322]

"indriyapraṇâḍikayâ" = here the sense-organ stands for (the five organs of knowledge) like the sense of hearing,

[^322]: "Inference and trustworthy persons' utterances assume this. Thus it is prior to the other two."

etc.[^323]

and not the (five) organs of

[^323]: "The other four being sense of touch, sight, taste and smell. The Vivaraṇakâra uses “praṇâḍikayâ"

action,[^324]

as they do not cause the modification of the

[^324]: "They are vâk, pâṇi, pâda, upâyu, and upasthâ."

mind,[^325]

and they are meant only for actions. Thus, even though the word sense-organ is used in a general sense, since he desires to explain the modifications of the mind, they refer to the sense-organs of hearing, etc.;

[^325]: "The five organs of knowledge by hearing, touching, seeing, tasting, and smelling, are directly connected with the modifications and the subliminal-impressions."



the sense of hearing, etc., are also meant for the sake of 'producing' the modifications ( of the mind).

 The sense-organ of knowledge itself is the channel, doorway,in the form of modifications like sound, etc., for the changeful mind. Thus, the mind, through that senseorgan is changed into the form of the outside object,both in its particular and general nature,and is coloured by it. And because of that colouring, the modification of the mind which is like the counter-seal of a seal,though coloured by the general and special characteristics of the object,mainly “viśeṣâvadhâranapradhânâ" = comprehends the special nature of the object.That alone is true knowledge known as direct perception.



अथ स्वविषयसामान्यविशेषावभासनसामर्थ्ये श्रोत्रादीनां चित्तस्य च किंकृतं विशेषावधारणप्राधान्यमिति ?

 उच्यते—विशेषप्रतिबन्धत्वात् हानोपादानादीनां विशेषावधारणप्रधानतेति (तेत्याह)। न सामान्यं नावधार्यते, गुणभूतं तु गृह्यत एव।

 यथा नीलं रूपमिति नीलावधारणप्राधान्ये सत्यपि रूपमेव नीलमिति गुणभूतमवधारयति। तथा दुःखशब्दः सुखशब्दो मूढः शब्द इति। तथा च विशेषावधारणप्रधाना वृत्तिरिति ह्युपपद्यते॥

 Objection—But then, when the sense of hearing, etc., have the capacity to reveal both the general and special characteristics of its object, why does the mind comprehend only the special characteristic?

 Answer—As there is an inseparable connection with the special characteristic in rejection and acceptance, it is said that there is comprehension mainly of the special characteristic.It is not that the general characteristic is not comprehended,it is grasped as being subordinate, (as being a quality ). When one says 'blue colour', though there is the understanding of the primary object i.e., the blue colour, it is comprehended under the form of a colour as 'the colour is blue' i.e., in a secondary sense (as being a quality). Similarly when one uses the expressions 'painful word','pleasurable word and oppressive word' (by the words duhkha, etc., the sâmânya is conveyed).Thus it is proper to understand that this (pratyakṣa) modification mainly comprehends the particular characteristic.

 

किं च—संशयविपर्ययनिमित्तत्वाच्च सामान्योपलब्धेः।सामान्ये ह्युपलब्धे बुभुत्सितविशेषस्य संशयो जायते, समुपलब्धसामान्यान्यस्मृतेर्वा विपर्ययः,समधिगतविशेषस्य तु संशयविपर्ययौ न स्थितिमुपारनुवाते, इति विशेषावधारणप्रधानतोच्यते॥

 

यत्रापि सामान्यमेवावदिधारयिषितं गौरिति वा अश्व इति वा,तत्राप्यन्यतरपरित्यागेनान्यतरावधारणेति विशेषावधारणप्रधानतैव। सर्वमेव हि वस्तु वस्त्वन्तरापेक्षया सामान्यं विशेषश्च॥

 There is this additional point—the general characteristics can also be the causes for doubt and illusion. When the general characteristic is seen there is doubt regarding the particular characteristic desired to be known; and illusion is another memory of a general characteristic seen (elsew

here);[^326]

whereas the particular characteristic known directly does not admit of doubt or illusion; therefore it is said that (direct perception) comprehends mainly the special characteristic (of an object).

[^326]: "While general characteristics give rise to all this, direct perception cannot."

 Even where one desires to know only the general characteristic as in the examples



‘this is a cow’, ‘this is a horse', etc., there also by discarding some (characteristic) there is an emphasis on some other (characteristic), and thus it is a comprehension mainly of the special characteristic. It is known after-all, that everything with reference to everything else is both an universal and a particular.

 

यस्य पुनः सामान्यमवस्त्वध्यारोपितमेवोषराम्बुवत्,नेन्द्रियविषयमिति,तस्य प्रतिनियतसामान्याध्यारोपणानुपपत्तिः।न ह्यनुपलब्धपूर्वमुख्ये संभवत्यध्यारोपणा, स्मृत्यसंभवात्। न कदाचिददृष्टमुख्योदकस्य सलिलाध्यारोपणमूषरेषु विद्यते।

 One can believe that all general characteristics (universals) are superimposed like water in a barren, saline spot ( desert), and it is not the object of the sense-organs.

 Answer—It will be difficult to explain the superimposition of specific universals.[^327]


[^327]: "There is the perception of only certain fixed universals like horns in a cow and not in a horse. This cannot be explained by a general theory of superimposition."


It is not possible to superimpose anything on to something which has not been experienced before, as there is no possibility of memory of it. It is not possible to superimpose water on to deserts (as is done in mirages) in case one has not seen water before.

 

अथास्मरन्नप्यध्यारोपयेत् रूपस्वलक्षणे शब्दत्वाद्यप्यध्यस्येत्। अथेन्द्रियान्तरविषयत्वाद्रूपस्वलक्षणे शब्दत्वाद्यध्यासो विरुद्ध इति चेत्—न—अवस्तुत्वे सत्यविशेषात्। विशेषाभ्युपगमे च वस्तुत्वप्रसङ्गः। शब्दस्वलक्षणादिव रूपस्वलक्षणस्य॥

 Objection—One can say that even without memory it is possible to superimpose (something on to something else).

 Answer—Then one can also superimposc sound, etc., on to something which has the characteristic of colour.

 Objection—But the characteristic of colour being the object of another sense-organ its superimposition on something having sound is a contradiction.

 Answer—There is no distinction between objects that do not

exist.[^328]

And if you admit special characteristics (distinct particulars) then you will have the problem of admitting real entities; thus the colour characteristic is as real as the sound characteri

stic.[^329]

 

[^329]: "This is in answer to the Buddhist opponent who does not believe in any real entity."

किं चान्यत्—देशकालान्यविशिष्टप्रत्यक्षा\[न\]भ्युपगमे समस्तलोकव्यवहारविलापःस्यात्।न हीदमहममुष्मिन्नवकारो काले चास्मिन्नद्राक्षमेतस्मान्निमित्तादेवंविशेषणमिति च स्मृत्युपपत्तिः।न च प्रत्यक्षादृष्टेषु विशेष्यवद्विशेषणेषु स्मृतिः संभवति।न च कल्पनापोढेन व्यवहारगोचरातीतेन व्यवहरमाणो दृश्यते।तस्माल्लोकप्रसिद्धप्रत्यक्षानुसरणमेव न्याय्यम्॥

 Moreover there is this additional point—If one does not admit direct perception as qualified by space, time and other characteristics there will be denial of the entire day-to-day existence. Then there cannot be an experience like 'I saw this on that occasion and at that time and so there is this memory of the special quality.'And without direct perception there cannot also be memory of qualities as there cannot be memory of subjects (having them). No one sees anyone functioning through fancy



which is beyond everyday

life.[^330]

Therefore it is logical to accept direct perception as it is commonly understood in the world.

[^330]: "The Buddhist theory of everything being 'kalpanâpoḍham' is being attacked."

 

ननु च योगिनां निर्विकल्पसमाधिजं दर्शनं,तस्यानेवंलक्षणत्वात्,तथा सुखरागादिविज्ञानस्य चानिन्द्रियप्रनाडीपूर्वत्वात् प्रमाणान्तरत्वमभ्युपेतव्यं, प्रत्यक्षत्वं वा वक्तव्यम्।उच्यते।प्रत्यक्षस्य (न प्रमाणस्य) पुरुषप्रत्ययापेक्षत्वेन परिहृतत्वात्।न ह्यंप्रत्यया वृत्तिः प्रत्यक्षम्। चैतन्योदयहेतोरेव सप्रत्ययायाः प्रत्यक्षत्वम्।तथा चाह—'फलं तदविशिष्टः पौरुषेयश्चित्तवृत्तिबोध' इति॥एवं च सति सुखरागादिज्ञानस्य क्लिष्टाक्लिष्टरूपस्य तदविशिष्टपुरुषप्रत्ययफलावसानत्वात् प्रत्यक्षता सिद्धैव॥

 Objection—But then, the yogîs have insight which comes about due to seedless-samâdhi, (and) that is not of this character. Similarly, the knowledge of pleasure, attachment, etc., is not through the channel of a sense-organ; so one has to look for their origin in some other means of true knowledge or it has to be mentioned as direct

perception.[^331]

 Answer—In the case of direct perception the difficulty can be avoided by saying that it depends on the knowledge of purusa (as) direct perception is not a modification without knowledge. It is because of the rise of consciousness that direct perception has knowledge (as its characteristic).

[^331]: "In that case the definition of direct perception will have to be changed."

 Thus it is said “phalam ( tad) aviśiṣṭaḥ pauruṣeyaścittavṛttib

odhaḥ"[^332]

(The result is the knowledge of the modification of the mind as belonging to puruṣa, which is identical with it). When this is so the knowledge of pleasure, attachment, etc.,whether afflicted or non-afflicted, culminating in the result of knowledge of puruṣa, as indistinguished from them, establishes their being direct perception.

[^332]: "The word “tad"

 इन्द्रियप्रनाडिकाग्रहणं लौकिकप्रत्यक्षोद्भवानुवाद एव। अन्यथा हीन्द्रियनिरपेक्षस्य योगीश्वरयोर्ज्ञानस्याप्रत्यक्षता स्यात्। अस्ति हि क्लेशादिप्रतिबन्धाभावे सर्वार्थेन चित्तसत्त्वेन सर्वविषयेण युगपत्सूक्ष्मव्यवहितादिग्रहणम्।तथा चाह—'तारकं सर्वविषयं सर्वथाविषयमक्रमं चेति विवेकजं ज्ञानम्' इति। तस्मान्नावधार्यते इन्द्रियप्रनाडिकयैवेति॥

 बाह्यवस्तूपरागादिति विपर्ययनिवृत्त्यर्थम्। विशेषावधारणप्रधानत्वेन संशयनिवृत्तिरिति॥

 The acceptance of the channel of the sense-organs is only an explanation of the way direct perception takes place in the world.

 Otherwise the direct perception of yogîs and Îśvara, which is without any dependence on the senses, will not be called as direct perception.

 When there is the absence of the obstruction of the afflictions then the sattva-mind is able to grasp simultaneously all objects in all its aspects including the subtle and hidden aspects. Thus it is said 'târakam sarvaviṣayam sarvathâviṣayamakraman ceti vivekajam

jñânam'.[^333] it has all times (past, present and future ) as its object, and it is without succession.")

[^333]: "YS, III.54. Knowledge which is born of insight is a deliverer, it has all objects as its sphere of action, (all-comprehensive

Therefore it should not be understood that (direct perception ) is only through the path of the sense-organs.

 "bâhyavastûparâgât” has been used in order to exclude misapprehension. By saying 'having mainly the comprehension of the special characteristic', doubt is ruled out.



 तत्र केषांचित् फलं तदेव प्रमाणम्। अपरेषां तु प्रमाणादन्यत्(त्र) प्रमाणव्यक्त्यन्तरम्(रे)। यथा घटविज्ञानस्य प्रमाणस्य हानोपादानोपेक्षाबुद्धयः फलमिति। गुणदोषतदुभय(वद्भव) शून्यत्वविषयत्वादुपादानादिबुद्धीनां प्रमाणभूतघटविज्ञानादत्यन्तभेदः। ततश्चान्यविषयस्य प्रमाणस्य अन्य(प्रमेयस्य)–विषयप्रमाण(णे) व्यक्त्यन्तरं(रे) फलमिति॥

 Objection—In this context some say that the instrument of valid knowledge is also the

result.[^334]

There are others who say that the result is different from the means of true knowledge and is a different form of right knowledge. Thus in the means which bring about the knowledge of a pot the result is the feeling of acceptance, rejection or being indifferent to it.

[^334]: "This is a reference to the Buddhist theory of 'pramâṇam avisaṃvâdî jñânam'."

 As the feelings of acceptance, etc., have as its objects the good (qualities), the defects and the absence of both (in the pot), it is totally different from the knowledge of the pot which is valid (true) knowledge. Therefore it follows that the result of the means of true cognition is a different thing, having valid knowledge relating to something different.



न हि खदिरच्छेदनस्य खदिरोपादानं तत्परित्यागो वा फलं भवितुं युक्तम्। वि (अपि) योगसंबन्धफलत्वात् त्यागोपादानयोः। न च फलस्य फलं सम्भवति। द्वैधीभावफलव्यवहितत्वाच्च॥

 किं च—फलस्य चेत् फलं क्रियानपेक्षाप्रसङ्गः। फलार्थं हि क्रियापेक्ष्यते तच्चेत्फलं विनापि क्रियया फलादपि सिध्यति, (अतोह्य) ततो न ह्यनेकायासापेक्षितनिष्पत्तिक्रियामनुतिष्ठेत्। साधनान्वेषणानुपपत्तिश्च। क्रियाया अभावात्॥

 Answer—It is not proper to say that the cutting of the khadira tree has either the acceptance of the khadira wood or throwing it away as its result; since both the throwing away or accepting it is the result of separation or connection and it is not correct to have a result for a

result;[^335]

in this way there will be a division of result into two.

[^335]: "Then there will be an infinite regress."

 Moreover there is this additional point—if there is a result for a result then there will arise the irrelevance of action (in producing a result); it is seen (on the other hand) that it is for the sake of a result that action is done. Therefore if that result comes about through a result without the need of an action, then many people will not resort to any action which depends on great effort to yield result. And since there will be no action (effort) there will be no need for the search for means (of action) (as seen in the

world).[^336]

 नापि क्रियैव फलं,क्रियानुपरमप्रसङ्गात्।फलावसाना हि (पि)क्रिया।क्रियायाश्च फलत्वे फलानभिलाषित्वप्रसङ्गः।तस्या दुःखत्वात्॥

[^336]: "These are the various difficulties in admitting a result from a result."

 तस्मान्न प्रमाणस्वरूपमेव फलम्,नापि तद्व्यतिरिक्तप्रमाणान्तरमित्याह—फलं तदविशिष्ट इत्यादि।तदविशिष्टः तया प्रमाणाख्यया वृत्त्या अविशिष्टः तुल्यः तदाकारत्वेन, पौरुषेयः पुरुषस्यायं बोध इति।पुरुषस्य हि वृत्त्याकारता। तस्मान्नाक्रियाजं द्रव्यस्वरूपमात्रं फलम्। किं तर्हि ? द्रव्यस्यैवावस्थान्तरविशेषः (ष) क्रियाजः(जा) क्रियापर्यवसानकालः क्रियोपरमोपपत्तेः फलम्। फलनिष्पत्तावेव हि क्रियोपरम उपपद्यते।एवंभूतस्य मुख्यफलत्वे प्रधाानक्रियाव्यवहित (विप्रकृष्टायाः) क्रियाया द्रव्यं द्रव्यस्य वा क्रिया फलमित्यन्योन्यप्रत्युपस्थापकत्वेन प्रधानफलाभिमुखीकरणात् फलत्वोपचारो न विरोत्स्यते॥



 Answer—Nor can the result be the action alone as (then) there is the difficulty of the non-stoppage of action. One understands that action culminates in the production of the result. And if the result belongs to effort there will be the danger of not desiring the result, since it can only lead to

suffering.[^337]

 Therefore the result is not valid knowledge itself nor is it another knowledge different from it. Thus he says "phalam tadaviśiṣṭa and so on. "tadaviśiṣṭaḥ pauruṣeyaḥ" = this knowledge of puruṣa is the same as the modification of the mind known as true knowledge since it assumes the same form. Puruṣa has the same form as the modification. Therefore the result is not just the nature of a substance, produced through non-action. Then what is it? It is the state of a substance in another form, it is produced by action, it comes into effect along with the duration of the effort and its result is produced at the cessation of the effort. The cessation of effort is proper only on the attainment of the result. Thus the main result is of this nature; the main effort can have other efforts in between having material results and alternatively the material can have action (effort) as result; thus by mutually supporting each other, its being described figuratively as result is not contradicted, as its purpose is to achieve the main result (of knowledge as belonging to puruṣa).

[^337]: "The pûrvapakṣin takes up another argument. Since the result produces another result and an effort is supposed to culminate in the result, there will be the danger of continuous effort without any respite. And then, since no one wants to work continuously they will stop desiring any result."

 

ननु च भवतोऽप्युपचरितमेव फलम् वृत्त्यविशिष्टतायाः फलत्वेनाभ्युपगमात्, पुरुषस्य च शुद्धत्वात्, तदाकारताया अनृतत्वम्। न हि स्फटिकमणेरलक्तकोपधानाकारता सत्या॥

 बाढम्—तथापि त्वेतदेव फलं मुख्यम्,दृष्टत्वात्।मुख्यफलान्तरादर्शनात्। सर्वस्यैव क्रियाकारकजातस्यैतत्फलार्थत्वात्। एतदवसानं हि तत्सर्वम्। तथा च प्रदर्शितम्॥

 Objection—But then, your result is also a figurative one since you call the result as not different from the modification (of the mind); since puruṣa is pure his assuming the form (of the modification) is false. The taking on of the red colour due to proximity (of something red) by the crystal is not something true.

 Answer—You are quite right. Even then this is the main result as seen in the world. One does not see any other important result than this (main) one. This is the result aimed at by the collection of actions and the agent (of the actions)—they all have this result in view and that is how it is seen (in the world).

 

ननु च मिथ्याभूतस्यैव मुख्यफलत्वं वृत्त्याकारस्य, तथा च तदभिलाषानुपपत्तिः। बाढम्— मिथ्याभूत एव वृत्त्यनुगतो भोगः। तथा चाह—सत्त्वपुरुषयोरत्यन्तासंकीर्णयोः प्रत्ययाविशेषो भोगः इति॥ भाष्यमपि—तयोः स्वरूपोपलम्भे सति कुतो भोग इति॥ अत एव च सम्यग्दर्शनादात्यन्तिकी निवृत्तिरुपपद्यते॥

 Objection—But then, if the main result of the form of the modification (of the mind) is false there will be the undesirable consequence of explaining the desire for it.

 Answer—You are quite right. The experience which accompanies the modification (as knowledge) is indeed false. Thus it is said-Experience (of pleasure and pain) is a feeling of identity between the sattva-intellect and the puruṣa which are quite distinct from each

other.[^338]

The commentary also (says) "when there is knowl-

[^338]: "Cf. YS, III.35."

experience."[^339]

Therefore it is said that due to right insight (discriminate-discerninent ) there is absolute cessation (of the modificat

ions).[^340]

 

[^340]: "Thus this supports the theory of falsehood."

येषाममिथ्या फलं,तेषां वैराग्यकारणाभावात् सम्यग्दर्शनान्वेषणानुपपत्तेर्मोक्षाभावः।न च क्रियापरिनिष्पाद्यो मोक्षः, अनित्यत्वप्रसङ्गात्॥

 Those who consider the results as real, will not have a reason to practise detachment (and) since there will be no reason to search deeply for right insight there will be no liberation (in their case). Moreover liberation will not be something brought about by action for then it will be impermanent.

 

अथ बुद्धिबोद्धृत्वं पुरुषस्य सत्त्वं चासिद्धमिति चेत् आह—प्रतिसंवेदी बुद्धेः पुरूष इत्युपरिष्टात् प्रवेदयिष्याम इति॥

 Objection—It is said then that the knowledge of the modification (of the mind) by puruṣa as also its existence is not established.

 Answer ( is given by Vyâsa as) “puruṣa is conscious by reflection—thus we will explain

later."[^341]

 Those who accept direct perception due to the contact of the object with the sense-

[^341]: "VBh., under I.6. The reading in available texts is  "

organs[^342]

even they do not know correctly, as any contact will be the result of an action; and contact is a contact between two things and they (Naiyâyikas) desire that as produced by an

[^342]: "Reference is to the Naiyâyikas who believe in this."

action.[^343]

That which arises from something else is the proof (valid means) of that. And that which arises is its fruit (result).[^344]

[^343]: "According to the Nyâya school."

 फलमपि सन्निकर्षो ज्ञानं प्रति प्रमाणमिति चेत्—तच्च न—ज्ञापकप्रमाणप्रस्तावे कारकप्रमाणोपन्यासस्यायुक्तत्वात्। सन्निकर्षो हि ज्ञानस्योत्पादको न तस्य ज्ञापकः। प्रमेयाधिगमाय हि प्रत्यक्षादीन्युपन्यस्तानि, न ज्ञानोत्पत्तिकारणम्। तत्प्रक्रियायाम (यान्य) प्रकृतं प्रक्रियेत॥

[^344]: "Thus samyoga is the result of action."

 Objection—It is said that contact which is the result should be considered as the proof (means) with regard to knowledge.

 Answer—It is not so. In the discussion of means which makes a thing known it is not correct to bring in that which creates a thing as a proof (means). Contact is the one which gives rise to knowledge and not one which makes it known. (Proofs like) direct perception and others have been mentioned in order to reveal the known (object) and they are not the ones creating knowledge. In case that is done it will be introducing something not relevant to the topic under discussion.

 Objection—This is also possible—knowledge is also something that is known and that is known while it arises; therefore it can be said that contact which is the cause for its rise is itself what makes it known.

 Answer—But that is not so; knowledge is known only through knowledge which is what is admitted by

them.[^345]

And contact is not knowledge as it has been accepted as the one which gives rise to knowledge.

[^345]: "The Naiyâyika who admits 'anuvyavasâya' which is another knowledge."

** **अथ ज्ञानस्य ज्ञाने सत्रिकर्षो निमित्तत्वात् प्रमाणमिति चेददृष्टेश्वरेच्छाविषयनिमेषोन्मेषादीनामपि निमित्तत्वात् प्रमाणत्वे कः प्रद्वेषः ? न च ज्ञानस्य ज्ञेयत्वे आत्मनश्च स्वभावचिद्रूपत्वानभ्युपगमे शक्या अनवस्था परिहर्तुम्॥

 Objection—But then, it is said that in the knowledge of knowledge, contact being a cause, it can be considered to be valid knowledge.

 Answer—One can then ask what is wrong in accepting dharma,

adharma,[^346]

the object of Îśvara’s desire, the closing and opening (i.e., winking) of the eye and so on, as valid knowledge, since they also are there (invariably) and therefore can be considered as cause (of knowledge). And in knowledge being known one cannot avoid infinite regress without admitting the inherent character of consciousness of the âtman.

[^346]: "adṛṣṭa stands for dharma and adharma."

 

अथ आत्मसमवेतमात्रतयैव ज्ञानस्य ज्ञेयता, न ज्ञानान्तरमपेक्ष्यते येनातिप्रसज्येतेति चेत्—अस्याप्यन्यत् प्रत्यक्षलक्षणं वाच्यम् अनिन्द्रियसन्निकर्षादिलक्षणत्वादात्मनि ज्ञानसमवायत्वस्य। सन्निकर्षस्य च ज्ञानोत्पत्तिफलत्वात्तदुत्पत्तिव्यवधाने सति तस्य ज्ञानेन नानन्तर्यम्।

 

तस्मात्तदानन्तर्येणापि न सन्निकर्षफलत्वं ज्ञानस्य। तथा हानादिबुद्धीनामपि रूपादिज्ञानफलत्वानुपपत्तिरुक्ता॥

 Objection—Now it is said that knowledge is (has the property of being) known only by inherence in âtman and it is not in need of another knowledge which (if accepted) will lead to infinite regress.

 Answer—This will also need another direct perception since the inherence of knowledge in âtman has the quality of being in contact without the aid of the

senses.[^347]

And since contact has the result of giving rise to knowledge (according to Nyâya) when there is a delay there will be no continuity with that knowledge.

[^347]: "So to know about the inherence there would have to be another pratyakṣa."

 Therefore knowledge cannot be the result of a contact because of the problem of continuity. Similarly the ideas of rejection, etc., do not fit into the result of knowledge of colour (form) and so on.

 

व्यभिचाराच्च।यथैकस्मिन्नङ्गनादिपिण्डविषये ज्ञाने समाने बहूनामुत्पन्ने कस्यचिदुपादानबुद्धिः,अन्यस्य हेयबुद्धिः कस्यचिदुभयाभावः,तत्र हानोपादानबुद्धिर्व्यभिचरति।अन्यतरत्रैकमेव ज्ञानं तदेवोभयं व्यभिचरत्युपेक्षकस्य। यच्च यद्व्यभिचरति न तत्तस्य फलम्॥

 Moreover there are many counter-examples.For instance with reference to the body of a woman, though the knowledge that arises is common to many, in one of



them there is the feeling of possessing her, in another there is the feeling of rejecting her, and in another there is the feeling of indifference (absence of both feelings) towards her. In that context, the theory of acceptance or rejection is not on sure ground. On the other hand, knowledge is the same but in the case of one who is indifferent, both (acceptance and rejection) are not seen. That which violates the rule in relation to another cannot be its result.

 

किं च—हानोपादानाभावमात्रत्वादभाव एवोपेक्षा। न चाभावः प्रमाणस्य वस्तुनः फलं भवितुमर्हति।रागद्वेषाभ्यां चोपादानपरित्यागबुद्धी। तदभावात् कारणाभावे कार्याभाव इति प्रमाणविज्ञाने सत्यपि हानोपादानबुद्ध्यभाव एवोपेक्षेति व्यभिचारान्न हानादिबुद्धिफलत्वम्॥

 

किं च—रागद्वेषतदभावानामप्युपादानादिबुद्धिफलत्वे प्रमाणत्वप्रसङ्गः। पौरुषेयचित्तवृत्तिबोधफलत्वे तु न किञ्चिद्विरुध्यत इति॥

 Indifference is just 'absence' as it is only the absence of acceptance and rejection. And absence cannot be the result of valid knowledge. The feelings of acceptance and rejection are due to (spring from) attachment and hatred. In their absence. (absence of attachment and hatred) due to the rule that there is absence of effect in the absence of cause, there will be the absence of the feelings of acceptance and rejection, even though there is knowledge of valid cognition; and that is indifference. Thus, because of this contradiction, the feclings (thoughts ) of rejection and so on, cannot be the result of valid knowledge.

 Moreover the mind's ideas of acceptance and so on, are also the result of attachment, hatred and indifference to both (absence of both); in that case the very definition of valid knowledge is vitiated (contradicted) (as attachment,etc.,would become valid knowledge); whereas when the result is knowledge of the modification of the mind as belonging to puruṣa there is no contradiction.

 

ननु च चित्तवृत्तेः संवेद्यत्वमसिद्धम्। न हि करणमेव कर्म भवति। न हि दात्रमेव लूयते। नैष दोषः। क्रियाकारकयोर्भिन्नधर्मत्वात्। क्रियानिर्वृत्तिं प्रति सम्भूय कारकाणि व्याप्रियन्ते परस्परं विषयविषयिभावेन।क्रिया तु सत्तामात्रेणैव फलहेतुरिति करणत्वमस्यामुपचर्यते, न कारकवत्। कुर्वद्धि कारयेदिति क्रियाधिकारकं स्यान्न भूतं भव्यायोपदिश्येत॥

 Objection—But then, in this way, the knowability of the modification of the mind has not been proved. It is not possible for an instrument to become the object

also.[^348]


[^348]: "cittavṛtti being the instrument how can it also be the object of knowledge?"


For instance, the knife is not the object which is cut by it (the knife).

 Answer—There is no defect in this (argument) as the action and the agents of the action are different. The various agents (of action) collectively function towards the completion of the action having a mutual relationship of object and that possessing the object (subject).(In this context) the action by its very being, is the cause for the result and its instrumentality is only figurative, and it is not like being an agent of the action. Thus by saying that the one while acting (doing) is also the one which causes the result, one understands that there is the authority to act (to be the instrument); and the past cannot be said to describe the

future.[^349]


[^349]: "The instrument being in the past and the result being in the future."


 

किं च—अनवस्थाप्रसङ्गश्च। क्रिया चेत् करणं स्यात्,तन्निर्वर्त्यया चान्यया क्रियया भवितव्यम्।न ह्यन्यां क्रियामन्तरेण तस्याः कारणत्वं घटते। यापि चान्या सापि कारणं स्यादन्यस्याः क्रियायाः।साप्यन्यस्या इत्यनवस्था।ततश्च क्रियासन्तानानुपरमात् फलानभिनिर्वृत्तिः। तत्रान्त्या चेत् क्रियान्तरेण विना फलहेतुर्भवेत्, प्रथमस्य तथात्वे कः प्रद्वेषः?

 Moreover, there will be the undesirable consequence of infinite regress. If action is also the instrument of action then in order to accomplish its task there should be another action. Without another action (to make it act) it cannot be called the instrument of action. And that another will also be an instrument (cause) of another action and that also will be of another ( action); in this way, there will be infinite regress. And then since there will be no cessation of the series of actions there will be no result accomplished. And if it is said that a final action will cause the result without the need of another action, then one can ask what is wrong in assuming that of the first action itself.

 

चित्तवृत्तेस्त्वभिव्यञ्जकत्वात् संवेद्यतेत्यदोषः॥

 दृश्यते चाभिव्यञ्जकानां स्वरूपसंवेद्यतयैव करणत्वं प्रदीपादीनाम्। तथा चित्तवृत्तेरपि।

 There is no harm in saying that the mental modification can be known as it has the capacity to reveal. (In the world) it is seen that such things like lamps etc., which have the power of revealing objects through being themselves knowable, also have the power of instrumen

tality.[^350]

Similar is the case with the mental modification.

[^350]: "The light reveals other objects as well as itself. Thus it is an instrument and an object when viewed differently."

 Objection—It is said that though the eye, etc., have the power to reveal objects it does not always reveal; therefore the rule is not always applicable.

 Answer—There is a confusion of similar things ( here).

 Objection—How do you say that?

 Answer—In the case of those senses which are physical ( gross ) the eye, having the quality of light which arises along with the light outside which is similar, there is ignorance about perceiving itself. As for instance when there are many lamps whose lights all arise simultaneously, it is not possible to distinguish which light belongs to which lamp. And it is similar in the case of sense-of-hearing and so on.

 Objection—But then, even in the case of the senses which are not physical (

gross)[^351] which is subtle.")

[^351]: "The reference is to the mind (subtle-senses



(one can say) they are similar to the mental modification because of the power to reveal objects; and due to the quality of revealing objects it (mental modification) can also not be

perceived.[^352] are not perceived in spite of having the capacity to reveal. So the mental modification also need not be perceived by the same argument.")

[^352]: "The subtle-senses (the mind

 Answer—That is not so; due to its being coloured by the consciousness it is not distinguishable and not distanced from it. Though omnipresent, the âtman being subtle and being extremely pure and also being inseparable from the mind, grasps the modification of the mind; thus, by the mental modification which is the means of true knowledge, purusa also,by taking on its (modification) form,has knowledge as belonging to it. Thus it is established that the result is that which is being known as belonging to it (puruṣa ).



येषां पुनः प्रत्यक्षेणासंवेद्या चित्तवृत्तिस्तेषां फल्ग्रहणप्रमाणाभावः। फले च गृहीते ज्ञानासिद्धत्वस्यार्थापत्तिः। न च फलं गृह्यते प्रमाणव्यापारानभ्युपगमात्।तदभ्युपगमे चानवस्थाप्रसङ्गः।यत्फलावग्रहणाय प्रमाणमभ्युपगम्यते तस्याप्यन्यत् फलं तत्प्रमाणस्याप्यन्यदिति न क्वचिदवतिष्ठेत॥

 अथ न प्रमाणव्यापारस्तस्य तदा प्रमाणाभावात् फलस्यासत्त्वं प्रसक्तम् यत्र हि सदुपलम्भकानि प्रमाणानि न व्यापारं गच्छन्ति, तत्रास्तीत्यभ्युपगच्छामः (तेषाम्)।

 There are those who believe that the mental modification is not known through direct perception and (also) that there is absence of the means to grasp the result. And if (knowledge as) result is admitted then (they say that ) there will be the implication of knowledge not being established as there is no result perceived without admitting the operation of the means of true knowledge. And if it (means) is admitted there will be the problem of infinite regress. That means of true knowledge which is admitted in order to grasp true knowledge will have a result and that will need another means of right knowledge as proof; thus there will be no end to this.

 According to them then, there is no operation of the means of right knowledge; then because there is no means of knowledge the result (of true knowledge) does not exist. Wherever the means of proof which causes perception of an existing thing do not function one has to conclude that the thing does not exist.

 

अथ अगृह्यमाणमपि तदेव ज्ञानं प्रमाणं फलस्यापीति चेत्—न—अभिव्यञ्जकधर्मव्यतिक्रमात्। न ह्यभिव्यञ्जकं गृह्यमाणमभिव्यञ्जयदृष्टम्। न ह्युल्का गिरिशिखरेऽपि निजं धर्ममतिक्रामति॥

 Objection—Then it is said that even though it is not accepted, that sarne knowledge can be the means for proving the result (of knowledge) as well.

 Answer—That is not so—since it will overstep the rule of revelation. That which is considered as the revealer is not seen to be itself the revealed. Even at the top of a hill a flame (of fire ) does not transgress its innate

nature.[^353]


[^353]: "He is going through the same arguments based on the revealer and the revealed dichotomy. The flame in this case reveals the mountain but not itself."


अथाभिव्यञ्जयदेव फलं प्रत्यपि प्रमाणमिति चेत्—सिद्धं तर्हीप्सितमस्माकम्। रागादीनां वृत्तिविशेषणत्वेन ग्रहणोपपत्तेः। रक्तोऽहं द्विष्टोऽहमिति यद्यहंप्रत्ययविशेषणं, तदापि वृत्तिभावाभावित्वेनैव ग्रहणाद्वृत्तिविशेषणानां रागादीनां ग्रहणमुपपद्यते। अ(तेना)न्यथा रूपादिवन्मानान्तरापेक्षत्वप्रसङ्गात्। ततश्चानवस्थेति॥

 तस्मात्प्रमाणफलानभिज्ञानामभिमानमात्रमेव केवलं पण्डितंमन्यानामित्युपेक्षणीयमिति॥



 Objection—Then it is said that being revealed is itself the means of knowledge with reference to the result also.

 Answer—That is exactly what we want to say. As attachment and so on, are special modifications (of the mind) they are fit to be known. 'I am attached','I hate', are qualifying the idea 'I' and it is proper to understand the special mental modifications of attachment, etc., as the individual (I) possessing or not possessing it. Otherwise there will be the need of some other means of knowledge as in the case of knowing colour, etc., which will result in a regress.

 Therefore those who refuse to recognise the result of true knowledge are only proud and are only fools who think themselves to be learned; therefore they should be ignored.

 He now mentions (what is) inference through the words "anumeyasya tulyajâtîyeṣvanuvṛtta" and so on. The "anumeyasya" = subject which is qualified by the characteristic (being investigated), due to the presence of that characteristic in things belonging to the same class ("tulyajâtîyeṣvanuvṛttaḥ), and being differentiated from those belonging to different classes by not having that (characteristic). "saṃbandhaḥ" and so on. He asks—what is the relationship and between which two things is it? It is not possible for a relation to become a relationship without reference to the two things

related,[^354]

which is well-known and is mentioned by the word

[^354]: "The style of the Vivaraṇakâra is rather gross. Even obvious things are related as if they are very difficult to follow. This is a case in point."

"yaḥ".[^355]

 

[^355]: "In the commentary of Vyâsa under 1.6."

ननु च अनुमानस्य प्रकृतत्वात्, लिङ्गलिङ्गिनोः सम्बन्धः प्रसिद्ध एव—न—अगमकत्वात्। न केवलः सम्बन्धो गमकः। उच्यते—लिङ्गस्यैव सम्बन्धो व्यावृत्त्यनुवृत्त्योः। कः पुनरसौ ? लिङ्गमेव। न हि लिङ्गादन्यदनुवृत्तं व्यावृत्तं च। तच्च गमकम्।

 Objection—But then, this nature of inference is well-known as being the relationship between the distinguishing mark and that possessing the distinguishing mark.

 Answer—That is not so, because it is not convincing. It is not the relationship alone that is proof (of inference). It is thus said that the relationship of inclusion and exclusion has to belong to the distinguishing mark (in an inference). And what is that—it is the distinguishing mark itself. Inclusion and exclusion is not of anything other than the distinguishing mark. And that is proof (of inference).

 

ननु लिङ्गमपि नैव गमकं लिङ्गिसम्बन्धानपेक्षं, यदि चानपेक्षितलिङ्गलिङ्गिसम्बन्धं गमकं, यत्किञ्चिद्गमकं स्यात्, तस्मात् लिङ्गलिङ्गिसम्बन्धो वक्तव्यः॥

 Objection—The distinguishing mark is also not proof (of inference) without reference to the relationship with that possessing the mark. If the proof does not take into consideration the relationship between the distinguishing mark and that possessing



the mark then anything can become the means of proof.Therefore the relationship between the distinguishing mark and that possessing the mark is to be mentioned.

 

न—उक्तत्वात्॥ 'अनुमेयस्य तुल्यजातीयेष्वनुवृत्तः' इत्यादिनैवोक्तत्वात्।न ह्यनुमेयेनासंबद्धं लिङ्गिना तत्सदृशजातीयेष्वनुवर्तते, भिन्नजातीयेम्यो वा निवर्तते। तस्मात् य इति च प्रसिद्धमेव संबन्धमनुवदति॥

 Answer—That is not so because it has been mentioned.By (the words) “anumeyasya tulyajâtîyeṣvanuvṛttaḥ" and so on, that has been mentioned.Without this relationship (of the mark) with the one possessing the distinguishing mark which is to be inferred, it is not possible that it will be present in things belonging to the same class,nor would it be excluded from things belonging to a different

class.[^356]

Therefore the word “yaḥ” is only reiterating the well-known relationship.

[^356]: "This is understood and need not be stated."

 

तद्विषया—एवमन्वयव्यतिरेकविशिष्टसंबन्धसंबन्धिविषया वृत्तिः।सामान्यावधारणप्रधाना—लिङ्गिसामान्यावधारणप्रधाना, अनुमानम्॥

 तस्मादित्थंजातीयकमविनाभावेन संबद्धं संबन्ध्यन्तरं गमयति। यथा वध्यघातक (कृदि) कार्यकारणादि॥

 “tadviṣayâ vṛttiḥ" = in this way, the modification which is concerned with the relationship between the mark and that possessing the mark which is qualified by concomitance and exclusion and which “sâmânyâvadhâranapradhânâ"=mainly comprehends the general characteristic (universal) is "anumânam" = inference.

 “yathâ deśântaraprâptergatimaccandratârakam caitravat". Even though it (inference) can be known by its definition given (above) still, by giving examples and counter-examples he explains it further. Thus he gives examples. In the example given, "gatimaccandratârakam”, the motion of the moon and stars is inferred. Movement from one place to another is present in things belonging to the same class having motion like in the case of the man Caitra; and it is differentiated from such things as the Vindhya mountains which have no motion—thus there is no violation of the

rule.[^357]

There is this constant relationship of movement (and reaching another place).

[^357]: "The rule of motion and getting to another place is well founded."

 Therefore the related (two) are of this nature and leads one to another related (phenomenon) without fail, as in the case of the killer and the

killed[^358]

being (in the relationship of) cause and effect.

[^358]: "This is a very unusual example given; it is not even very specific."



भवतु तावदविरुद्धानां नित्यसंबन्धाद्देशान्तरप्राप्त्यादीनां गम्यगमकता,वध्यघातकादीनां तु संबन्धाभावे कथमित्युच्यते गम्यगमकभावः (भावेन) ?

 तत्रापि नित्यसंबन्धाददोषः। न ह्यन्यत्रापि प्राप्तिलक्षणः संबन्धोऽभिप्रेयते। सामान्यतो दृष्टा (नु) भावप्रसङ्गात्। न हि चन्द्रतारकादिषु देशान्तरप्राप्तेः प्राप्तिलक्षणसंबन्धः प्रत्यक्षेण गृह्यते।

 Objection—But then, we can grant that in examples like reaching another place



there is an eternal relationship between things which are not opposed to each other; so it is convincing to infer that; but in the case of examples like the hunter and the hunted there is no such relationship; then how can you say that it is convincing to infer that?

 Answer—Even in such instances there is no harm done as there is an eternal relationship. Even in other places the relationship characterised by reaching another place (and motion in the moon and star) is not intended, as generally one does not observe it.For instance,one does not directly perceive the relationship between motion and reaching another place of the moon, stars and so on.

 Objection—But then, if the proof is not experienced then everything can become the proof of everything else. It is not as if things are not related to each other as for instance, space and so on, are present

everywhere.[^359]

 Answer—Therefore only that relationship which is the cause of giving rise to the idea of a conviction from which something is inferred can be relevant to inference. Thus in the case of the hunter and the hunted also, when one sees (only) one of them one infers the absence of the other; thus it is a case of inference alone. When one sees the absence of something in its usual place one infers its presence in another place. Thus by seeing the hunter one infers the absence of the

[^359]: "Therefore all things are related through space, wind and so on according to the pûrvapakṣin."

hunted.[^360]

When one does not see the living Caitra in his house, one concludes that he is

[^360]: "This relationship is not invariable like motion and reaching another place. A hunter, if not in the mood, may not kill even if the hunted is in the same place. One knows of instances, in nature, where even the lion's prey can sense when the lion is not hungry and moves about fearlessly in its vicinity."

outside.[^361]


[^361]: "This is arthâpatti and not inference."


ननु चाभावार्थापत्ती एते, नानुमाने, (न) लक्षणासङ्गतेः, गवादिवत्॥

 न—यथोक्तलक्षणोपपत्तेः—वध्यघातकयोर्विरोधलक्षणःसंबन्धः। यत्र यत्र घातकभावस्तत्र तत्र वध्याभाव एवेत्यविनाभावः। न हि वध्यस्याभावं घातक (का) भावो व्यभिचरति। वध्यस्य वा भावो घातका (क) भावम् अग्निभावमिव धूमभावः॥

 Objection—But then, these instances are cases of cognition of absence and arthâpatti (implication) and not inference, as the definition (given) does not fit (in these cases) as in the case of (horns) in the example of the cow.

 Answer—That is not so; the said definition fits in (here too).The relationship between the hunter and the hunted is that of opposition (to each other).There is an invariable concomitance given in the statement 'wherever there is the hunter there is the absence of the hunted'. The presence of the hunter invariably means the absence of the hunted and the presence of the hunted means the absence of the hunter. It is like the presence of fire in the presence of smoke.

 Objection—But then how is the (specific) knowledge of the absence of the hunted. inferred from just the presence of the hunter which is seen. It is not necessary that the proofs which reveal the presence of the hunter are not operative with reference to the hunted.

 Answer—He replies that the same proof which is employed in knowing the presence of the hunter gives rise to the knowledge of the absence of the

hunted;[^362] could have used such an argument.")

[^362]: "It is difficult to believe that the Vivaraṇakâra (if he is Śaṅkara

it is like the proof which is employed in knowing smoke which gives rise to the knowledge of fire; similarly the proof employed with regard to the special knowledge of a hunter gives rise to the knowledge of the absence of the special knowledge of the

hunted;[^363]

it is like the knowledge of the special knowledge of fire which arises from the same proof employed in the knowledge of the special knowledge of smoke.

[^363]: "Each hunter and hunted being related to each other as rivals. But the argument is not sound. Will the presence of the lion mean the absence of all the animals which are its prey or only some specific animal. Thus there can be many defects in this line of thinking. Can this kind of reasoning be attributed to a thinker like Śaṅkara who is well-known for his precision in thought."

 In the case of those who believe in absence as true knowle

ished;[^365]

therefore, following the sight of a special enemy (like the hunter) does not give rise to the sight of the absence of its opposite enemy (the hunted). (In inference on the other hand) there is the accompaniment of the specific mark in the understanding of the specific inferred object. There is nothing specific about absence as the operation of the proof which reveals an existent thing through which there is known a specific knowledge, having that specific idea.

[^365]: "How can one distinguish the 'absence' of a book from the 'absence' of a pen o. a pencil. There is no distinguishing mark of one absence which separates it from the other absences."

[^368]: "Only that which is accepted by both sides as an example, without any doubt, can be allowed. That is not the case here in the case of the existence of absence."

 Answer——That is not so;for in the case of a pot, etc.,they have been seen as associated with existence.

 

न चापि निर्व्यापारस्यावस्तुत्वादभावस्य प्रमाणभावो युक्तः।न हि निरस्तव्यापारकं किंचित् कार्यारम्भकं दृश्यते लोके। तस्माद्व्यापाररूपप्रमाणजनिता प्रमेयाभावबुद्धिः,प्रमेयविषयत्वात् घटादिबुद्धिवत्।तथा च वस्तुत्वात् प्रवृत्तिनिवृत्तिहेतुत्वात्।विपक्षः शशविशाणादिः। तथा अभाव\[प्रमा\]प्रमाणा(ण) भावजनिता न भवति, यथाऽभिहितहेतुदृष्टान्तदर्शनात्। (नेन)॥

 It is not proper to consider absence as a proof as it is not an object since it has no function. We do not see anything which is without any action producing any effect in the world. Therefore the idea of absence of something which is brought about by knowledge in the form of an action, is like the idea of knowing a pot because it has the object of something knowable. And because it is an object it is the cause for both action and cessation of action. Its counter-examples are rabbit's horns and so on. Thus the knowledge of absence is not created by valid proof (knowledge) of absence as it is seen that a thing is like what is said to be its cause.

 

घातकदर्शनं वध्याभावबुद्धेर्लिङ्गं तद्भावभावित्वादग्न्यादिबुद्धिनिमित्तधूमादिबुद्धिवत् संशयनिवर्तकत्वाच्च। वध्याभावबुद्धिर्वा लिङ्गजनिता निश्चयरूपत्वादग्निबुद्धिवदिति॥

 The sight of the hunter is an indicatory mark of the absence of the hunted as it is created by the presence of it (the hunter); it is like the idea of smoke and so on, which are causes for producing the idea of (the presence of) fire, etc., and it removes doubt (in the mind). Or the idea of the absence of the hunted which is created by the indicatory mark (of the presence of the hunter) creates a certainty like the idea of fire (from the mark of smoke).

 Objection—The statement here that 'The pot is not here' is not an inference as there is no knowledge of the relationship between a mark and that possessing the mark. Nor is there a search for any indicatory mark here in the absence of the pot, as in the case of the search for the mark of smoke in the idea of (presence of) fire. This is because there is already the idea (of absence) before the search for an indicatory mark.



 Answer—There is no defect in this. The idea in the form 'here' is itself an indicatory mark. It is not necessary that a search for the indicatory mark is only when there is already an idea of the indicatory mark. The idea coloured by the form 'here' is the indicatory mark for the idea of the absence of the pot which is not coloured by that; as in the idea of the absence of the hunter here also,there is the characteristic of opposition (exclusion).[^369]

 यत्र पुनरविरुद्धान्युपरञ्जकानि तत्रास्तित्वबुद्धेः।एतेनैवार्थापत्तेरनुमानत्वं व्याख्यातमविनाभावेन संबन्धेन।तत्रापि जीवतो हि देवदत्तस्य गृहाभावे बहिर्भावः,यदा गृहे भावः न तदा बहिर्भाव इत्यन्यतरेणानुमानम्।साक्षात् दृश्यमानबहिर्भावाभ्यन्तराभावत्वं दृष्टान्तः। वृत्त्युपरञ्जकानुपरञ्जकत्वेन ह्यभावग्रहणस्याभिहितो हेतुः॥

[^369]: "Between 'here' and absence."

 Wherever there is no opposition between the things that influence ideas, there is the thought of presence of it. By this example 'presumption being (another form of) inference has been explained, as there is an invariable relationship (between two things).[^370] Even in the other example,[^371] when the living Devadatta is not found in the house, his presence outside is a case of inference both ways, as when he is in the house he is not present outside.[^372]

[^370]: "The Nyâya–Vaiśeṣika and Sâṅkhya-Yoga do not accept arthâpatti as a separate means of knowledge but include it under inference."

[^371]: "Devadatta, not being found in the house, his presence outside the house is understood through inference."

In this case it is the direct perception of his presence outside that makes clear his absence inside (the house). The cause for the understanding of absence is the idea of something not being grasped through a modification,which is supposed to grasp it.

[^372]: "Inference can be applied in both ways here."

 अग्न्यादावपि दहनादिशक्तिग्रहणमनुमानमेव। कार्यनिर्वर्तकयोरविनाभावसंबन्धस्यात्मनि दृष्टत्वाद्भुज्यादौ। दृश्यते हि प्रत्यगात्मनि शक्तोऽहमिदं कार्यं कर्तुमशक्तोऽहमित्यात्मवदात्मविशेषणस्य शक्तेर्ग्रहणम्। शक्तिनिर्वर्त्यमेव दहनादिकार्यमपीत्यनुमानसिद्धिः॥

 In the case of fire and so on, the understanding of its power of burning, etc., is also an instance of inference. One has seen the invariable relationship between the effect and that which accomplishes the effect as in the self, with regard to food, etc. As in the case of the âtman, with reference to the self, there is the knowledge of power in that which has the qualification of âtman, when one makes statements such as 'I am capable of doing this deed', 'I am incapable (of doing this ) ' ;[^373]

so also the act of burning, etc., is the fulfilment (accomplishment) of one's power, and that is an inference.[^374]

[^373]: "The embodied self is referred to here."

 ननु चाभावस्य प्रत्यक्षतामुपगायन्ति केचित्। यथा किलादर्शकेन प्रदीपादिना सति गृह्यमाणे वस्तुनि न तदवयविनि यदुपलभ्यते तन्नास्तीत्येवं सतः प्रकाशकं प्रमाणमसदपि प्रकाशयति। तथा चोदाहरन्ति—अनङ्कितं वास आनयेत्युक्तः प्रविश्य भाण्डागारम् अङ्कितानङ्कितवासस्सन्निधावङ्कितवासोग्रहणेनैव प्रत्यक्षेणाङ्काभावविशिष्टं वास उपलभ्यानयति। तस्मात् प्रत्यक्ष एवाभावो लक्षणान्तरानुपपत्तेरिति॥

[^374]: "One infers its power from the act."

 Objection—But then, some also proclaim that absence is directly perceived. Just



as when a lighted mirror reflects an object it is not as if whatever is there in the object is not there (in the image); but, in this way, the means of knowledge which reveals existence also reveals that which is not existent.[^375]

 There is also the following example given. When given the order 'Bring a cloth which is not patterned'—(a person) enters the storehouse and in the presence of patterned and non-patterned cloth (side by side) he grasps the meaning of the patterned cloth and then he knows by direct perception the non-patterned cloth, so he takes it and brings it. Therefore absence is an object of direct perception as (in this instance) there is no other characteristic (through which he could recognise the unpatterned cloth).

[^375]: "This is an unusual example. What he probably intends to say is that the mirror reveals even the back which is normally not seen. But even then it is not revelation in the way a proof of knowledge functions."

Answer—That is not so; then there will be the undesirable consequence of ascribing falsity to knowing objects through the mind taking on the form (of the objects); when the mind takes on the form (of the object) then it is known as directly perceived. Even in the case when a blue object is seen as yellow it is the idea of relationship between the qualifier and the qualified which isfalse;[^376] similarly in this case (when one knows that) 'there is no pot here' there is the idea of relationship between the place (denoted by) 'here' and 'absence of pot' though there is no relationship between them.[^377] It is not possible to understand this relationship which is not obtained between 'absence of pot' and the location 'here' as one of conjunction or inherence either, as is done when it is said 'Devadatta is here'. (Here there is a relation). There-fore like the knowledge of absence, the form 'the blue substance is yellow' which is an idea of relationship between the qualifier and qualified will be false because it is an idea of (false) relationship.

[^376]: "It is not the perception as such which is false but the understanding of the property of yellow as belonging to the blue object which is false."

[^377]: "Like saṃyoga which is obtained by two objects coming into contact with each other."

 यथा चासत्यपीहदेशघटाभावसंबन्धे संबन्धप्रतीतिस्तथैवानीलेऽपि वस्तुन्यसत्येव नीलत्वसंबन्धे नीलत्वसंबन्धप्रत्ययः प्राप्नोति, तथा संबन्धिष्वपि। अथास्त्येव संबन्धः, द्विष्ठता विरुध्येत संबन्धस्य। अभावस्यात्रस्तुत्वाभ्युपगमात्॥

 If it is said that even though there is no relationship between 'absence of pot' and the location 'here' still there is a perception of the relationship, then even in an object which is not blue when there is no relationship with blueness there will be the idea of relationship with blueness and also between the two things. A relationship is something which exists; this ambiguity (conveying two senses) is contradictory to (the idea of) relation, as one understands absence not to be an actual thing.

 Objection—There are a hundred and one meanings of the genitive case (according to the grammarian)[^378] the genitive conveying relationship can have many meanings.")and the genitive case expresses relationship.

[^378]: "Thus in the sentence ghaṭasya abhâvaḥ' (absence of pot, pot's absence

 Answer—Then( your theory)that relationship is only of two kinds called inherence and conjunction will not be correct[^379].

[^379]: "Nyâya-Vaiśeṣika believes in only these two kinds of relation."

 Objection—It can be said that all the hundred and one meanings of the genitive case can come under the two (conjunction and inherence).

 Answer—That is not possible as in the case of absence it cannot come under either.

 Furthermore, when one says 'there is no flower in the sky, here' there is no direct perception of the sky which is the related; it follows that there is no perception of the absence of the sky-flower also. If it means that there is no direct perception (here) then like (in the case of) the absence of the sky-flower in space, there is no direct perception of the absence of pot 'here' on earth. Its distinguishing mark has to be clarified.[^380]

[^380]: "Its difference from the absence of sky-flower, has to be spelt out."

 Objection—But then, it is because the sky (space) is not directly perceived.

 Answer—That is not so; when a flower is falling down one sees the presence of the sky (space); therefore the imperceptibility of the sky cannot be the reason. In the existence of a flower that is falling the invisibility of space is not a cause,[^381]similarly in the knowledge of absence (that which opposes existence) also, it cannot be a cause,

[^381]: "If it is seen in one place it should be seen everywhere—though depending on the mind."

  Objection—It is insisted that it is only due to the invisibility of space.

 Answer—Then even something which is not connected, (related) which is concealed, which is invisible can also be the cause.

 Objection—The absence of the sky-flower is directly visible.

 Answer—Then there will be the undesirable consequence of the contact of the objects and the sense-organs being meaningless everywhere. And then if that is so, since everyone will obtain knowledge without contact of sense-organs with objects there will be the undesirable consequence of everyone being omniscient.

 Objection—Then it is said that there[^382] it is a case of inference.

[^382]: "In the case of the perception of the absence of sky-flower."

 Answer—As in the case of the absence of the sky-flower (here also ) there is no distinguishing mark in the absence of the pot 'here'; therefore it is also proved to be an inference. And thus, for those who argue for absence as a proof of right knowledge it will be wise to accept it as known through inference; this absence of the pot is similar to the inference of the absence of fire, etc., even in water (s) which are concealed and which are far away.

 "vindhyâścâprâpteragatiḥ"—this is another case i.e., Vindhya does not move because it does not reach any place. What is affirmed is that the Vindhya is without motion. The indicatory mark is 'because it does not reach any place'. ‘As in the case of Caitra' connects both, like that of the crow's eye.[^383] The connection with "gatimaccandratârakam" is due to similarity and with "vindhyaścâprâpteḥ” it is due to dissimilarity. Thus there is no defect as it has been shown to hold both in the case of concomitance and exclusion.³[^384] Or it can be said that in this case, by pointing out a dissimilar, contradictory example it is shown that there is no defect (in the argument); it is without defect because the indicatory mark is inferable as that which characterises the inferred.

[^383]: "The example connects both the agreeing and the disagreeing example. This is also called ‘kâkâkṣigolakanyâyaḥ'. It is based on the belief that the crow has only one eye but it can move it from one socket on one side to the other on the opposite side."

[^384]: "'In other words the inference is without any defect. The available reading is ‘vindhyaścâprâptiḥ whereas the Vivaraṇa text has 'vindhyaścâprâpteh'."

 A reliable source (a trustworthy person) wanting to help another, conveys something which he has seen or inferred that is without any defect. "tena dṛṣṭo vâ anumito vârthaḥ paratra svabodhasaṅkrântaye[^385] = Intending to transfer one's own knowledge of a thing which has been seen or inferred. “śabdena" = a sentence from which he

[^385]: "While the reading in the bhâṣya is 'âptena dṛṣṭo'numito vârthaḥ' the Vivaraṇakâra has 'tena dṛṣṭo vâ anumito vârthaḥ'."



realises the particular meaning. "tadarthaviṣayâ" = from that sentence, used by him, the modification of the mind which has that (intended by the sentence) as its object, is like an inference which mainly comprehends the general character (universal).

 Thus, in this way, the word (scriptures ) is that which is understood by the hearer as that which belongs to a trustworthy source and it is not so for the speaker[^386].The speaker is the one who has either seen or inferred the object and that knowledge is either obtained through the senses or through an indicatory mark. For the hearer the certain knowledge is on hearing (the speaker) and is different from that brought about by the sense-organs or through an indicatory mark.

[^386]: "The word is an authority for the hearer and not for the speaker."

 स आगमः \[न\]प्रत्यक्षमिन्द्रिया\[विषय\] विषयत्वात् यथाभिहितलिङ्गलिङ्गिसंबन्धनिरपेक्षत्वाच्च नानुमानम्।न हि स्वर्गापूर्वदेवतादिशब्दा(ब्दोऽ)र्थान्वितं ज्ञानमासादितलिङ्गलिङ्गिसंबन्धपुरस्सरमुपजायते। फलं तु सर्वत्र पौरुषेयो वृत्तिबोध एव॥

 "sa âgamaḥ[^387]" = it is not direct perception as it is not the object of direct perception and since there is the absence of dependence on the relationship between an indicatory mark and that possessing the indicatory mark which is needed in an inference, it is also not an inference. The knowledge which comes about through the meaning of words like 'heaven' ( svarga), 'apûrva' ( sacrificial benefit), 'gods' (devatâ), etc., is not obtained through the relationship of the indicatory mark and that possessing the indicatory mark. The result is everywhere the knowledge of the modification as belonging to puruṣa.

[^387]: "The Vivaraṇakâra again quotes the bhâṣya differently. Instead of 'âgamaḥ' he has 'sa âgamaḥ'."

 यस्य आगमस्य वक्ता आगमाख्यवृत्त्युत्पत्तिनिमित्ते शब्दोच्चारणात् आगमस्य प्रयोगोपन्यासेन प्रतिपादितं फलं तु पूर्ववदेव। यदाप्येक एव प्रयोगस्त(था)दापि साध्यसाधनाभावमात्रस्य विवक्षितत्वान्त्र विपरीतव्यतिरेकदर्शनादित्युच्यते॥

 That speaker of the word who utters words in order to create the modification known as 'word', by reference to the word, gives rise to the result as indicated earlier.[^388] Even though there is the same usage, still there is the absence of the relationship of the means to the end desired, as one does not see the exclusion of that which is different (in this case).[^389] in the case of the speaker.")

[^388]: "He is addressing himself to those who are unreliable and not trustworthy."

[^389]: "The result can be to create confusion in the mind of the hearer as it does not have authority of proof (like pratyakṣa or anumâna

 By the use of the expression 'one whose word is not trustworthy' the word itself is qualified. How is this person, a speaker not trustworthy ? He says (in answer to that) “na dṛṣṭo’ numito vârthaḥ” i.e., that object has neither been seen nor inferred by (that)



 speaker. For instance,the Buddha or the Arhat by informing things other than what is well-known to trustworthy (learned) people (sista) (come under that category).(Wise) men whose minds are unaffected by such defects as attachment, etc., will not describe anything well-known other than it is.If they do so then their words “sa āgamaḥ plavate" = (will be) are false (though appearing to be similar to truth).

 Even though they have not mentioned (specifically) the false knowledge of something seen or inferred in their own words,**¹**still by indicating the falsehood of the word (scriptures), even in the earlier cases of perception and inference falsity is possible when it is different from its determined nature-in other words this is what is implied (by them).

  मूलवक्तरि तु आद्यवक्तरीश्वरे तन्निमित्तो य आगमः स विप्लवनिमित्ताभावान्निर्विप्लवः स्यात्।यथार्थ (य) वक्तृवत् ॥

 In the case of Isvara the first speaker, on the other hand, the scriptures which have him as the cause, are without any contradiction, as there is no cause for any contradiction; it is like speaking the truth.

 Analogy is preceded by words; since it falls under the (authority of) the 'word' it is not a separate proof (of knowledge). Thus 'the gavaya is like a cow'—it is by this utterance of the forest man alone that the resemblance of a gavaya to a cow is known; thus when a gavaya is seen in the forest its resemblance (to a cow) is decided only by the memory of the resemblance which has been created by the words heard earlier; there is nothing more than that. Resemblance is learnt earlier from the words (of the forest man).**²**

** **नापि संज्ञासंज्ञिसंबन्धप्रतिपत्तित एव मानं, तस्या अपि तद्वाक्यादेवावगतत्वात्।न हि गौरित्येतावतानवगतगवयनामकस्य वनगतगवयदर्शिनोऽपि गवयोऽयमिति संज्ञासंज्ञिसंबन्धावबोधो भवति ॥

 तस्माद्दौरिव गवय इति गवयशब्दोऽपि तद्वाक्येऽपेक्षितव्यः। तथा च सति पूर्वश्रुतादेव वाक्यात् सर्वं प्रतीतम्।

 It cannot be called a knowledge obtained from the relationship of the name and the named, since that also is learnt from the same sentence ( about it). If one only knows the gavaya as a cow and goes to the forest and sees a gavaya he will not have the knowledge of the relation between the name and the named as 'this is a gavaya'.**³**

** **Therefore the word gavaya must be included in that sentence as 'the gavaya is like a cow'. Then with the help of this sentence heard before, everything is known.

¹.He has not said specifically that he has seen or inferred it himself.  
^(2.)Thus the Vivaraṇakāra calls it a case of sabdapramāṇa and nothing more.  
³.If the relation of the name and the named were the cause then this should take place. But it does not.



 Objection—Even then, he has not had any previous knowledge of it as 'this may be a gavaya'.

 Answer—Your case seems to be like that of a tortured noble man following the left hand sākta cult trapped in a corner unable to understand how to get rid of the argument.**¹**

  Then, (in case we accept your argument), we will have to admit many kinds of resemblances divided on the basis of distance, time, being near, being far away and so on.

 Objection—Let it be so.

 Answer—It has already been mentioned that by the earlier thought something unknown or something (unknown) along with all its characteristics is to be understood. When the word cow is mentioned it is not as if the meaning of the word cow is unknown in the absence of the specifications of time, place and so on.

 Moreover there is this additional point. The knowledge of the relationship between the name and the name is not analogy; only that through which one compares can be called an analogy; it is a knowledge of similarity.One does not compare anything through the knowledge of the relation between a name and the named as that takes place later. Only after similarity (to the cow) is known certainly, does he make the judgement that 'this is a gavaya'. In this way that (argument ) falls to the ground.

  एवं तर्हि स्यादशब्दपूर्वकं प्रमाणान्तरं, यथा गवयदर्शनादेतत्सदृशो गौरिति ग्रामीणस्य बुद्धिः—तदपि न—प्रमेयाभावात्।सति हि प्रमेये सदुपलम्भकत्वाभिमतस्य प्रमाणस्य व्यापारः,न हि गोगवययोर्व्यावृत्तमनुवृत्तं च वस्तुतः सादृश्यं नामैकमस्ति।

 Objection—In that case let (analogy) be another means of right knowledge not dependent on words. As for instance after seeing a gavaya a villager can have the idea that 'the cow resembles this animal'.

 Answer—Even that is not possible since there is an absence of something sought to be known. Only when there is an object sought to be known can there be the operation of means of true knowledge with the desire to make available something which exists.There is in truth nothing called similarity which distinguishes and also includes everything between the cow and the gavaya.

स्वात्मव्यतिरेकेणासतः सादृश्यस्य प्रतीतौ कारणमिति प्राप्तमवस्तुत्वम्।अथ पुनर्घटादिप्रत्ययवद्वस्तुत्वं प्रमाणत्वं च, तदा स्यादिति ॥  
 Objection—But then, there is the idea of similarity and this does not take place without a support.

 Answer—That is true; but that has to be reflected on i.e., is this something like the idea of a collection like a forest, etc., or is it like the idea of an individual like a pot, etc.

 Objection—What of that?

 Answer—If it is like the idea of a forest then the various trees arranged together in a special way, cause the idea of forest which does not exist without them; similarly the parts of the cow and the gavaya on the basis of the memories of the two which does not exist without the two, is the cause for the idea of similarity; thus we reach something which is unreal.

 But if it is like the idea of an individual pot having both reality and being the means of true knowledge, then let it be.

 तत्र कीदृशं वस्त्विति विचार्यते—

 किं गोगवययोरनुवृत्तमेकं सादृश्यं गोत्वगवयत्वाभ्यामन्यत् ? ते एव वान्योन्यविशिष्टे, यदि वा ताभ्यां भिन्ने गोगवयाधारे द्वे सादृश्ये परस्परानपेक्षे, सापेक्षे वा ?

 किं व्यक्तिरेव साऽन्यतरजातिविशिष्टा वा,किं जातिः,सा चान्यतरव्यक्तिविशिष्टाव्यक्तिद्वयविशिष्टा वा,संबन्धो वैतेषां यथाविकल्पयोगमित्येकैकान्योन्यविशिष्टविशेषणत्वादिना भूयांसोऽन्येऽपि विकल्पा उद्भावयितव्याः । तत्र यद्येकं सादृश्यमुभयगतं, तदा नोपमेयत्वमेकत्वात्, यथा गौरिव गौरिति ॥

 Then one has to find out what kind of a thing it is:  
 1. Is this single similarity found both in the cow and the gavaya different from cowness and gavayatva.  
 2. Or since the two are different from each other, are there two similarities different from the two, having     the cow and gavaya as basis, but (a) not having any connection with each other or (b) having          connection with each other.  
 3. Or is the individual qualified by the universal of the other class?  
 4. Or is it one universal qualified by the individual of the other class.  
 5. Or is it an universal qualified by characteristics of both the individuals.  
 6.Or is it a relation between these;then by combining and separating,there can be a mutual relationship of qualifier and qualified between them and one can also generate many more such options.

 Therein, if there is only one similarity which is referring to both cases then there is nothing to be compared as it is a single thing.Thus one will say 'a cow is like a cow'.

 किं च—

स चाप्यपेक्ष्यमाणो धर्मः किमेकः सादृश्यवदुभयत्र,अथ भिन्न इत्येवमादिविकल्पाः स्युरित्यसम्भवः पूर्ववदेव।

 Objection—

It[^390] can be compared to one of the individuals.

[^390]: "'The similarity."



 Answer—

That cannot be because it refers to itself. Thus (it will read) ‘like a cow because of cowness'.

 Objection—Then let another individual be compared through an individual that has that characteristic.

 Answer—No, that also cannot be. Cowness cannot be the cause for comparing something which has broken horns or which has no horns.

 Objection—Then on the basis of other (different) characteristics, similarity can be the cause for that idea (of comparison).

 Answer—Then similarity will be destroyed. If that idea has such a characteristic, then what is the use of thinking about that which is the destroyer of similarity.

 Moreover, is that characteristic which is the basis, only one and is found in both places like similarity, or is it different—thus there will be these various options; it is thus not possible and the position will be like before.

 अथ भिन्नंसादृश्यमुच्येत– तच्च न–भेदादेव, न हि भवति गौरिवाश्व इति।यथैवैकैकत्वादघटमानता तथा बहुभिरपेक्ष्यमाणैः।एतेन जातिव्यक्तिसम्बन्धादयः पूर्वविकल्पिताः प्रत्युक्ताः ॥

  Objection—Then let us say that similarity is divided.

 Answer—That is also not possible because of the very fact of division. A horse is not like a cow. Since there are many things to consider, taking them one by one makes them unmanageable. By the same argument, the previously mentioned relations between the class and the universal, etc., have been dealt with (in the same way).

 अथ बुद्धयुत्पत्त्यन्यथानुपपत्त्या सादृश्यकल्पना, सत्येवं वनविवरपूर्वदक्षिणोत्तरादिबुद्धियोगा—न्यथानुभवात् \[न्यथानुपपत्त्या\] वस्तुत्वं किं न कल्प्यते । स्यादेषा तव बुद्धिर्वृक्षादय एव तत्र तद्बुद्धिजन्महेतव इति। यद्येवं मिथ्याप्रत्ययो गवयेन सदृशी गौरिति वनबुद्धिवत् ।अथ ये व्यावृत्ताः क इहोपमार्थः गौरिवाश्व इति । अथोभयेऽपि तेऽवयवा व्यावृत्तानुवृत्तात्मानस्तद्बुद्धिहेतवः, तथापि वनप्रत्ययवदेव प्राप्तम् ॥

 Objection—But then, as there is this kind of knowledge and it is not explained in any other way, one has to imagine similarity (as one of the means of true knowledge).

 Answer—Then, in this manner, the spaces that are empty in between the trees in the forest to the front, to the right and to the left are experienced; then why is their existence as reality not imagined (in the same way as similarity).

 Objection—You may understand that in that instance, the cause for the idea of forest are the trees themselves.

 Answer—If it is so, then it is a false idea when one says 'A cow is like a gavaya'; it is similar to the case of the idea of a forest.

 Objection—Amongst those which distinguish one object from another as when one says 'A horse is like a cow', what is it that can be the point for comparison.**¹**

** **Answer—But in both instances^(**2**) there are parts which can be viewed as differentiating or as corresponding to each other, which cause that idea of similarity. Even then

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  

^(**1.**)'It is not possible to compare different things like a horse and a cow as already mentioned. But then opponent says it is possible by saying both are domesticated animals.  
**².**"The instance of the cow and the horse and the instance of the trees, and the forest.



it is like the idea of a forest.

 Therefore, when one examines closely (one sees that) it cannot stand close scrutiny; in both cases there are parts available which create the idea of similarity just as the trees create the idea of a forest. Thus it is proved that analogy is not a separate means of true knowledge.

 नापि प्रमेयद्वित्वात् प्रमाणद्वित्वकल्पनम्।कुतः ? प्रमाणवशादर्थप्रतीतेः।न ह्यर्थवशात् प्रमाणकल्पना।यदि चार्थवशात् प्रमाणकल्पना स्यात्, अधुना तत्र शक्यं जनानामसर्वज्ञत्वात्।चैत्यवन्दनात् स्वर्गो भवतीत्यत्र चैत्यवन्दनस्य स्वर्गहेतुत्वबुद्धेः प्रत्यक्षानुमानाविषयत्वान्मिथ्यात्वं स्यात्।तदर्थं वा प्रमाणान्तरकल्पनम् ॥

 Moreover because there are only two (kinds of) things to be known one need not imagine (only) two means of true knowledge.^(**1**)Why is that so? One knows an object through a means of knowledge but one does not imagine means of knowledge because of the objects. If one starts imagining means of knowledge because of objects, (one sees) it is not possible—for today all the people are not omniscient.^(**2**) For instance in the sentence 'One attains heaven by worshipping in a temple' since the idea that worshipping in a temple causes attainment of heaven is not an object of direct perception or inference it will be false. Or one has to have another means of true knowledge in order to prove that.

 अथ सा बुद्धिरनुमानफलमिति चेत्—प्रमाणादन्यत्र फलप्रसङ्गः एवं श (क) रणत्रयादिवाक्यार्थविषयबुद्धिरपीति ॥

 Objection—But (we say that) that idea is derived from inference.

 Answer—Then there will be the undesirable consequence of the result accruing to something other than a means of true knowledge. In a similar way one can argue that the knowledge pertaining to the object of the meaning of the three refuges**³** can also be obtained.

 In this context the intention is not to determine the characteristic of the means of true knowledge; the main purpose is to indicate the means by which one can restrict the modifications (of the mind) obtained through the well-known means of true knowledge.That is why the Sūtrakāra (Patañjali) did not write sūtras on these (other pramāṇas). As for the
commentator (Vyāsa), he has resorted to repeating some of the well-known means of true knowledge; and following that something has been written on them.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

^(**1**).Objects are of two kinds only directly seen and not directly seen. The two praminas he is talking About now could be that of perception and inference accepted by the Buddhists and Vaisesikas.

^(**2**.) If every object determined its own means of knowledge then only one who is omniscient can achieve that which is not the case in the world.

विपर्ययो मिथ्याज्ञानमतद्रूप प्रतिष्ठम् ॥ ८॥

 Misapprehension is false knowledge (of a thing) which does not correspond to its (real) form.  
 स कस्मात्र प्रमाणम्।यतः प्रमाणेन बाध्यते।भूतार्थविषयत्वात् प्रमाणस्य।तत्र प्रमाणेन बाधनमप्रमाणस्य दृष्टम्।तद्यथा- द्विचन्द्रदर्शनं सद्विषयेणैकचन्द्रदर्शनेन बाध्यत इति ।

 सेयं पञ्चपर्वा भवत्यविद्या,अविद्यास्मितारागद्वेषाभिनिवेशाः क्लेशा इति।एत एव स्वसंज्ञाभिः तमो मोहो महामोहस्तामित्रोऽन्धतामिस्त्र इति।एते चित्तमलप्रसङ्गेनाभिधास्यन्ते ॥८॥

Why is that not true knowledge? Because it is contradicted by a source of true knowledge; since a source of true knowledge has as its object an existent object. In such instances (as viparyaya) it is seen that a false knowledge is contradicted by a source of true knowledge. Thus, for instance, the appearance of two moons is contradicted by the perception of the actually existent one moon.

 This misapprehension is ignorance having five joints which are the afflictions (called) ignorance, sense of ego, attachment, hatred and clinging to life. These same (are known) by their technical names as 'tamah', 'mohah'. 'mahāmohah', 'tāmisrah', and 'andhatāmisraḥ'.These will be explained later in the context of the impurities of the mind (in the second pāda).

 प्रमाणाख्यां वृत्तिं व्याख्याय विपर्ययाभिधानां वृत्तिमिदानीमुपव्याचिख्यासमान आह—विपर्ययो मिथ्याज्ञानमिति ॥

 Having explained the modification known as true knowledge he now mentions the modification known as 'misapprehension' (viparyaya) with a desire to explain it as—viparyayo mithyājñānam, etc.

 ननु निरोधस्य प्रकृतत्वात्तस्य च हानत्वाद्धानस्य च हेयापेक्षत्वाद्धेयस्य चाविद्यामूलत्वादविद्या च विपर्यय इति स एव प्राधान्येन निरोद्धव्यः।तत्प्रभवत्वाद्धेयस्य।कारणनिरोधे हि कार्यमर्थादेव निरुद्धं स्यात्।तस्माद्विपर्ययः प्राधान्यात् प्रमाणात् पूर्वं व्याख्यातव्यः ॥

 Objection—Restriction is the topic under discussion as it is the means to liberation (release). And release is from bondage which is to be avoided;and bondage has avidyā as its basis; and avidyā is misapprehension; therefore it is avidyā which is to be restricted mainly; this is because bondage (or that which is to be avoided for release to take place) rises from that.^(**1**)It is only when the cause is restricted can the effect in fact be restricted. Therefore ‘viparyaya' being important should have been explained before explaining true ( valid) knowledge.**²**

**^(\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_)**  

^(**1**.) Avidya is the root cause for all bindage.  
^(**2**.)Even before talking about pratyaksa, anumana, etc., viparyaya should have been discussed according to the purvapksin.



 Answer—Yes, in truth, viparyaya has great importance as it has to be restricted. Still, the actions of a person with reference to restraint depend on the knowledge of what has merit, and what is defective. The knowledge of what has merit and what is defective is itself true knowledge.Without true knowledge, the defects of viparyaya will not be known; nor will restraint and the means to achieve it be known.Therefore the importance given to the modification of true knowledge is indeed proper. One knows the merits and demerits (only) through true knowledge, so after that, there is the description of viparyaya. With reference to the other remaining modifications (of the mind) viparyaya is more important, this is so because the other modifications have that as their basis and it is only by restricting it can the others be restricted.**¹**

 विपर्ययो मिथ्याज्ञानमिति पर्यायकथनम्।अतद्रूपप्रतिष्ठमिति लक्षणोक्तिः।तस्य रूपं तद्रूपं न तद्रूपमतद्रूपं, यदाभासं विज्ञानं तस्य विज्ञानस्य च सा प्रतिष्ठा आलम्बनम्।अगृहीतविशेषस्य सामान्यमात्रबुद्धिरुपलब्धपूर्वान्यवस्तुस्मृत्युपसंहिता निश्चयाकारेणोपसंहिता निश्चयाकारेणोपजायमाना विपर्ययः ॥

 The words viparyaya and mithyājñānam are synonyms.**²** atatrūpapratiṣṭham is the description of its nature.tatrūpam (true nature) is that nature and that which does not have that nature is atatrūpapratistham;i.e., it appears to be true knowledge and it is the basis of that knowledge.**³** Misapprehension is knowledge in general without grasping the particular (object); it has reference to the memory of something experienced in the past and it is connected with its definite form and arises with an appearance of certainty.

 संशयो ह्युभयोरिदं सामान्यमित्येवं गृहीतसामान्यस्य विशेषमेव बुभुत्समानस्य जायत इति स्मृतावेवान्तर्भवति।यथा स्थाणुः किं वा पुरुष इति गृहीतपूर्वस्यैव विशेषस्य स्मरतः संशयो जायते, न तथा विपर्ययः।अन्यतरस्मरणमात्रेणैवावसितत्वात्।तद्यथा—स्थाणौ पुरस्तादवस्थिते परिणाहारोहणादिसामान्यमात्रोपलम्भेन समुपजातपुरुषस्मरणस्य पुरुष एवायमिति निश्चिता बुद्धिरुत्पद्यते ॥

 When a person sees that there is something common between two things and then he desires to know what that particular thing is then it is called doubt; it comes under memory itself.**⁴** Thus in the case of the doubt 'Is this a pillar or a man' the doubt arises only because of the memory of a particular object already experienced.**⁵** But misapprehension is not like that; it comes about (is determined) by the memory of just one of the things. Thus when a pillar is in front, by grasping only the common properties of breadth, height, etc., there arises the memory of a person (already seen with similar properties) and then an idea of certainty in the form 'This is a man'.

**1**. The others being amita, raga, dvesa, and abhinivesa.

**2**. In the sutra 1.8.

**3**. It is viparyaya which gives rise to that semblance of knowledge.

**4**. There is only one thing but it has some property or properties common to something else and therefore a doubt as to its true identity arises in the mind.

**5**. One must have already seen both a man and a pillar, in order to have this kind of a doubt.



स्मृतिर्जायते यथानुभूतवस्तुविषया। न.विपर्ययस्तथा।सन्निहितसामान्यमात्रे देशकालादिविशेषानुगते वस्तुनि स्मरणपर्यवसानत्वे सत्यप्ययमिति विशेषरूपेण विपर्ययप्रत्ययो जायते।तस्मादेवं न प्रमाणधर्मो नापि स्मृतिधर्म इति वृत्त्यन्तरत्वम् ॥

 Even though that (misapprehension) is brought about mainly through apprehension of some object through the senses, still it is not true knowledge because it is based on the memory of something which has no true form. It is the culmination of memory and "yatah pramānena bādhyate" (it is contradicted by a source of true knowledge) since its object is not true. The object which is remembered is not present at that time[^391]**.**

[^391]: "When a source of true knowledge is functioning, it disappears. "

** **Objection—In that case it is only memory.

 Answer—No— as it is different (from memory). When an object is present (before one) as the cause, then it gives rise to a memory of something else which has already been experienced[^392].But misapprehension is not like that. When an object is present in general (before one) and it culminates in a specific memory of an object associated with a specific time and place then there arises misapprehension of the specific form 'it is this'.Thus this is not the characteristic of true knowledge nor the characteristic of memory; therefore it is another (kind of) modification.

[^392]: " Like when a pillar is present as the cause, the experience of a man had earlier, causes the memory in the form 'this is a man'. "

 तत्राप्रमाणस्य प्रमाणेन बाधसंदर्शनार्थमुदाहरणं दर्शयति—तद्यथा द्विचन्द्रदर्शनमिति॥यथा काचकामलाद्युहतदर्शनस्याभूतार्थविषयत्वाद्धि द्विचन्द्रदर्शनस्य सद्विषयेण भूतार्थविषयेण एकचन्द्रदर्शनेन द्वितीयचन्द्राभावोपपत्तिज्ञानस्मृत्यनुगृहीतेन बाधनम् ॥

 In this context, the commentator gives an example to indicate how a source of true knowledge contradicts false knowledge (through the words) "tadyathā dvicandradarśanam” and so on. A man afflicted by diseases like dim vision, jaundice, etc., sees something which does not exist as, for instance, the case of ‘two moons'—“dvicandra-darśanam"; then through "sadvisayena" = the object which actually exists i.e., "ekacandradarśanena" through seeing the single moon and aided by memory there is contradiction (of the knowledge of two moons) which agrees with the knowledge of the absence of the second moon.

 ननु च द्विचन्द्रमिति द्विपूली पञ्चपूलीतिवत् द्विगुसमासत्वात् 'द्विगुरेकवचनम्' इति प्रतिलब्धे तद्भावात् 'अकारान्तोत्तरपदो द्विगुः स्त्रियामिष्टः'इति द्विगोरकारान्तात् (इति) द्विचन्द्रशब्दादीकारः प्राप्नोति-नैष दोषः-पात्रादिप्रतिषेधात्।तत्र चादिशब्दस्य प्रकारवचनत्वात्।प्रकारस्य च शिष्टप्रयोगानुसारित्वात्,द्विचन्द्रोऽपि पात्रादिषु द्रष्टव्यः।द्वौ चन्द्रौ यस्मिन् दर्शन इति बहुब्रीहिः।एकचन्द्रशब्दस्य अद्विगुत्वादेव चोद्याभावः।

 Objection—But then, the word “dvicandram” is a ‘dvigu' compound like ‘dvipūli', 'pañcapūli', etc., and since there is the sutra 'the dvigu compound is always in the singular[^393]'and further that 'the dvigu which has its last member ending in letter 'a' will take the feminine ending[^394]'

[^393]: " Pāṇ, Aṣṭā., II =.4.1."

[^394]: "  Ibid."

the word 'dvicandra' being a dvigu and ending in the letter 'a' should have the ending in the letter 'i'.





 Answer—This is not a defect as there is the exception to the class of words beginning with ‘pātra[^395]'.By the use of the word, etc., there is reference to a whole class. And the class (of words ) is determined by the usage of the learned; thus 'dvicandra' should be included under the class of 'pātra, etc.'. Its etymological explanation is (as follows), ‘in which vision there are two moons'; thus it is a bahuvrīhi compound. As for the word “ekacandra" the question does not arise at all as it is not a 'dvigu' compound[^396].

[^395]: "Pāṇini himself allows this exception. "

[^396]: "The very definition of dvigu rules that out. "

^(** **)सा च पञ्चपर्वा अविद्या; सा विपर्ययवृत्तिरविद्या पञ्च पर्वाणि अस्या इति।

 “sā ca pañcaparvā avidyā[^397]'—That modification called misapprehension is 'avidya' (ignorance) and it has five parts.

[^397]: "The reading in Vyāsa is "

 In answer to the question as to what those five parts are he says "avidyāsmitā" and so on. “eta eva" = these afflictions called 'avidyā', etc., are well-known “svasamjñabhih” =by their technical names like "tamah”, etc., in other authoritative texts. They will be explained later in the second chapter[^398] in the context of the impurities of the mind—“cittamalaprasangenābhidh āyisyante[^399]".

[^398]: "YS, II.2 and 3. "

[^399]: "The bhāsya has 'abhidhāsyante' whereas the Vivaranakāra quotes it as 'abhidhāyisyante', which is also grammatically suspect. Will Sankara do this?"

**शब्दज्ञानानुपाती वस्तुशून्यो विकल्पः ॥९॥**

 Mental construction is devoid of a corresponding object and is conjured by knowledge which arises from words.

 स न प्रमाणोपारोही,

 न विपर्ययोपारोही च।वस्तुशून्यत्वेऽपि शब्दज्ञानमाहात्म्यनिबन्धनो व्यवहारो दृश्यते\।तद्यथा—“चैतन्यं पुरुषस्य स्वरूपम्” इति\।यदा चितिरेव पुरुषः तदा किमत्र केन व्यपदिश्यते ? भवति च व्यपदेशे वृत्तिः,यथा—“चैत्रस्य गौः " इति।

 तथा, प्रतिषिद्धवस्तुधर्मो\[र्मा\]निष्क्रियः पुरुषः, तिष्ठति बाणः स्थास्यति स्थित इति, गतिनिवृत्तौ धात्वर्थमात्रं गम्यते।तथा, अनुत्पत्तिधर्मा पुरुष इति, उत्पत्तिधर्मस्याभावमात्रमवगम्यते,न पुरुषान्वयी धर्मः।तस्मात् विकल्पितः स धर्मः,तेन चास्ति व्यवहार इति ॥९॥

 It is not included under true knowledge, (and) it is not included under misapprehension. Though it is devoid of a corresponding object, usage based on the strength of the knowledge of words, is seen. Thus for instance 'consciousness is the true nature of puruṣa'. When consciousness itself is puruṣa then what is denoted by what here? (Which is the qualified and which the qualifier?) And there arises a modifica-



tion (of the mind) on (hearing) the utterance, just as (on hearing the utterance) 'Caitra's cow'. Similarly 'puruşa is one without action' and 'one in whom (all) attributes of objects are denied'; 'the arrow is at a standstill’, or ‘it will come to a standstill’ or ‘it was at a standstill.' The bare meaning of the verbal root (stha) is 'not to move' (stand-still). (Here also the words convey a meaning which is not there.) Similarly (from) 'puruṣa is one who has the attribute of not coming into existence' the mere absence of the quality of coming into existence of puruṣa is known and not the presence of some quality in purusa. Therefore, this quality is fancied and as such there is (this kind of) usage.

 इदानीं विकल्पं दर्शयति—शब्दज्ञानानुपाती वस्तुशून्यो विकल्पः॥शब्दस्य ज्ञानं शब्दज्ञानम्, वाच्यवाचकनियमेन साध्वसाधुशब्दज्ञानं,तदनुपतितुं शीलमस्येति शब्दज्ञानानुपाती।वस्तुशून्य इति॥यथा वाच्यार्थशून्यः,यस्य शब्दस्य ज्ञानमनुपतति तस्य शब्दस्य यथाभूताभिधेयेन शून्य इति यावत्।यथाभूतार्थव्यतिरेकेण हि विकल्पनं विकल्पः ॥

 He now mentions 'vikalpa' (mental construction) as 'śabdajñānānupātī vastuśūnyo vikalpah'. The knowledge of the (meaning of) words is knowledge of words i.e, it is the knowledge from words, whether good or bad, which follows as a rule due to the relationship of a word to its [meaning](http://॑# " vācaka being the word and vācya being that which is meant by the word i.e, its meaning.  ").Śabdajñānānupātī is that which has the nature of following verbal knowledge[^400].

[^400]: "This is the etymological explanation of sabdajnanupati."

^(** **)Vastuśūnyah i.e, it is devoid of the object denoted by the meaning of the word i.e., the knowledge from words is devoid of the object denoted by the word itself[^401].Mental construction is the imagining of something different from what actually exists.

[^401]: " In other words one can say that there is no actual corresponding to the denoted meaning of the word. "

 तस्य हि शब्दज्ञानानुपातित्वादागमान्तः पातित्वं प्राप्तम्, अत आह—स न प्रमाणोपारोहीति॥न प्रमाणान्तःपाती वस्तुशून्यत्वात् । न ह्यागमस्य शब्दज्ञानानुपातित्वेऽपि वस्तुशून्यता । यतः शब्दार्थविषया वृत्तिरागमः, विकल्पस्तु वस्तुशून्यत्वान्न प्रमाणम् ॥

 Objection—Since it has the nature of following verbal knowledge, it should be included under scriptural authority[^402].

[^402]: " It should thus be sabdapramana according to the purvapaksin."

  Answer—He (Vyāsa) therefore says “sa na pramānopārohī” i.e., it is not included under true knowledge as it is devoid of any (real) object. In the case of scriptural authority, even when it follows verbal knowledge it is not devoid of (real) objects. Therefore scriptural authority is a modification which has as its object the thing denoted by words; whereas mental construction is not an authority since it has no corresponding (real) object (denoted by the words).

 किञ्च-वक्तृश्रोत्रोश्च तुल्यो विकल्पः।द्वयोरपि शब्दादुच्चरिताद्विकल्प्यैव हि बुद्धिर्जायते।न तथा आगमे।श्रोतुरेव ह्यागमः । वक्ता तु दृष्टानुमितार्थः ॥

  किञ्च-निर्वितर्कसमापन्नस्य विकल्पौ निवर्तते नागमः।तस्मात्र प्रमाणोपारोही \।

  Moreover, mental construction is there equally in both the speaker and the hearer.



In the case of both, when the words are uttered, there arises a mental construction. It is not so in the case of scriptural authority. It is an authority only for the listener. As for the speaker its meaning has been experienced or inferred.  

 Moreover, in the case of one who is in the state of super-deliberative samadhi, there is the cessation of mental construction, but not scriptural authority. Therefore it is not included under true knowledge.

 यद्येवं वस्तुशून्यत्वाद्विपर्ययान्तः पातित्वं प्राप्तम्, अत आह—न विपर्ययोपारोहीति॥कुतः ? शब्दज्ञानानुपातित्वात्।न हि वस्तुशून्यत्वेऽपि विपर्ययः शब्दज्ञानमपेक्षते।यतः “विपर्ययो मिथ्याज्ञानमतद्रूपप्रतिष्ठम्" इत्युक्तम्।प्रमाणपरिच्छेद्यप्रत्ययं प्रत्यतिगुणभूतत्वाच्च विकल्पस्य।न हि यथा सर्वेषां विपर्ययो विरोधाद्वाध्यते, तथा विकल्पः।प्रमाणप्रत्ययगुणभावादेव ॥

 Objection—In that case, since it is devoid of a corresponding (real) object, it can be included under misapprehension.

 Answer—He (Vyāsa) therefore says “na viparyayopārohī i.e., (it is not included under misapprehension); why is that so? Because it follows verbal knowledge. Even when there is no corresponding (real) object, misapprehension does not depend on verbal knowledge.That is why it is said 'viparyayo mithyājñānamatatrūpapratiṣṭ[ham'](http://॑॑॑# " YS, I.8. ").And mental construction goes beyond the ideas (thoughts) which are determined by true knowledge[^403].Mental construction is not like misapprehension which, in the case of everyone, is contradicted due to its being inconsistent (with what is known); mental construction, on the other hand, has the characteristic of thoughts based on right knowledge.

[^403]: "Mental construction thus differs from misapprehension. "

 तस्माद्वस्तुशून्यत्वग्रहणेन शब्दज्ञानानुपातित्वग्रहणेन च परस्परसंबन्धेन प्रमाणविपर्ययाभ्यां प्रमाणविपर्ययगन्धमात्रानुलिप्तमपि भिन्नं विकल्पाख्यं वृत्त्यन्तरं दर्शितम्।तद्वद्गन्धानुलेपनादेव तदानन्तर्येण विकल्पस्यारम्भः।नापि स्मृतित्वम्।स्मृतेः केवलानुभूतास्पदत्वात् ॥

 Thus, as there is a mutual relationship between being devoid of a (real) object and following verbal knowledge, it has been mentioned as a separate modification known as mental construction, different from true knowledge and misapprehension though it has some trace of true knowledge and misapprehension.Having this trace of them colouring it, mental construction commences as a continuation of it. It is not memory as memory has only what has been experienced before as its basis.

 अथ न त्वीदृशी चित्तवृत्तिः प्रसिद्धा।न हि स्वभावं किंचिद्वृत्तिनिमित्तमिति चेदाह—वस्तुशून्यत्वेऽपि शब्दज्ञानमाहात्म्य\[मात्र\] निबन्धनो व्यवहारो दृश्यते इति।मात्रग्रहणं शब्दज्ञानव्यतिरिक्तकारणाभावख्यापनार्थम्।क्व दृश्यत इति चेदाह—तद्यथा चैतन्यं पुरुषस्य स्वरूपमिति।चितिशक्तिरपरिणामिनीत्युक्तत्वाच्चैतन्यमेवपुरुषः, तदेव च स्वरूपमिति व्यतिरेकाभावाद्व्यतिरेकोपनिबन्धनो व्यपदेशो न स्यात्—'पुरुषस्य चैतन्यम्'इति ।

 Objection—It is said that this kind of a modifcation of the mind is not well-known; and the inherent nature of something cannot be caused by the modification of the mind[^404].

[^404]: "There is no fixed form or nature for this modification as it varies with every individual."



  Answer—(Vyāsa says ) that “though it is devoid of a corresponding object, usage based on the strength of verbal knowledge is [seen"](http://॑# "VBh., under YS, I.9. The Vivaranakāra has used the reading “śabdajñānamāhātmyamātra . ..").

 The word "matra" has been used in order to indicate that there is no cause other than verbal knowledge (in the case of mental construction).

 In answer to the question where is it (the usage) seen he (Vyāsa) says "As for instance, consciousness is the true nature of puruṣa". The power of consciousness is without change—this has already been mentioned[^405].Therefore purusa is itself consciousness. When that is its nature without any difference, there cannot be a description based on a difference like the consciousness of purușa[^406]'.

[^405]: "VBh., under YS, I.2. "

[^406]: "Consciousness not being a quality it cannot be attributed to purusa as he is of the nature of consciousness itself. "

** **तथा चेममेवार्थमुपाश्रित्य शब्दविदा वार्तिककारेणोक्तम्—“सिद्धं तु व्यपदेशिवद्भावात्” इति।तथैवेहापि यथा सति व्यतिरेके चैत्रस्य गौरिति तद्वदेव चैतन्यं पुरुषस्येति।न हि यथा गोरन्यश्चैत्रो व्यपदेशहेतुः, तथा चितेरर्थान्तरं पुरुषोऽस्ति, येन व्यपदिश्येत।नापि चितिः पुरुषादर्थान्तरं व्यपदिश्येत।तथाऽपिव्यतिरेकसंबन्धविषये भवति “चैतन्यं पुरुषस्य स्वरूपम्” इति व्यपदेशे वृत्तिः ॥

 Based on this very point the Vārttikakāra who is a scholar of grammar, mentions that 'Something is established by naming its secondary property'. Thus here also, as there is (an awareness of) difference on hearing 'Caitra's cow' so also there is (difference on hearing), 'purusa's caitanya'. But the cow is different and Caitra is the basis for describing (the cow as his); whereas puruṣa is not different from consciousness by which he can be described. Nor can consciousness describe anything other than puruṣa. But when one says 'consciousness is the true nature of puruṣa' it gives the idea of a relationship between different objects; thus in the statement a modification of the mind does take place.

 प्रतिषिद्धवस्तुधर्मेति।वस्तुनो धर्मो वस्तुधर्मः।प्रतिषिद्धो वस्तुधर्मोऽस्येति प्रतिषिद्धवस्तुधर्मा।“धर्मादनिच्केवलात्” इति वचनात् समासान्तश्चिन्त्यसमाधिः।वस्तुशब्देन सत्त्वादिगुणा उच्यन्ते, तेषां धर्माः प्रतिषिद्धा अस्येति ॥

 न हि प्रतिषिद्धाः सत्त्वादिधर्माः ।प्रतिषिद्धत्वादेवास्य पुरुषस्य संबन्धिनो भवन्ति।येन ते पुरुषेण अस्येति व्यपदिश्येरन्।तदभावमात्रमेव तु तत्रार्थः।तथापि यथा चित्रा गावोऽस्येति व्यपदेशे बुद्धिः तथा प्रतिषिद्धा वस्तुधर्मा अस्येति व्यपदेशे बुद्धिः ॥

 “pratisiddhavastudharmā” and so on. ‘vastudharma' is the characteristic of a thing; thus in whom (all) characteristics (properties) of objects are denied is “pratisiddhavastudharmā”. By the sūtra ‘dharmādanic kevalāt[^407]'the word becomes (dharman) 'dharmā' by the samāsānta pratyaya'. By the word “vastu" is mentioned the "gunas" like “sattva”, etc., and their properties are denied in purusa.

[^407]: "Pān. Asta., 5.4.124."

 It cannot be said that by the very fact of denial all the properties of sattva, etc., become related to puruṣa. It only means that these properties which are spoken of as belonging to purușa are simply denied therein. Even then when one says 'He who ha



spotted cows' there is an idea (of possession); so also there is an idea (formed) when one says 'He in whom all properties of objects are denied.'

 निर्गता क्रियाअस्मादित्यत्रापि निर्गतिरपायः।अपायश्च सम्बन्धपूर्वः।यथा चैत्रान्निर्गता क्रिया।न चैवं पुरुषे क्रियाया असम्भवान्निर्गतिः पुरुषात् सम्भवति।तथाऽपि 'निष्क्रियः पुरुष' इति व्यपदेशे भवति वृत्तिः ॥

  Similarly, when one says 'He is one without action', ‘without action' implies disappearance(going away). And disappearance(of action)implies a previous connection as when one says 'Action has departed from Caitra'. But that is not the case here; as there is no action in purușa there cannot be its departure from puruṣa. Even then when one hears the words “niskriyah purusah" there is an idea (formed).

  तथाऽनुत्पत्तिधर्मा पुरुष इति॥ न विद्यते उत्पत्तिधर्मोऽस्येति पूर्ववदेव।अत्र स्वयमेवार्थमाचष्टे भाष्यकारः उत्पत्तिधर्मस्याभाव(ज्ञान) मात्रमव(मत्र) गम्यते।यथा निर्गुणो निरञ्जनो निष्कल इत्येवमादीन्यप्युदाहरणानि।आत्मविषयाने कोदाहरणप्रदर्शनमात्मतत्त्वनिर्धारणार्थत्वात् ॥

  “tathā anutpattidharmā purusa". It can be explained as before i.e.. 'purusa is one who does not have the attribute of coming into existence'. In this case the commentator himself gives the meaning as 'the mere absence of the quality of coming into existence of puruṣa is known and not the presence of some quality in puruṣa'. Similarly he is without guņas; without taints, without parts, are other examples of the same kind. Various examples of the atman are given in order to determine the true nature of the atman.

तिष्ठति बाण इति लोकप्रसिद्धोदाहरणप्रतिपादनमप्रसिद्ध्याशङ्कानिवृत्त्यर्थम्।तिष्ठतीति गतिनिवृत्तिर्गत्यभावः।न चाभावस्य कालत्रययोगो भवति। नापि बाणस्य क्रियानिरपेक्षस्य द्रव्यस्य।नापि चाभावेन गतिनिवृत्त्या बाणस्य वस्तुनः संबन्धः।तिष्ठति बाणः \[स्थास्यति स्थितः \] इत्येवं त्रीण्युदाहरणानि ॥

 He gives the well-known worldly examples of 'The arrow stands still' in order to remove the feeling that the examples (so far given) are not commonly known; 'stands still' is cessation of movement, absence of movement. There is no connection of the threefold [time](http://॑# "Past, present and future.")with absence; nor is the arrow which is a thing, independent of action (have connection with time); nor can the arrow which is a thing have connection with the cessation of movement which is an absence. Thus he gives three examples as “tisthati bānah, sthāsyati, sthitaḥ".

 गतिनिवृत्तौ धात्वर्थ इति॥ ननु गतिनिवृत्तिरेव धात्वर्थः, तत्र कथं गतिनिवृत्तावित्याधारः ? अत एवोदाहरणान्तरमेतत्।असति व्यतिरेके आधाराधेयभावस्याभावात्।अस्ति च गतिनिवृत्तौ धात्वर्थ इति व्यपदेशे शब्दसामर्थ्यसमुत्थापिता बुद्धिराधाराधेय \[भाव\]संबन्धावलम्बिनी।तस्मादित्थंजातीयं विकल्पविषयमनेकमुदाहरणं द्रष्टव्यम् ॥९॥

 "gatinivrttau dhātvartha" and so on.

 Objection—But then the bare meaning of the verbal root (sthā) is 'cessation of movement'; then how is there the usage in the locative case which means a location (a support).



 Answer—That is why this is a different example (given). When there is no difference (between two things) there is no relationship as a supporter and a supported. When there is mention of the meaning of the verbal root as cessation of movement, due to the power of the words, there arises in the mind an idea which has the relationship of a supporter and a supported. Thus this is the nature of mental construction and one can see many examples of this kind.

अभावप्रत्ययालम्बना वृत्तिर्निद्रा ॥१०॥

 Sleep is a modification (of the mind) which has as its support the cause of the negation (of the waking and dream modifications i.e., tamas). Or—Sleep is that modification of the mind based on the absence of any knowledge content.

 सा च सम्प्रबोधे प्रत्यवमर्शात् प्रत्ययविशेषः।कथम्? “सुखमहमस्वाप्सम्, प्रसन्नं मे मनः प्रज्ञां मे विशारदीकरोति” “दुःखमहमस्वाप्सम्,स्त्यानं मे मनो भ्रमत्यनवस्थितम्” “गाढमूढोऽहमस्वाप्सम्, गुरुगुरूणि मे गात्राणि,क्लान्तंमे चित्तम् अलसं मुषितमिव तिष्ठति" इति।स खल्वयं प्रबुद्धस्य प्रत्यवमर्शो न स्यादसति प्रत्ययानुभवे । तदाश्रिताः स्मृतयश्च तद्विषया न स्युः । तस्मात् प्रत्ययविशेषोनिदा।सा च समाधावितरप्रत्ययवन्निरोद्धव्या इति ॥१०॥

 And that sleep appears as a special modification due to (the connecting) memory on awakening from sleep. What kind of a memory is it? 'I have slept well, my mind is calm, it makes my understanding clear; I have slept poorly, my mind is dull, being unsteady it wanders; I have slept in deep stupor, my limbs are heavy, my mind is tired and lazy and appears as if it is stolen.'This kind of memory, in one who has awakened from sleep, is not possible if there were no experience of the modification; nor would the memories based on it have it as its object. Therefore sleep is a special modification. And that is to be restricted like other modifications in samadhi.

 निद्राख्यां वृत्तिमिदानीमाचष्टे—अभावप्रत्ययालम्बना वृत्तिर्निद्रा।जाग्रद्विषयत्वात् प्रागुक्तस्य वृत्तित्रयस्य तदुपमर्देन च निद्रासमुद्भव इति, तदनन्तरं निद्राख्या वृत्तिर्व्याख्यायते॥

 He now explains the modification (of the mind) known as sleep— abhāvapratyayālambanā vṛttirnidrā. The earlier mentioned three [modifications](http://॑# "pramāna, viparyaya and vikalpa. ")pertain to the waking state and on their suppression sleep comes into being; thus after (describing them) the modification called sleep is now being explained[^408]**.**

[^408]: "He describes the sleep state in the logical order, after the waking state."

** **अभाव इति जाग्रद्विषयाभावः, न त्वत्यन्ताभाव एव।तत्र प्रत्ययानुपपत्तेः।अभावे प्रत्ययः अभावप्रत्ययः।स एव आलम्बनं यस्याः सा वृत्तिरभावप्रत्ययालम्बना।सा निद्रा सुषुप्तावस्था ॥

 abhāva is the absence of the waking state, and not absolute non-existence, since in that state there can be no thought whatsoever[^409].The idea in the absence (of the waking state) is abhāvapratyayah and that modification which has that (absence) as its support (ālambanam) is vrttirabhāvapratyayālambanat[^410]^(****)i.e, sleep. That sleep is sound sleep i.e., a dreamless state.

[^409]: "No modification is possible when there is absolute non-existence. "

[^410]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has changed the order of the words in the sūtra putting ‘vṛttiḥ' at the beginning."



 ननु च स्वप्नावस्थाऽपि निद्रैव—नैष दोषः–“स्वप्ननिद्राज्ञानालम्बनं वा” इति सूत्रकारेण भेदेनोपदिष्टत्वादिह सुषुप्तावस्थैव निद्राऽभिप्रेता ॥

  Objection—But then even a dream state is sleep.

 Answer—This is no defect. Since the Sūtrakāra has differentiated between the [two](http://॑ "Between sleep where one dreams and the dreamless state of sleep.  ")in the sūtra svapnanidrājñānālambanam [vā](http://॑॑# "YS, I.38. Or br having as its support a perception in sleep(the mind gains stability). ")he desires to mention here only the sleep which is a dreamless state.

 Moreover it is only the dreamless state that is based on the absence of any knowledge content. The dream state is not based on the absence of any knowledge content but on memory; and memory has something experienced as its object. Thus the commentator indicates what constitutes memory (through the words ) “svapne bhāvitasmartavyā”.[^411]

^(** **)किञ्च—स्वप्नस्य चित्तवृत्तिता स्वसंवेद्येति नाशङ्कैवोपपद्यते।तथा च चित्तवृत्तितामाशङ्क्याह—सा तु\[च सं\] प्रबोधे प्रत्यवमर्शादित्यादि।तस्मात् प्रत्ययविशेषो निद्रा।न ह्यसति प्रत्ययविशेषे परामर्शो युक्तः।अस्ति चायं प्रबुद्धस्य प्रत्यवमर्शः 'सुखमहमस्वाप्सम्' इत्यादिः।प्रत्यवमर्शो नाम किमप्यन्वभूवमिति प्रत्ययालोचना।नानुभवाभावे सा भवेत्।नापि तद्विषयाः स्मृतयो युक्ताः।निद्राया अप्रत्ययत्वे—प्रज्ञां विशारदीकरोति मनः, मनसः कर्तृत्वं, स्त्यानं स्तिमितम् अकर्मण्यम्, गुरुगुरूणीति "प्रकारे गुणवचनस्य” इति द्विर्वचनं गुरुप्रकाराणि, अलसं मुषितमिव मल्लेनापहृतमिव, एतानि प्रत्ययानुभवकार्याणि न स्युः।काश्चन स्मृतयः कानिचित् कार्याणि केचन प्रत्यवमर्शाः। तदेतत्त्रयमपि भाष्यकारोपन्यस्तं प्रत्ययविशेषत्व एवोपपद्यते॥

 किञ्च—गर्भगृहादिषु चादृष्टबाह्यनिमित्तानामसति विशेषे चिरमहं सुप्तवान् क्षिप्रमिति च परामर्शोऽन्यथा न युज्यते॥

 Moreover in the case of dream, since it is known to oneself, there is no doubt about its being a modification of the mind. Thus he (Vyāsa), raising a doubt regarding its (deep sleep's) being a modification of the mind, says “That sleep appears as a special modification due to (the connecting) memory on awakening from sleep". If there had not been this special modification there cannot be the memory (connecting it). There is this memory (reflection) of one who has got up “I have slept well", etc[^412].And reflection is thinking about what one has experienced and it cannot take place in the absence of experience, nor can there be memories regarding it. If sound sleep were not an idea then the sentences, where the mind has agency, like "the mind makes my understanding clear",[^413]"(my mind) is dull" i.e., lazy, without action[^414],"my limbs are heavy",

[^412]: "VBh., under ibid., I.10.  "

[^413]: " Ibid.  "

[^414]: "Ibid. "

here due to the grammatical rule 'prakāre gunavacanasya[^415]'' the repetition of

[^415]: "Pan, Asta., VIII.I.12"



an adjective indicates same kind of heaviness; "(my mind) is tired and appears to be [stolen](http://॑# "VBh., under YS, I.10. ")”— as if it has been taken away by some wrestler-- these effects, which are experiences of that idea, cannot be possible. Some are memories, some are effects and some are reflections. These three, given by the commentator, can only be explained on the basis of the special modification of deep sleep.

  Moreover, when a man sleeping inside the house reflects without any cause from outside, immediately on getting up, that 'I have slept for a long time'—this cannot be explained otherwise.[^416]

** **ननु च नात्र स्मृतयः, स्मृतीनाम् अन्वभवमित्येवंविशिष्टत्वात्।न हि सुषुप्तादुत्थितो विशेषं स्मरति— अत्रोच्यते—बालस्येह जन्मन्यननुभूतस्तन्यसंबन्धस्य जन्मानन्तरमेव तस्याभिलाषो दृश्यते।न च\[स\]--स्वाभाविकः अबालानां स्मृतिपूर्वप्रवृत्तिदर्शनात्।तथेहापि।तस्मात् प्रत्ययपूर्वकः सुषुप्तविषयः प्रत्यवमर्शः, प्रत्यवमर्शत्वात् जाग्रदुपलब्धविषयप्रत्यवमर्शवत्।तथा सुषुप्तोत्थितस्य गात्रगौरवादि कार्यं दुःखाद्यनुभवपूर्वं, गात्रादिविषयगौरवादिकार्यत्वात् प्रसिद्धदुःखानुभवकार्यगात्रगौरववदिति प्रत्ययविशेषो निद्रेति सिद्धम् ॥१०॥

[^416]: "Without admitting the modification of deep sleep. "

 Objection—But then, these are not memories; in the case of memories they are qualified by the thought that 'I have experienced these before'; a person who gets up from deep sleep does not remember anything special.

 Answer—It is mentioned here that in a child who, in this life, has not experienced  
any connection with the mother's breast has the desire for its connection immediately after it is born. It is not something which is natural (since) we have seen that activity is based on memory in the case of adults. Similar is the case here also. Therefore the reflection which has dreamless sleep as its object has some precedent idea; because it has reflection, it is like the reflection of objects experienced during the waking state. Thus in the case of one who has got up from dreamless sleep the effect of heaviness of the body, etc., is because of the earlier experience of pain, etc., as the effect of heaviness, etc., pertains to the object body.[^417]Therefore just as the heaviness of the body is well-known as the effect of the experience of pain so also it is established that dreamless sleep is a special idea.

[^417]: "The experience of pain is translated into heaviness of the body."

अनुभूतविषयासम्प्रमोषः स्मृतिः ॥११॥

 Memory is non-loss (not losing) or not stealing of the objects in the mind which have been once experienced.

 Does the mind remember the (process of) knowledge (of the object) or the object. Knowledge connected with the object (and) shining with the dual form of the object and the (process of) knowledge gives a start to the corresponding subliminal-impression. That subliminal-impression, being awakened by its own sign, gives rise to memory of a dual nature of the object and the (process of) knowledge. With regard to these two, knowledge has the form of the process of knowing as predominant (and) memory has the form of the object as predominant. And that (memory) is of two types: (1) which remembers objects that are imagined (2) which remembers objects that are not imagined. During dreaming, there is memory of objects imagined hereas, during waking there is memory of objects not imagined.

 All these memories arise out of experience of correct knowledge (or) misapprehension (or) fancy (or) sleep (or) memory. And all these memories are of the nature of pleasure, pain or delusion. Pleasure, pain and delusion are to be explained while dealing with afflictions like—Attachment is that which accompanies pleasure', 'Hatred is that which accompanies pain' while 'Delusion is again ignorance'. All these modifications are to be restricted. When these are restricted either 'samprajñāta samadhi' or 'asamprajñāta samādhi' results.

 He now explains memory as anubhūtaviṣayāsampramoṣaḥ smṛtiḥ. As memory is the effect of all the modifications of the mind like true knowledge, etc., it has been mentioned at the end[^418].The meaning of the compound anubhūtaviṣayaḥ is that which has been experienced and is a particular object. That alone is the object which has been already experienced; it is not necessary that what is the object has itself been experienced before[^419].Then the memory which has memory as object will not be a memory, as memory has no quality like sound and so on.[^420]And one desires memory having memory as an object as well, as it is capable of being known to itself. The non-loss of the objects once experienced is its non-stealing, its non-disappearance. Even when the object is hidden, due to its being similar to the experienced object, memory resembles the object as if it is being known.

[^418]: " In YS, I.6 memory is mentioned as the last of the modifications after pramana, viparyaya, and nidra.  "

[^419]: "While memory can only be of things experienced, all the objects need not be experienced before. In this way memory of objects can also take place which cannot be possible if memory is only of experienced objects.  "

[^420]: "Memory of memory is not like that as it has no such qualities as sound, touch, shell and so on, as objects have."

 तत्र प्रत्ययस्मरणयोर्विषयाकारावभासाविशेषात्, किङ्कृतस्तयोर्भेद इति तद्विवेकं प्रदर्शयितुकाम आह—किं प्रत्ययस्य चित्तं स्मरतीत्यादि ॥



 यद्यप्यनुभूताननुभूयमानविषयत्वेनं विवेकः, तथापि सादृश्यनिमित्तां भ्रान्तिं तयोः कार्यकारणत्वप्रदर्शनाय निवर्तयति।एतदेव च वैनाशिकानां बहिरर्थानुपपत्तेर्बुद्धिकारणम्।किं प्रत्ययस्य स्मरतीति कर्मण्युभयत्र षष्ठी।चित्तं स्मरतीति पुरुषकर्तृत्वं निवारयति स्मृतिप्रत्यययोरेककर्तृत्वप्रदर्शनार्थम्।न हि पुरुषस्य प्रत्ययकर्तृत्वं स्मृतिकर्तृत्वं वा।दृश्यत्वात् प्रत्ययानाम्।दृश्यानां च स्वात्मातिरिक्तदृश्यत्वं घटादिवदिति वक्ष्यामः ॥

 In that context, since there is no difference between the appearance of the object in thought and in memory why has this difference been stated? In order to indicate their difference he (Vyāsa) says “kim pratyayasya cittam smarati" and so on.[^421]

 Though there is a difference between that which is already experienced[^422]and that which is not being experienced at present[^423]still the illusion due to their being similar is removed by indicating their causal relationship. The Vaināśika Buddhists, who do not believe in outside objects, mention thought as the only cause."

[^421]: " VBh., under YS, I.11. "

[^422]: " In memory the object is already an experienced one. "

[^423]: "Memory of a thought will be different from the thought in which the experience was taking place. "

 In the sentence "kim pratyayasya smarati", etc., in both places[^424]the genitive has been used to denote the object. By stating that the mind remembers, the agency of the puruṣa is rejected and it also indicates that the mind has both memory and thought[^425].The puruṣa is neither the agent of thought nor of memory, as thoughts are like objects fit to be seen (known). And it will be mentioned that the objects fit to be seen are seen by some other, different from themselves, as in the case of other objects like pot, etc.

[^424]: "Vaināśikas stand for the Buddhists in general. 5.pratyayasya and visayasya in VBh, under YS, I.11. "

[^425]: "The use of the verb in third person singular indicates a single agency. "

 किञ्चातः ? यदि विषयस्य स्मरति, प्रत्ययस्यापि विषयविषयत्वादनर्थान्तरं स्मृतिः प्रत्ययात्।अथ प्रत्ययस्य स्मरति, तदा त्विदमयुक्तम् अनुभूतविषयासम्प्रमोष इति।तदा ह्यनुभवासम्प्रमोष इति स्यात्तत्राह—ग्राह्योपरक्तः ग्राह्यो विषय आलम्बनम् तेनोपरक्तः लाक्षाद्युपरक्तस्फटिकवत्।ग्राह्यग्रहणोभयाकारनिर्भासः ग्राह्यस्य च घटादेः पृथुबुद्ध्नाद्याकारेण स्वेन चावभासरूपेणोपजायमानत्वादुभयनिर्भासः ॥

 Moreover, if the mind remembers the object and if it is also the object of thought then memory is not different from thought. If it remembers the thought (process) then it is not proper to say that memory is the non-loss of that object which is experienced[^426].Then it (the sūtra) should have been the non-loss of the experience'. In that context (Vyāsa) says “grāhyoparaktah" and so on. That which is perceived is the object, the support; coloured by ( connected with ) it like a crystal coloured by something red (near it). "grāhyagrahanobhayākāranirbhāsah " =arises appearing in a dua।  
form like a pot having the shape of a broad base and in its own shining form of knowledge; therefore it shines with this dual aspect.

[^426]: "The sutra itself is being questioned by the pūrvapakṣin."

 स च प्रत्यय उत्पद्य विनिवर्तमानः स्वाश्रये प्रत्ययिनि संस्कारमादधाति।स च संस्कारः कारणानुविधायित्वादुभया(पात)कार एव।स्वव्यञ्जकाञ्जन इति।संस्काराधायिनः प्रत्ययस्य हेतुभूतं यत् कर्म दत्तफलं तत्तुल्यजातीयं यत्कर्मान्तरं फलप्रदानायाभिमुखीभवति तत् स्वव्यञ्जकम्।तथा च वक्ष्यति—'ततस्तद्विपाकानुगुणानामेवाभिव्यक्तिर्वासनानाम्' इति।तत्कर्मप्रत्युपनीतं वा सादृश्यप्रणिधानादि।स्वेन

 And that thought after having come up, while subsiding (disappearing), leaves a latent-impression on its support, the mind.And that latent-impressionfollowing its cause,also has both the forms "svavyañjakāñjanah" = being awakened by its own sign; 'karma' which is the cause of the thought which gives rise to a latent-impression has the result of an action of the same kind which gets ready to give its fruit.

 Thus he will say—tatastadvipākānuguṇānamevābhivyaktirvāsanānām[^427].Or one can say that it has been brought near to the (previous) action or that it has a similar representation. It is awakened by its own sign (cause) so it is “svavyañjakanjanah”, "grāhyagrahaṇātmikām smṛtim janayati[^428]";otherwise the action which makes it appear will not give rise to its result.

[^427]: "'YS, IV.8. As a result of this there is manifestation of only those subliminal-impressions which correspond to the fruition of their karma. "

[^428]: "The reading in all available texts is “grāhyagrahanobhayātmikām..."

 तत्र ग्रहणाकारपूर्वा बुद्धिः ग्रहणम् \[स्वी\]करणं\[स्वी\]करणमेव पूर्वं प्रथममुत्पद्यमानस्य प्रत्ययस्य।न हि विषयविशेषमपेक्षते पूर्वमिष्टानिष्टग्रहणात्, निर्भग्नघटप्रदीपविनिर्गतप्रभाजालवत् ॥

 "tatra grahaṇākārapūrvā buddhiḥ" = Initially it is an acceptance of the thought that is arising i.e., the thought process. This does not depend on the nature of the object and it grasps both the desired and the undesired initially. It is like a jar which is not broken and the light placed inside comes out through holes in it.[^429]

** **ग्राह्याकारपूर्वा स्मृतिः अनुभूतापेक्षत्वात्।यदि च ग्रहणपूर्विका स्मृतिः प्रत्ययवदर्भाविष्यत्, अनुभूतं नापैक्षिष्यत।अपेक्षते तु।तस्माद् ग्राह्यो विषयः पूर्वोऽस्या न ग्रहणम्।तथापि तूभयात्मिकैव।स्मृतिसंस्कारयोरेकरूपत्वात्।नाप्यन्यतरप्रत्याख्यानेन सम्भवति। तथा चानुभूतविषयासम्प्रमोष इत्युपपद्यते।स्मृतिप्रत्यययोरपि\[समान\] विषयत्वात्,ग्रहणत्वस्य च सर्वत्र सम्भवात्।तस्मात् पक्षद्वयेऽप्यभिहितदोषो न दृश्यत इति ॥

[^429]: " There is no direction towards anything specific in that kind of light. So also thought initially grasps in a general way everything seen, without distinguishing them. "

 “grāhyākārapūrvā smrtih" = (memory) depends on what is experienced. If memory were preceded by a knowing process then it would be like an idea (itself) and it would not refer to something experienced; but it does refer to it. Therefore it has the object known as predominant and not the process of knowing. Even then it has a dual nature since both memory and subliminal-impressions have the same nature[^430];and it (memory ) is not possible by rejecting any one of them. Thus it is proper to say that it is the non-loss of the objects that have been experienced. Memory and the thought process can have the same object so it is possible to have the thought process everywhere. Therefore even if both opinions are accepted the defect mentioned is not there.

[^430]: "Cf. YS, IV.9."

“sā ca dvayī”—how is (memory of two kinds) ? “bhāvitasmartavyā” = something which has come into existence because it has been brought into being continuously. It is like oil which is continuously brought into existence (actualised) from another substance. It is because it is obtained continuously that it is not in need of the effort of constant attention. That which is obtained by memory without the help of any other effort like constant attention, etc., that is the memory obtained in dream. During waking there is the need of other effort like constant attention, etc., therefore it is its opposite.

 सर्वाश्च प्रमाणादिवृत्तिपञ्चतयानुभवादुद्भवन्ति।सर्वाश्चैताः सुखाद्या (स्सत्त्वाद्या)त्मिकाः।तदात्मकश्च संसारः।सुखदुःखमोहाश्च क्लेशेषु व्याख्याताः सूत्रकारेण।'सर्वं दुःखं विवेकिनः' इति हि वक्ष्यति ।तद्धानं चेह विवक्षितम्।

 तस्मात् सुखदुःखमोहात्मकत्वात् निरोद्धव्या वृत्तयः।किञ्च—आसां निरोधे सम्प्रज्ञातो वा समाधिर्भवत्यसम्प्रज्ञातो वा ॥११॥

 All these memories come into being from the fivefold modifications of pramāṇa, etc. And all these ( memories) are of the nature of pleasure, pain, etc., which is the nature of the world. And pleasure, pain and delusion are (to be) explained by the Sūtrakāra[^431]when he talks of the afflictions where he will say *To a man of discrimination everything is pain[^432].*And here he desires to mention their removal. Therefore, since they are of the nature of pleasure, pain and delusion the modifications are to be restrained. Moreover, when they are restrained there results either 'samprajñāta samādhi' or ‘asamprajñāta samādhi'.

 अथासां निरोधे क उपाय इति ?

 What is the method for the restriction of the ( different) modification

**अभ्यासवैराग्याभ्यां तन्निरोधः ॥१२॥**

  Their restriction is through practice and through detachment.

 चित्तनदी नाम उभयतोवाहिनी वहति कल्याणाय वहति पापाय च।या तु कैवल्यप्राग्भारा वेकविषयनिम्ना सा कल्याणवहा।संसारप्राग्भारा अविवेकविषयनिम्ना पापवहा।तत्र वैराग्येण विषयस्त्रोतः खिलीक्रियते, विवेकदर्शनाभ्यासेन विवेकस्त्रोत उद्घाठ्यत इत्युभयाधीनश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः ॥१२॥

 The so-called river of mind flows in two directions; it flows towards good and it flows towards evil. That which flows towards liberation, in the downward direction of discriminate-discernment, is flowing towards good; that which is flowing towards  
the world, in the downward direction of ignorance, is flowing towards evil.

 In these cases, the flow towards objects is weakened through detachment, (and) by





the practice of discriminate-discernment, the flow is directed (opened) towards knowledge; thus the restriction of the modifications of the mind depends on the two.

 अथ आसां निरोधे क उपाय इति॥

 "atha āsām nirodhe ka upaya iti"[^433].He explains the means as abhyāsavairāgyābhyām tannirodhaḥ[^434].abhyāsa and vairāgya will be defined (later in the pāda). The various modifications already defined are restricted by those twobecause they oppose them. nirodhah is cessation. The commentary beginning with “cittanadī” and so on, is in order to show that abhyasa and vairāgya have discrimination as their object[^435].

[^433]: "The introduction to YS, I.12, i.e., what is the method for the restraint of these modifications of the mind. "

[^434]: "YS, I.12. "

[^435]: "Sabhyāsa and vairāgya. "

^(** **)Through the mind which is like a river, those in the world are continuously carried towards objects. “samsāraprāgbhārā” = that which has the world as its end, like the river has its end in the sea.[^436]"khilīkriyate" = is obstructed. "udghātyate" = is made to move. Making an opening is to make it move. By the sūtra “mitām hrasvah the long vowel in udghāṭyate would be short but it has been optionally retained in the causative[^437].In this way "ubhayādhinah” = (the restriction of the modification of the mind) depends on the two[^438].

[^436]: "Discrimination between what is real and unreal. "

[^437]: "By the option 'anyathā mitvāt ghatādayah'. "

[^438]: "The two are abhyāsa and vairagya."

तत्र स्थितौ यत्नोऽभ्यासः॥१३॥

 Between the two means, practice is the effort to stay in the restricted state.

 चित्तस्यावृत्तिकस्य प्रशान्तवाहिता स्थितिः।तदर्थः प्रयत्नः वीर्यम् उत्साहः।तत्सम्पिपादयिषया तत्साधनानुष्ठानमभ्यासः॥१३॥

 The restricted state of mind has no modification and flows peacefully; the effort required for attaining that state is 'vīrya' and 'utsāha'. Practice is the following of those means, with the desire to attain that state.

 तत्राभ्यासस्वरूपं प्रतिपादयिष्यन्नाह—तत्र स्थितौ यत्नोऽभ्यासः।तत्र तस्मिन्निरोधे।सा च निमित्तसप्तमी।निरोधनिमित्ता चित्तस्य या स्थितिः यत्नस्य फलभूता तस्या निमित्तो\[त्तभूतो\] यो यत्नः सोऽभ्यासः।तथा चाह—



 अवृत्तिकस्य प्रशान्त \[पङ्क\]कर\[ङ्ग\]ञ्जस्येवाम्भसः प्रशान्तवाहिता प्रसन्नरूपत य परिणामो निरुद्धवृत्तिकस्य चित्तस्य।यत्नो वीर्यमभ्युत्साह इति पर्यायाः।स्थितिसंपिपादयिषया यमनियमादियोगसाधनानुष्ठानमभ्यास इति॥१३ ॥

 In that context, starting to describe the nature of abhyāsa he says tatra sthitau yatno'bhyasaḥ. tatra = in their restraint. sthitau is a locative used in the sense of cause[^439].The steadiness of the mind which is the cause of restraint, is the result effort; and the effort which is its cause[^440]is abhyāsah, constant practice. Thus he (Vyāsa) says "avṛttikasya praśāntavāhita" = like the smooth flow of water which is free of mud it is a transformation of the mind which has its modifications restrained.

[^439]: "Carmaṇi dvīpinam hanti, dantayorhanti kuñjaram, keśeṣu camarīm hanti sīmni puṣkalako hataḥ. "

[^440]: "In other words effort is the constant practice to stay in a restricted state of mind."

 "vīrya" and "utsāha” are synonyms of yatna[^441].And abhyāsa is the practice of the means of yoga like yama, niyama etc[^442]., with the desire to attain the state of (total) restraint.

[^441]: " Courage, exertion, energy, enthusiasm are some of the different meanings of vīrya and utsāha."

[^442]: " Yama, niyama, āsana, prānāyāma, pratyähära, dharanā, dhyåna, and samādhi being the eight means to yoga. Cf. YS, II.29.  "

\[ सतु \] दीर्घकालनैरन्तर्यसत्कारासेवितो दृढभूमिः॥१४॥

 When practised for a long time uninterruptedly and with devotion, it becomes firmly grounded.

 दीर्घकालासेवितः, निरन्तरासेवितः, सत्कारासेवितः—तपसा ब्रह्मचर्येण विद्यया श्रद्धया च सम्पादितः सत्कारवान्, दृढभूमिर्भवति—व्युत्थानसंस्कारेण द्रागित्येवानभिभूतविषय इत्यर्यः ॥१४॥

 When practised for a long time, when practised uninterruptedly, when practised with devotion, when acquired through austerity, through continence, through knowledge and through faith, endowed with devotion, it becomes firmly grounded.Then its object is not suddenly overpowered by an active subliminal-impression.

 How can that state become fixed (permanent)—he answers that question (throughthe words) dirghakalanairantaryasevitaḥ[^443].Practice cannot become firmly grounded unless it is practised for a long time and uninterruptedly. That is why both have been used to qualify it.[^444] The word 'samskārāsevitah[^445].")" qualifies abhyāsa itself. The expla-

[^444]: "To qualify practice."

nation of the word drdhabhumiḥ is connected with a subliminal-impression of action (activity). It means that it is not affected by a subliminal-impression of activity all of a [sudden](http://॑# "The state of restraint is so fixed in the mind that there is no scope of vyutthāna saṁskāra having any effect over it.").

दृष्टानुश्रविकविषयवितृष्णस्य वशीकारसंज्ञा वैराग्यम् ॥१५॥

  Detachment is (technically) called ‘vaśīkāra' which is absence of greed towardsobjects seen and heard of.

  स्त्रियोऽन्नं पानमैश्वर्यमिति दृष्टविषये वितृष्णस्य, स्वर्गवैदेह्यप्रकृतिलयत्वप्नाप्तावानुनविकविषये वितृष्णस्य दिव्यादिव्यविषयसम्प्रयोगेऽपि चित्तस्य विषयदोषदर्शिनः प्रसंख्यानबलात् अनाभोगात्मिकाहेयोपादेयशून्या वशीकारसंज्ञा वैराग्यम्॥१५ ॥

 The detachment of the mind towards seen objects (like) women, food, drink, power&c., (and) absence of greed (of the mind) towards attainment of objects heard of (in the Vedas) like heaven, the state without a body, the state of absorption in prakṛti &c.; perception of defects in objects by the mind due to the power of 'prasamkhyāna' (discriminate-discernment ) even when in contact with divine and worldly objects—(this) is detachment technically called 'vašīkāra' which is of the nature of absence of experience, free from an attitude of avoidance (having to avoid) or acceptance (having to accept).

 वैराग्यप्रतिपादनार्थमाह—दृष्टानुश्रविकविषयवितृष्णस्य वशीकारसंज्ञावैराग्यम्।विषयशब्दः प्रत्येकमभिसंबध्यते वितृष्णस्य इति च, दृष्टविषयवितृष्णस्य आनुश्रविकविषयवितृष्णस्य चेति॥

 In order to describe detachment (vairāgya) he says dṛṣṭānusravikaviṣayavitṛṣṇasya vašīkārasamjñā vairāgyam. The word vişaya (in the sūtra) is individually connected to both dṛṣṭa and anusravika i.e., absence of greed regarding objects seen and absence of greed regarding objects (one has) heard of.

 It is seen and it is an object, that is the meaning of the word 'seen object'. And what is it? With reference to an individual it is women, food, drink and wealth. Though there are endless objects like sound, etc., the attachment to the above is excessive; that is why the possession of women, etc., is mentioned as important objects. There is very strong attachment with reference to them and it has to be got rid of by very strong effort. So also “ānuśravikavisaya" = here it means objects which are heard of from the scriptures. That is the attainment of heaven which is to be experienced (after death), the experience to be got by the attainment of the state of 'prakrtilaya' and that which is to be enjoyed in the state of bodiless state i.e., state of the gods.[^446]


[^446]: " prakrtilaya and videhalaya are technical terms discussed in YS, I.19."


 ननु च वैतृष्ण्यमेव वैराग्यम्, तथा 'रागस्तृष्णा गर्द्धः ' इति हि वक्ष्यति। न—अवस्थाविशेषस्य विवक्षितत्वात्।तथा च यतमानसंज्ञा, व्यतिक्रान्तसंज्ञा, एकेन्द्रियसंज्ञा, वशीकारसंज्ञेति चतसृणामासां सामान्यसंज्ञा वैराग्यमिति।एवं सति दृष्यनुश्रविकविषयवितृष्णस्येत्येतदुक्तं भवति— अधिगतपूर्वावस्थात्रयस्य चतुर्थी या अवस्था सा त्विह वैराग्यमिति विवक्षितम्।तस्मादिह वैतृष्ण्यादन्यवैराग्यमभिप्रेतम् ।

 Objection—But then absence of greed is detachment and Vyāsa will mention later that attachment is greed, or thirst ( for [pleasure](http://॑# "VBh., under YS, II.7. ")).

^(** **)Answer—That is not so; as there is mention of a special state (there[^447]).Thus vairāgya is the common name for the following four states known as yatamāna, vyatikrānta, ekendriya and vašīkāra.

[^447]: "In the case of vaśīkāra it is a special kind of detachment and not just vaitrsnya."

^(**³**)

When it is so, then the statement of absence of greed towards objects seen and heard means that that is detachment which is the fourth state, after having attained the above mentioned three states. Therefore what is intended here is vairāgya (detachment) which is different from absence of greed[^448].

[^448]: "Absence of greed can also be possible when no objects are seen or when one does not know of the existence of some objects. Thus it can be temporary, whereas vairāgya also called vašīkāra is not so. "

^(** **)तथा च दर्शयति—विषयदोषदर्शिनः दोषदर्शनस्य विषयनिवृत्तिहेतुत्वात्।तद्गुणदर्शनं हि रागकारणम्।प्रसंख्यानबलात्—तद्दोषदर्शनाभ्यासबलात्।अनाभोगात्मिका विषयाव्यतिकरात्मिका।दिव्यादिव्ययोः सम्प्रयोगेऽपि हेयोपादेयशून्या रञ्जनावमुक्तस्येव स्फटिकस्य विषयरागविमुक्तस्य चित्तस्यावस्थानम्। वशीकारसंज्ञा—वशीकर्तुं शक्यन्तेऽस्यामवस्थायां सर्वे गौणाः पदार्थाः वशीकर्तव्यत्वेन संज्ञायन्ते, वशीकृतानि च तस्यामवस्थायामिन्द्रियाणि संज्ञायन्ते, वशीकरणं वा संज्ञायतेऽस्यामिति ॥ १५ ॥

 Thus he mentions “visayadosadarśinah” = the awareness of defects can cause detachment towards objects, while seeing their good points causes attachment towards them. “prasamkhyānabalāt" = by the strength of the (constant) practice of seeing their defects. “anābhogātmikā” = a sense of not being in contact with objects (even in their presence). “divyādivyayoh samprayoge' pi heyopādeyaśūnyā" = the state of mind which is free from attachment to objects is like that of a crystal which is free from the colours of (objects) lying near it.[^449]“vaśīkārasamjñā" = since in this state all the objects are capable of being mastered, therefore the objects composed of the gunas are mentioned as being able to be mastered and the sense-organs are considered to have been mastered in that state; or it can be said that in that state one is conscious of mastery

[^449]: "The bhāṣya has 'divyādivyaviṣayasamprayoge. . .' whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has 'divyādivyayoḥ samprayoge ...',"

**तत्परं पुरुषख्यातेर्गुणवैतृष्ण्यम् ॥१६॥**

 That is the highest detachment which results in absence of greed towards the guņas, on account of discernment of purusa.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  

3.The effort to break attachment is yatamāna; the thought that non-attachment towards certain objects has been achieved and towards others it has to be achieved is vyatikrānta also called vyatireka by Vijñānabhikṣu, Vācaspati Miśra and others; when the spent out attachment stays only in the mind with some eagerness it is ekendriya; and when even that is destroyed then it is known as vaśīkāra. Thus vairāgya can be applied commonly to all four states though vašīkāra cannot be so used.



 दृष्टानुश्रविकविषयदोषदर्शी विरक्तः पुरुषदर्शनाभ्यासात् तच्छुद्धिप्रविवेकाप्यायितबुद्धिः गुणेभ्यो व्यक्ताव्यक्तधर्मकेभ्यो विरक्त इति।तद्द्वयं वैराग्यम्।तत्र यदुत्तरं तज्ज्ञानप्रसादमात्रम्।यस्योदये सति योगी प्रत्युदितख्यातिरेवं मन्यते—प्राप्तं प्रापणीयं, क्षीणाः क्षेतव्याः क्लेशाःछिन्त्रः श्लिष्टपर्वा भवसङ्क्रमो यस्याविच्छेदाजनित्वा म्रियते मृत्वा च जायत इति।ज्ञानस्यैव परा काष्ठा वैराग्यम्।एतस्यैव हि नान्तरीयकं कैवल्यम् इति ॥ १६ ॥

 (There is) one, who is detached on seeing defects in objects (which are ) seen and heard of; (and there is another) one who, by practice of discernment of purusa, has his intellect expanded through the consciousness of the pure puruṣa, (and) becomes detached with regard to the gunas having manifested or unmanifested properties. Thus detachment is twofold. Between them, the latter is only clear knowledge (without any object). On the attainment of this state, the yogī, who has obtained this knowledge, reflects thus—that which was to be attained has been attained, the afflictions which were to be destroyed have been destroyed, the succession of existences which has connected joints has been cut asunder, which, if not cut asunder, involves death after birth and birth after death. The uppermost limit of just this knowledge is the (highest) detachment. For liberation (kaivalya) is inseparably connected with this (detachment).

 तच्च द्विविधम्—परं चापरं च विषयनिमित्तभेदेन।अपरं व्याख्यातम्।अधुना परमुच्यते—तत्परं पुरुषख्यातेर्गुणवैतृष्ण्यम्।तदिति वैराग्यं परामृश्यते।परमिति पूर्वोक्तवैराग्यादुत्तरकालभावीति।यदि वा—तस्य विषयनिमित्ताभ्यामुत्कृष्टनिमित्तविषयत्वात्, कैवल्यस्य वा प्रत्यासत्रतरत्वात् परमुत्कृष्टम् ॥

 At that detachment is of two kinds—higher and lower, depending on the object. The lower kind has been [explained](http://॑# "In YS, 1.15 the lower vairāgya has been mentioned. ").He now describes the higher as *tatparāmpuruṣakhyāterguṇavaitṛṣṇyam*. The word tat refers to vairāgya. The word *param* means that it comes after the earlier mentioned vairāgya. Or (it is higher) because both its object and its cause is far superior to the object and cause of the other[^450].****Or it is far superior because it is closer to (the attainment of) kaivalya.

[^450]: "The object in 'apara' is lower and its cause is also absence of greed for the lower objects. "

 किं निमित्तमस्येत्या—पुरुषख्यातेर्निमित्तात्।किंविषयमित्याह—गुणवैतृष्ण्यमिति।गुणेषु सत्त्वादिषु वैतृष्ण्यम्।दृष्टानुश्रविकविषयदोषदर्शीति। पूर्ववैराग्यनिमित्तविषयपरामर्शनमस्य विषयनिमित्तभेदविवेकार्थम्।पुरुषदर्शनाभ्यासात् निमित्तात्।तच्छुद्धिप्रविवेकाप्यायितबुद्धिः।तदिति पुरुषदर्शनं परामृश्यते तस्य शुद्धिः तच्छुद्धिः निर्णिक्तक्लेशादिमलत्वम्।अथवा तस्य पुरुषस्य शुद्धिस्तच्छुद्धिः।तच्छुद्धेस्तदालम्बनदर्शनं प्रविविच्यते।तत्प्रविवेकेनाप्यायिता बुद्धिरस्य योगिनः ॥

 In answer to the question as to what is the cause of this he says *puruṣakhyāteḥ* = the cause is the insight of purușa. In answer to the question as to what is its object he says *gunavaitṛṣṇyam* = absence of attachment to the gunas like sattva, etc[^451]."dṛṣṭānusravikaviṣayadoṣadarśī" = in order to understand the difference between the causal objects of this (and the previous vairāgya) he is describing the causal objects of the previous vairāgya. “purusadarśanābhyāsāt" = by the cause (of the practice) (of

[^451]: "sattva, rajas and tamas. The difference between the objects in the previous vairāgya and this one is brought out clearly here. One is at the gross level whereas here it is at the subtle level."



the insight of purușa); "tacchuddhipravivekāpyāyitabuddhiḥ"; the word "tad" describes the insight of puruṣa; its purity is "tacchuddhiḥ" i.e., free from the taints of afflictions and so on. Or it can be explained as the purity of [purușa](http://॑# "In the first explanation it stands for the insight of puruṣa whereas in the second it stands for purușa itself.")which distinguishes the insight when it (purușa) is the support (of meditation). The mind of the yogi is expanded by this clear insight.

 गुणेभ्य इति विषयप्रतिपादनम्।पूर्वस्तु दृष्टानुश्रविकविषयेभ्यो(ऽपि) विरक्तः।एष तत्कारणेभ्यो गुणेभ्य एव।व्यक्ताव्यक्तधर्मकेभ्यः महदादिसंस्थिता व्यक्तधर्मकाः।प्रधानावस्थिता अव्यक्तधर्मकाः।तेभ्यो विरक्त इति।तत् द्वयं वैराग्यं पूर्वमिदं च।तत्र यदुत्तरं पुरुषदर्शननिमित्तं गुणविषयं तज्ज्ञानप्रसादमात्रम्।पुरुषदर्शनस्यैव परः प्रविवेक इति यावत् ॥

 पुरुषदर्शी हि हेयोपादेयशून्यचित्तो भवति।तदाह—'प्रसंख्यानेऽप्यकुसीदस्य सर्वथा विवेकख्यातेर्धर्ममेघः समाधिः' इति ॥

 By the word "guṇebhyaḥ" he indicates the objects. In the previous case he was detached from objects both seen and heard. Whereas this person (yogī) is detached from their causes, the guṇas themselves. "vyaktāvyaktadharmakebhyaḥ" = those having the manifested properties are mahat, etc., and that having unmanifested properties is pradhana. He is detached from them. "taddvayam vairāgyam” = (there are two kinds of detachment)—the previous one (described in I.15) and this one. "tatra yaduttaram" = the later one which has its cause as the insight of purușa and which has the gunas as its object has "tajjñānaprasādamātram" = the superior clear insight of the vision of puruṣa.

 It is only one who has the insight of puruṣa who has a mind free from the desire of possessing or rejecting something. Thus he says 'prasamkhyāne pyakusīdasya sarvathāvivekakhyāterdharmameghah samādhih[^452] who has uninterrupted discriminate-discernment, there arises the samādhi (oneness) known as 'dharmamegha' (cloud of virtue).

(Superior) vairāgya is clear insight and there is no difference between knowledge and detachment; thus it is established that attachment and ignorance which are their opposites have no difference[^454].In this manner, attachment is also only a different state of ignorance (avidyā) and so the description of avidyā as of five kinds is appropriate[^455].

 Objection—But then, if that is so, the eightfold division of the qualities of the [intellect](http://॑# "Jñāna and ajñāna, vairāgya and avairāgya (rāga), dharma and adharma, aiśvarya and anaiśvarya. ")will be contradicted as only six states based on meditation will be proper[^456].

[^456]: "The six would be based on vitarka, vicāra, asmitā, and ānanda, the first two having two states each. Cf. YS, I.17. Or if jñana becomes vairāgya and rāga becomes ajñāna then only six of the qualities would be left out of the qualities referred, supra, n. 1."

****Answer—Even in knowledge, detachment is of a greater clarity of vision; and attachment is a special state of ignorance[^457].

[^457]: " The Vivaraṇakāra wants to still maintain the distinction between jñāna and vairāgya, and between rāga and ajñāna. "

^(** **)Objection—But then, if that is so, since there are many states of knowledge and ignorance the eightfold division is still not correct.

 Answer—There is no defect as it is based on the result achieved or its opposite[^458].****The four fold states of knowledge, etc[^459]., have results which are different and the states of ignorance, etc., as they oppose (the former) are called the four fold adharma and so on—thus the eightfold division is established. It is the pair of opposites like dharma-adharma, etc., which are described as the qualities and they are all not divisions of ignorance.

[^458]: "The result achieved being kaivalya, and its opposite being non-achievement of kaivalya."

[^459]: " Knowledge, detachment, virtue, and power."

** अथोपायद्वयेन निरुद्धचित्तवृत्तेः कथमुच्यते सम्प्रज्ञातः समाधिरिति**

** **When the modifications of the mind have been restricted by the two means (of practice and detachment) what is the description of the ensuing 'samprajñāta samādhi?'

**वितर्कविचारानन्दास्मितारूपानुगमात् सम्प्रज्ञातः॥१७॥**

 Samprajñāta (samādhi ) is that accompanied by deliberation (or) by reflection (or) by bliss (or) by sense of ‘I'.

  वितर्कः—चित्तस्य आलम्बने स्थूल आभोगः।सूक्ष्मो विचारः आनन्दो ह्लादः।एकात्मिका संवित् अस्मिता।

 तत्र प्रथमः चतुष्टयानुगतः समाधिः सवितर्कः।द्वितीयो वितर्कविकलः सविचारः।तृतीयो विचारविकलः सानन्दः।चतुर्थः तद्विकलोऽस्मितामात्र इति।सर्व एते सालम्बनाः समाधयः॥१७॥

 With regard to its support the mind's direct perception of the essence of the gross object (is samprajñāta accompanied by deliberation). (Samprajñāta accompanied by) reflection is (the direct perception of the essence of) the subtle object; (samprajñāta



accompanied by) bliss is happiness; (samprajñāta accompanied by) feeling of I-ness is the knowledge of the essence of mere 'I'.

 Of these four, the first, which is accompanied by all the four, is (samprajñāta) ‘samādhi' accompanied by deliberation. The second, devoid of deliberation, is (samprajñāta) accompanied by reflection. The third, devoid of reflection (and deliberation) is (samprajñāta) accompanied by bliss. The fourth, devoid of that, is mere 'I-ness'. All these kinds of 'samādhi' have an object of support.

 It has been mentioned earlier that samprajñāta samādhi will be described later as accompanied by vitarka and so on[^460].Having got the opportunity he defines them now. "upāyadvayena niruddhavrtteh" and so on. The two kinds of detachment, both inferior and superior, have been defined. By implication practice also has two divisions[^461].How (what) is this division? The sutra itself will mention the practice of the superior asamprajñāta-samādhi as *virāmapratyayābhyāsapūrvaḥ[^462] and which has (only) the subliminal-impressions as residue, is the other ( asamprajñāta )'.")*.From that it follows certainly that there is another previous practice having an object as support. He will also mention *tatpratiṣedhārtham ekatattvābhyāsaḥ[^463] (there should be) practice on a single entity. ")*.[^463] (there should be) practice on a single entity. ")

 The commentator has also said “vairāgyena visayasrotah khilīkriyate”, “vivekadarśanābhyāsena kalyāṇasrotaḥ udghāṭyate[^465]".He did not mention that samprajñāta-samādhi is the rejection of the modifications (of the mind).[^466]The restriction of all the modifications is to begin only after there is withdrawal of the mind from engaging with undesired objects and it is a modification accompanied by a special object[^467].

[^465]: "VBh., on YS, I.12. The flow towards objects is weakened through detachment'. "

[^466]: "Ibid. 'By the practice of insight the flow is opened towards knowledge'. While the reading is ‘vivekasrotah' the Vivaranakāra uses the word 'kalyānasrotah'."

[^467]: "Total restraint has its object as the cessation of all modifications. "

^(****) Thus in the second sūtra it has been mentioned that the definition of samprajñāta-samādhi is not total restraint[^468].Therefore he (Vyāsa ) asks the question—“When the modifications of the mind have been restricted by the two means (of practice and

[^468]: "Cf. YS, I.2."



detachment) what is the nature of the ensuing samprajñāta-[samādhi](http://॑# "Introduction to sutra 17. ")''i.e., what is its description.

 *vitarkavicārānandāsmitārūpānugamāt* *samprajñātaḥ*. The word anugama has to be connected with each of the words (preceding[^469]),i.e. accompanied by deliberation, (or) by reflection, (or) by bliss (or) by only the sense-of-I. The word rūpa is in the sense of 'only', indicating that the earlier three like vitarka, etc., have ceased to be.[^470]

[^469]: "  Each of the words vitarka, vicara, ananda, and asmita is connected with anugama.  "

^(** **)वितर्कश्चित्तस्यालम्बने स्थूल आभोगः।स्थूल(पि) मिश्रीभावः प्रथममालम्बनाकारेण परिणममानस्य चित्तस्य य आलम्बनव्यतिकरः स वितर्कः ॥ सूक्ष्मो विचारः आभोगः सूक्ष्म इति संबन्धः।आनन्दो ह्लादः विचारः सूक्ष्मतर आभोगस्तृतीयः।सानन्दता विशेषः।एकरूपात्मिका संविदस्मिता स्वस्यां प्रकृतावस्मितायां समापत्रस्य अस्मिता प्रत्ययमात्रता एकरूपात्मकत्वम्।तथा चोदाहरिष्यति—तमणुमात्मानमन्ववैत्यास्मीत्येतावत्संजानीत इति ॥

[^470]: "Thus rupa according to the Vivarnakara is connected only with asmita and not with the other three Misra has a different explanation for the usage of the word rupa, while Bhiksu thinks that the word rupa should be discarded as it is a mistake. "

 "vitarkaścittasyālambane sthūla abhogaḥ" = the mind which is transformed into the form of its object which is gross and somewhat mixed in the first stage, which is not different from the object of support, is that accompanied by deliberation (verbal association). "sūksmo vicārah" —the connection is that the transformation (direct perception) is (here) subtle[^471]."ānando hlādah" = that reflection and transformation which is more subtle is the third. It is characterised by bliss. "ekarūpātmikā samvidasmitā”= this is the stage when the mind is one with its own nature, the sense-of -I, which has the idea of only the 'I-sense' i.e., of being a mere self-hood. He will later give the example[^472]— 'Pondering on that ātman which is a mere atom (the yogī) realises himself in the form I-am'.[^473]

[^471]: " In vicaranugamah or that accompanied by reflection.  "

[^472]: "Cf. VBh., under YS, 1.36. "

^(** **)ननु चास्मितां क्लेशेषु पठिष्यति 'दृग्दर्शनशक्त्योरेकात्मतेवास्मिता' इति।तत्कथमिवास्मितारूपेण क्लशेन समाधिरनुगम्यत इति।सत्यमेवं—प्रकृष्टस्वकारणाकारावभासकत्वादन्यविषयविनिवृत्तात्मक त्वाच्चास्मितायाः समाधिरूपत्वेऽप्यदोषः ॥

[^473]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has a different reading. The reading in VBh. is 'tamaṇumātramātmānamanuvidyāsmītyeva --m tāvatsamprajānīte'. "

 Objection—But then, asmitā (sense-of-I) will be mentioned under the afflictions as 'Asmita is the feeling of identity between the power of seeing and the power by which one sees[^474]'.^(****)So how can samadhi be connected with an affliction in the form of the 'sense-of-I'.

[^474]: "YS, II.6."



 Answer—That is true. But in that state there is (1) the appearance of the form of one's own superior cause (2) there is the disappearance of all other objects (3) there is the feeling of self-hood-therefore, there is no defect in accepting it as a form ofsamādhi.

 यदि वा अस्मितारूपस्यालम्बनस्याविद्यात्वेऽपि न योगिप्रत्ययस्याविद्यात्वम्।न हि खलु परचित्तविविदिषायां परस्याविद्यात्वम्। न हि खलु परचित्तप्रत्ययं गृह्णन् परकीयाविद्याप्रत्ययरूपालम्बनदोषेण स्वयमविद्यावान् भवति ॥

 यः पुनः केशः स विपर्ययविशिष्ट एव।यथा— अहं गच्छामि कृशोऽहमिति।योगिचित्तस्य तन्न्यग्भूते रजस्तमसी इति न तथा ॥

 Even though the support ( of meditation ) in the form of the 'I-sense' does have ignorance still the yogī's thought does not have ignorance (in it ). For instance, when one (a yogi) desires to know another's mind he does not take on the ignorance of the other. When one receives (reads) the thought of another mind he does not himself become ignorant because of the defect of the support in the form of the other's ignorant thought.¹[^475]

 Moreover an affliction is qualified by misapprehension, as for instance, in such statements as ‘I go' or 'Tam thin'. 2[^476] And a yogī's mind is not like that as both rajas and tamas have been overcome in it.

[^475]: "It is interesting to note the reference to telepathy here."

[^476]: " "

 तत्र पूर्वः पूर्वः स्वकीयोत्तरोत्तरधर्मानुगतः।परः परस्तु पूर्वपूर्वधर्मविकलः।यस्माच्चैतद्धर्मचतुष्टयानुगत एवायं सम्प्रज्ञातः समाधिस्तस्मादेतल्लक्षण इति लक्षणार्थं सूत्रम्।लोकेऽपि यो यदसाधारणधर्मानुयातः स तल्लक्षणः, यथा सास्त्रादिलक्षणो गौरिति \।\।  
 Of these, the earlier ones are associated with all the characteristics of the following ones;3[^477] whereas, the later ones are devoid of the characteristics of the earlier ones. 4[^478] Thus, since samprajñāta-samādhi is only accompanied by these four characteristics therefore, this sūtra[^479] is given in order to define it in terms of (the four characteristics). Even in ordinary usage an object is defined by its special charact eristic as for instance when one says 'A cow is that which has a dew lap, etc.6[^476]

[^477]: "Thus vitarka will be followed by all four, vitarka, vicāra, ananda, and asmitā."

[^476]: " "

[^478]: " *Thus vicāra will be devoid of vitarka, ananda of both vicara and vitarka and asmitā of all the earlier three."

 By the usage of 'mere sense-of-I' one should not have the doubt that these samadhis are without support (or one of the samādhis is without support) — therefore he (Vyāsa) says "sarva ete sālambanāḥ". One might again think that asmitā is devoid of thought but that is not true because the meaning of the word asmitā is well-known as 'ego'.Thus it is said (that) the idea of being (I am) is the sense-of-I.



tion of modifications and by having only the subliminal-impressions as residue. Which is that which is qualified by these two ? He says (it is) anya (the other).

 विरमणं विरामः।विरामश्चासौ प्रत्ययश्च विरामप्रत्ययः।विरामरूपत्वात् स एव प्रत्ययो विराम इत्युच्यते।सर्वविषयेभ्यो विनिवर्तमानस्य विनिवर्तनकाले प्रागप्रत्ययापत्तेः प्रत्ययरूपत्वम्।एतद्यथा— पावकस्य ज्वलतः प्रक्षीयमाणेन्धनस्य शनैश्शनैरुपशाम्यतः प्रागङ्गारतापत्तेर्ज्वालात्मकता ॥

 तस्माद्विरामरूपः प्रत्ययो विरामप्रत्ययः तस्य अभ्यासः पूर्वो मुखं यस्य सः विरामप्रत्ययाभ्यासपूर्वः।संस्कार एव शेषो यस्य स संस्कारशेषः।प्रत्ययोपरमे तु प्रत्ययसंस्कार एवावशिष्यते।विषयप्रत्ययेभ्य उपरतं चित्तं संस्कारशेषमेवेत्यर्थः।तस्य परं वैराग्यमुपायः तस्य समाधेः परमुत्तरम् ॥

 Cessation is virāmaḥ. That which is an idea and which is cessation is the cessation of idea, virāmapratyayaḥ. As it has the form of cessation one says that the idea itself has ceased. When the mind is being withdrawn from all objects, at the time of withdrawal, before attaining the state of (having) no idea, it still has the form of (having) an idea. This is like a fire which has burning bright flames; then when the firewood is being used up it goes down little by little and just before reac -hing a state of being just ashes it still has the nature of being a flame of light.

 Therefore, the idea which has the form of cessation is virāmapratyayaḥ; that which has the practice of it preceding it is virāmapratyayābhyāsapūrvaḥ. That which has only the samskāras as residue is samskāraseṣaḥ. When there is cessation of ideas then the subliminal-impressions of ideas alone remain i.e., the mind which has ceased to have thoughts regarding objects is one with the subliminal impressions alone as residue. “tasya param vairāgyamupāyah" = the means to that samādhi is a higher (detachment) (which comes after the inferior detachment).

 Objection—But then, higher detachment also should have been mentioned^(1[^481]) as there is the idea of restraint of modifications through practice and detachment.

[^481]: "'The pūrvapakṣin wants this also to be mentioned here as in sūtra 1.12. Both abhyasa and vairāgya have already been mentioned as means to samādhi."

 Answer—This is no defect. As the sūtra mentions the practice of cessation of thought there is no doubt about its practice; and because the mention of detachment is not there one doubts it. But since that (cessation of thought) itself is brought about 'ca' (also) has not been mentioned (in the sūtra).

 Objection — If that is so why did not the sūtra itself mention vairāgya?

 Answer—It has already been mentioned earlier. 2[^482]

 Objection – Why was it mentioned there?

[^482]: "Cf. YS, I.16."

 Answer—Because he was dealing with detachment there. The later detachmentwas mentioned in that context, as being later, as it was distinct from the earlier



detachment. The earlier detachment is used having samprajñāta samadhi as its object; therefore the later detachment which remains as a means and has another as its object can have its connection only with the seedless-samādhi; therefore there is no mention of (superior) detachment in the sūtra. That which is implied is indicated by the commentator (Vyāsa).

 'अभ्यासवैराग्याभ्यां तन्निरोध' इति हि प्रतिपादितम्।सालम्बनो ह्यभ्यासो विरुद्धत्वान्निरालम्बनस्य समाधेः साधनत्वाय न कल्पत इति निर्वस्तुकोऽपि विरामप्रत्ययो निरालम्बनसमाध्यनुरूपत्वादालम्बनी क्रियते।तस्मात्तदभ्यासवैराग्योपायपूर्वकं चित्तं निरालम्बनमभावप्राप्तमिव भवति।स एष निर्बीज़ः संस्कारशेषस्वभावः समाधिरसम्प्रज्ञात इति ॥१८॥

 abhyāsavairāgyābhyām tannirodhah[^483] has been mentioned. Practice of (detachment) having a support is opposed to the accomplishment of the samadhi having no support. Therefore "nirvastuko pi virāmapratyayo ālambanīkriyate" = the cessation of all modifications which has no object is made its support. Therefore, the mind preceded by practice and (superior) detachment, being without support, appears as if it were non-existent; thus this samādhi, having no seed is asamprajñāta

[^483]: "YS, I.12."

**स खल्वयं द्विविधः – उपायप्रत्ययो भवप्रत्ययश्च।तत्रोपायप्रत्ययो योगिनां भवति**

 This same ‘asamprajñāta samādhi' is of two kinds—'upāyapratyaya' and 'bhava-pratyaya'. Between the two, upāyapratyaya' belongs to yogis

**भवप्रत्ययो विदेहप्रकृतिलयानाम् ॥१९॥**

** **‘Bhavapratyaya’ belongs to the ‘videhas' (those without bodies, gods) and to the ‘prakrtilayas' (those absorbed in prakrti).

 विदेहानां देवानां भवप्रत्ययः।ते हि स्वसंस्कारमात्रोप(यो) भोगेन चित्तेन कैवल्यपदमिवानुभवन्तः स्वसंस्कारविपाकं तथाजातीयकमतिवाहयन्ति।तथा प्रकृतिलयाः साधिकारे चेतसि प्रकृतिलीने कैवल्यपदमिवानुभवन्ति, यावन्न पुनरावर्तते ऽधिकारवशाच्चित्तम् इति ॥१९॥

 'Bhavapratyaya' belongs to the 'videhas' i.e., gods. They, indeed, with their minds, which has only their subliminal-impressions left, enjoy the state of liberation, as it were, and when their subliminal-impressions are fructified they cross over that kind of subliminal-impressions.

 Similarly, those absorbed in prakṛti, experience the state of liberation as it were, during which the mind which ( still) has its power, is absorbed in prakrti. They ( stay in that state) till such time as the mind, due to its power (of giving rise to effects), does not return.

 स खल्वयं द्विविधः।सः निर्बीजः समाधिः उपायप्रत्ययो भवप्रत्ययश्च।उपायेन प्रतीयते प्राप्यत इत्युपायप्रत्ययो योगिनां भवति।यद्यपि विदेहा अपि योगिन एव।तथापि यमादियोगसाधनानुष्ठायि -नोऽभिप्रेताः।तेषां श्रद्धावीर्याद्युपायलभ्यः समाधिः ॥



 “sa khalvayam dvividhah”[^484] = This seedless samādhi is (of two kinds called) “upāyapratyaya” and “bhavapratyayaśca”[^485]. That which is obtained by some means is “upāyapratyaya” and it belongs to yogīs. Even though those without bodies (videhas, gods) are also yogis still, the reference here is to those who follow the means to yoga like yama, etc. Their[^486] samādhi is obtained through the means of Śraddhā, virya and so on.[^487]

[^484]: "'The introduction to YS, I. 19."

[^485]: "²Ibid."

[^486]: " The samadhi of the yogis."

[^487]: " Cf. YS, I.20."

 videhaprakrtilayānām – (seedless-samādhi) belongs to the videhalayas, and prakrtilayas, by birth itself. They have very little obstructions left. And that left-over obstruction is not capable of destroying the samadhi of those whose next birth has been brought into being at once[^488]; it is only the cause for obtaining the (next) birth. Since the state of videhalaya and prakṛtilaya are the effects of the practice of discriminate-discernment and detachment, the sūtra[^489]is in praise of their practice, i.e.,this is the importance of their practice. It also means that if there is some imperfec -tion in the practice then even if the desired result[^490]is not attained, the great states of videhalaya and prakṛtilaya are obtained.

[^488]: "The karmaphala has exhausted itself in giving rise to a next birth but has no further potential to destroy the samprajñāta samādhi already attained in the previous birth."

[^489]: "6YS, I.19."

[^490]: "The desired state is kaivalya, the other states being inferior to it."

 Videha are the gods who have no bodies; i.e., connection with the body's eight elements. "te svasamskāramātropabhogena cittena kaivalyamihānubhavantah" =through the mind which has only the subliminal-impressions as residue strengthened due to detachment and constant practice, and experiencing only the samskāras (they enjoy, as it were, the state of liberation ). By the dropping off of the sattva-guna, “svasamskāravipākam tathājātīyakam" (ativāhayanti) = when their subliminal-impressions have fructified, they cast it away.“prakrtilayāh" = they have some work left to be fulfilled. Till such time as the knowledge of the difference between the guṇas and puruṣa has not arisen, the mind



has not fulfilled its task and when in that state it gets absorbed in prakṛti, it enjoys the state of liberation, as it were, as in the case of the videhas. "yāvanna punarāvartate'-dhikāravaśāt" = due to the necessity of acquiring knowledge (of the difference between prakrti and purusa) they experience liberation, as it were, (till knowledge dawns).

**श्रद्धावीर्यस्मृतिसमाधिप्रज्ञापूर्वक इतरेषाम्॥२०॥**

 To the others belong that (asamprajñāta samādhi) which is preceded by faith, energy, memory, meditation and discernment (prajña).

 उपायप्रत्ययो योगिनां भवति।श्रद्धा चेतसः सम्प्रसादः।सा हि जननीव कल्याणी योगिनं पाति।तस्य हि श्रद्दधानस्य विवेकार्थिनो वीर्यमुपजायते।समुपजातवीर्यस्य स्मृतिरुपतिष्ठते।स्मृत्युपस्थाने च चित्तमनाकुलं समाधीयते।समाहितचित्तस्य प्रज्ञाविवेक उपावर्तते, येन यथार्थं वस्तु जानाति।तदभ्यासात्तद्विषयाच्च वैराग्यात् असम्प्रज्ञातः समाधिर्भवति॥ २०॥

 Upāyapratyaya belongs to yogis.

 Faith is clarity of the mind. She, like a good mother, protects the yogi. Energy comes to him who has faith (and) who is searching for discernment. Memory arises in one who has obtained energy.

 When memory is present the mind becomes capable of meditation without distractions. The concentrated mind attains discriminate-discernment known as prajña', through which one perceives the object as it truly is. By the practice of (prajña) and through (superior) detachment which is its aim, ‘asamprajñāta samādhi' comes into being.

 येषामुपायप्रत्ययो योगिनां तेषां श्रद्धावीर्यस्मृतिसमाधिप्रज्ञापूर्वकः समाधिः, श्रद्धा नामापवर्गप्राप्तौ तत्साधनश्रवणे च कतकफलसंपर्क इव सलिलस्य चेतसः \[सम्प्रसादः\] संप्रसत्तिः।सा हि जननीव कल्याणी योगिनं पाति रक्षत्यशुमेभ्यः।तस्य हि विवेकार्थिनः सम्यग्दर्शनार्थिनो वीर्यम् उत्साह उपजायते योगसाधनानुष्ठानं प्रति।सञ्जातवीर्यस्यागमज्ञानादिविषया दृढतरा स्मृतिरुपतिष्ठते।विवेकार्थिन इति सर्वत्रानुषज्यते॥

 As regards those yogis (who attain asamprajñāta) through ( some) means, their samādhi is preceded by śraddhāvīryasmṛtisamādhiprajñāpūrvakaḥ.[^491]' śruddhā is a clarity of the mind with regard to the attainment of liberation and with regard to listening to the means to it; it is like the clarity of water when it is in contact with the kataka-fruit[^492].2 That ‘‘sā hi jananīva kalyāni yoginam pāti" = protects the yogī (like a mother) from bad things[^493].“tasya hi” = and to such a one, “vivekārthinah” = who is searching for discernment, “viryamupajāyate" = comes energy (great effort) with regard to the practice of the means to yoga. And when he has obtained energy, there arises very strong memory pertaining to scriptural knowledge[^494]. The word "vivekārthinah" is to

[^491]: "It is preceded by śraddhā, vīrya, smṛti, samādhi, and prajñā. Each of these terms will be explained by the commentator."

[^492]: " This fruit is traditionally considered capable of clearing muddy water and making it clean."

[^493]: "³From bad thoughts, bad words and bad action. Faith is capable of protecting the yogi from this."

[^494]: "'Miśra and Bhiksu connect each of the words śraddhā, vīrya, smrti, samādhi, and prajñā to the eight means of yoga. The Vivaraṇakāra just leaves them as they are. It thus appears to be following a local tradition."



be connected everywhere.[^495]

 दृढस्मृत्युपस्थाने च चित्तमनाकुलं समाधीयते।समाहितचित्तस्य प्रज्ञाया बुद्धेः विविक्तता सर्वार्थप्रकाश -नसामर्थ्यम्। त(था ) त् विशिनष्टि – येन यथाभूतम् आत्मादि वस्तु जानाति इति॥

[^495]: "To each stage, like śraddhā, vīrya, etc."

 “drdhasmrtyupasthāne ca cittamanākulam samādhāyate[^496] = ( when there is firm memory, the mind becomes concentrated (capable of meditation) without distraction). “samāhitacittasya" = the mind which is in samādhi attains a clarity of intellect (knowledge) which is capable of illumining everything. He explains that as "yena yathābhūtam vastu jānāti"[^497]3 = by that he knows objects like the ātman, etc., ( as they really are).

[^496]: " The reading in the bhāsya is “ smrtyupas—"

[^497]: " The reading in the bhāṣya is "

 "tadabhyāsāt tadviṣayācca vairāgyādasamprajñātaḥ samādhiḥ" = by the practice of vision of the atman, by practice of cessation of modifications and through superior-detachment, asamprajñāta samādhi comes into being.

 ते खलु नव योगिनो भवन्ति मृदुमध्याधिमात्रोपायाः।तद्यथा—मृदूपायो मध्योपायोऽधिमात्रोपाय इति।तत्र मृदूपायस्त्रिविधः-मृदुसंवेगो मध्यसंवेगस्तीव्रसंवेग इति।तथा मध्योपायस्तथाऽधिमात्रोपाय इति।तत्राधिमात्रोपायानाम्—

 These yogis are of nine kinds as followers of the gentle means, middling (average) means and extreme means; that is to say, the follower of the gentle means, the follower of the middling (average) means and the follower of the extreme means. Amongst them the follower of the gentle means is (also ) of three types — with gentle intensity, with middling (average) intensity (and) with keen intensity. Similarly the follower of middling means ( is of three types); similarly the follower of extreme means ( is of three types). Amongst them for the followers of the extreme method

**तीव्रसंवेगानामासन्नः॥२१॥**

 With keen intensity ( samādhi ) is nearest.

 समाधिलाभः समाधिफलं च भवतीति॥

 There is the gain of 'samādhi' and the result (kaivalya = liberation) of samādhi as well.

 तेऽपि श्रद्धादिसाधना नव (नुप) योगिनो भवन्ति।तद्दर्शयति—तद्यथा मृदूपायो मध्योपायोऽधिमात्रोपाय इति।तेषामेकैकस्त्रिधा भिद्यते – तत्र मृदूपाय इति।साधनानुष्ठानं प्रति मन्दोपक्रमो मध्योपक्रमः ती(व्रसंवेगो)व्रोपक्रम इति।एवमितरत्रापीति।नात्र तिरोभूतम् (त्)।

 तत्राधिमात्रेपायानां तीव्रसंवेगानामासत्रः समाधिलाभः समाधिफलं च॥२१॥



 Those yogis who follow the means of śraddhā, etc., are of nine kinds. That is mentioned as "tadyathā mṛdūpāyo madhyopāyo' dhimatropāya iti". And each of the above[^498]' is (further) divided into three kinds = "tatra mrdūpāya” and so on. This division is with reference to the practice of the means as that whose progress is slow,average or great. And the same division applies in the other cases as well;³[^499] and it is not hidden[^500].

[^498]: "mrdu, madhya and tīvra. This is mentioned in the introduction to sūtra I.21."

[^499]: " Cf. supra, n. 2."

[^500]: "“Everything is very clear."

 “tatrādhimātropāyānām", tīvrasamvegānāmāsannah "samādhilābhah samādhipha -lam ca".[^501]

**मृदुमध्याधिमात्रत्वात्ततोऽपि विशेषः ॥२२॥**

[^501]: "  "

 Because this keenness is gentle, middling and extreme there is a further difference ( in gaining samādhi and in the result of samādhi).

मृदुतीव्रो मध्यतीव्रोऽधिमात्रतीव्र इति।ततोऽपि विशेषः तद्विशेषादपि, मृदुतीव्रसंवेगस्यासन्नः, ततो मध्यतीव्रसंवेगस्यासन्नतरः, तस्मादधिमात्रतीव्रसंवेगस्याधिमात्रोपायस्याप्यासन्नतमः समाधिलाभः समधिफलं चेति ॥२२॥

 There is (the further division of) gentle-keen-intensity, middling-keen-intensity (and) extreme-keen-intensity. (These are) superior to the (other) three (adhimātropāyamrdusamvega &c.). Because of being superior to them (gain of samādhi and kaivalya) is near to the follower of gentle-keen-intensity, it is still nearer to the follower of middling-keen-intensity, and the gain of ‘samādhi' and the result of ‘samādhi' (kaivalya) is nearest to the follower of extreme means with extreme-keen-intensity.

 तेषामपि मृदुमध्यतीव्रोपक्रमतया विशिष्यमाणत्वात्ततो \[ऽपि\] विशेषः साधनानुष्ठानसंस्कारस्य।तद्विशेषादप्युत्तमस्य समाधिलाभः प्रत्यासीदतितराम्॥एतदस्य सूत्रस्य प्रयोजनम् – योगसाधनानुष्ठानं प्रति योगिनः कथमुपबृंहितोत्साहा भवेयुरिति।यथा लोके द्रुततरं सीमान्तं परि\[प्रति\] धावतामेतत्फलं भवतीति तद्वत्।अथवा—मन्दमन्देतरोपक्रमाणामपि योगिनामभिमतफलावाप्तिप्रकाशनादनवसन्नचे -तसः प्रवर्तेरन्निति।इतरथा तीव्रतरायासजनितभीतयोऽवसीदेयुरिति ॥२२॥

 Even amongst the ardent followers, due to the distinction of the progress being gentle, average and extreme there is tato 'pi visesah = this (further) distinction of the subliminal-impressions based on the practice of the means (of detachment and practice). "tadviśesādapi samādhilābhah" = the gain of samādhi is nearest to the best amongst them[^502].

[^502]: "The highest or the best is the yogi who is the follower of extreme means with extreme-keen-intensity."



 The purpose of this sūtra is to indicate how yogis can become greatly enthused towards the following of the various means to yoga[^503].' Similarly in the world, the one who runs the fastest towards the goal, gets the prize. Alternatively even those yogis who are progressing at a very slow rate can be enthused by lifting them up from their depression, by indicating that the desired goal is attainable. Otherwise, because of the anxiety which arises due to fatigue from extreme effort (the yogīs) may lose heart[^504].

[^503]: "'In Nyāya it is said that without knowing the result of an acti even a fool will not act. Thus, by indicating the various means and the end, the yogis can be greatly encou -raged to continue the practice of yoga."

[^504]: " The sūtra is thus of use to the yogis following different paths."

** किमेतस्मादेवासन्नतरः समाधिर्भवति।अथास्य लाभे भवत्यन्योऽपि कश्चिदुपायो न वेति—**

 Is (the attainment of) samādhi nearest only by this means ? Or is there any other means for its attainment or not

**ईश्वरप्रणिधानाद्वा ॥२३॥**

** **Or by devotion to īśvara (samādhi is gained).

 īśvara overcome by 'pranidhāna' which is a special kind of devotion, favours him, merely because of his (yogi's) deep desire (for samādhi).

 Because of his deep desire, the yogi comes very near to the attainment of samadhi and the result of samadhi.

 "kimetasmādevāsannataro bhavati? atha (tasya) asya lābhe . . . veti[^505] samādhi nearest only by this means ? Or is there any other means for its attainment or not? The Vivaranakāra has two readings ")".He mentions that there is another means ( to it ) ( through the sūtra ) īśvarapranidhānādvā. He will explain the meaning of the word Ïśvara [later](#);he explains the word praṇidhāna i.e., it is a special kind of devotion, "bhaktiviśesādāvarjita" (and) it makes īśvara face him and bless him, “tam” the yogī, who is a great bhakta, i.e., who is completely devoted to him “abhidhyānamātrena" = ( merely because of his deep desire for samādhi ).As he is the supreme Iśvara he blesses him (the yogi) without any effort and without any

[^505]: "The introduction to YS, I.23. Is (the attainment of



mental resolve[^506]. And by his blessing also "pratyāsannataraḥ samādhilābhaḥ phala -m ca iti[^507]2 = (there is the attainment of samādhi and its result also).

[^506]: "It is without any mental effort or will."

[^507]: " The Vivaraṇakāra does not strictly follow the available bhāṣya text here."

** अथ प्रधानपुरुषव्यतिरिक्तः कोऽयमीश्वरो नामेति ?**

 The question is asked — Now who is this so-called īśvara, different from ‘pradhāna' and 'purusa'?

**क्लेशकर्मविपाकाशयैरपरामृष्टः पुरुषविशेष ईश्वरः ॥२४॥**

 īśvara is a special purusa untouched by kleśa, karma, vipāka, and āśaya.

**** अविद्यादयः क्लेशाः, कुशलाकुशलानि कर्माणि, तत्फलं विपाकः, तदनुगुणा वासना आशयाः।ते च मनसि वर्तमानाः पुरुषे व्यपदिश्यन्ते, स हि तत्फलस्य भोक्तेति।यथा जयः पराजयो वा योद्धृषु वर्तमानः स्वामिनि व्यदिश्यते।यो ह्यनेन भोगेनापरामृष्टः स पुरुषविशेष ईश्वरः ।

 The afflictions are avidyā and the rest. The actions are good and evil (punya and pāpa). Their fruition is called (vipāka) ( jāti, āyus, bhogah). The deposits (of action) are the subliminal-impressions corresponding to these (the fruition).

 These existing in the mind, are attributed to puruṣa. He is said to be the experienc -er of their fruit, just as victory or defeat, though dependent on the soldiers, is attri -buted to their king. That special purusa, who is untouched by this (kind of) experience, is īśvara.

**** कैवल्यं प्राप्तस्तर्हि ? सन्ति च बहवः केवलिनः।

 ते हि त्रीणि बन्धनानिच्छित्त्वा कैवल्यं प्राप्ताः।ईश्वरस्य च तत्सम्बन्धो न भूतो न भावी।यथा मुक्तस्य पूर्वा बन्धकोटिः प्रज्ञायते नैवमीश्वरस्य।यथा वा प्रकृतिलीनस्योत्तरा बन्धकोटिः सम्भाव्यते नैवमीश्वरस्य।स तु सदैव मुक्तः सदैवेश्वर इति ।

 There are indeed many liberated souls who have attained liberation. They have attained liberation after breaking the three bondages. But the relation of Ïśvara with them (the three bondages) was never there in the past and will not be there in the future; thus the earlier bondage known (inferred) with reference to a liberated soul is not there with reference to Ïśvara, nor is the later bondage, which is possible with one absorbed in prakrti, there, with reference to īśvara. Whereas, he is at all times liber-ated, he is at all times īśvara.  
**** योऽसौ प्रकृष्टसत्त्वोपादानात् ईश्वरस्य शाश्वतिक उत्कर्षः, स किं सनिमित्तः ? आहोस्वित् निर्निमित्तः ? इति — तस्य शास्त्रं निमित्तम् ।

 शास्त्र पुनः किन्निमित्तम् ? प्रकृष्टसत्त्वनिमित्तम् ।  
 एतयोः शास्त्रोत्कर्षयोरीश्वरसत्त्वे वर्तमानयोरनादिः सम्बन्धः।एतस्मादेतद्भवति– सदैवेश्वरः सदैव मुक्त इति ।

 It might be asked-has this eternal excellence of īśvara, which is due to assuming



Samādhipādaḥ pure ‘sattva' any proof or is it without proof? The proof of that is the sacred texts. But it might again be asked — what proof have the sacred texts? (The reply is —) the proof of pure 'sattva' ( pure sattva is their proof).

 Between these two, the sacred texts and the excellence, there is a beginningless relationship because they reside in the pure 'sattva' of Isvara. From this it is true that He is at all times īśvara and at all times liberated.

 

तच्च तस्यैश्वर्यं साम्यातिशयविनिर्मुक्तम्।न तावदैश्वर्यान्तरेण तदतिशय्यते।यदेवातिशायि स्यात्तदेव तत्स्यात्।तस्माद्यत्र काष्ठाप्राप्तिरैश्वर्यस्य स ईश्वर इति।न च तत्समानमैश्वर्यमस्ति।कस्मात् ? द्वयोस्तुल्ययोरेकस्मिन् युगपत् कामितेऽर्थे नवमिदमस्तु पुराणमिदमस्तु इत्येकस्य सिद्धौ इतरस्य प्राकाम्यविघातादूनत्वं प्रसक्तम्।द्वयोश्च तुल्ययोर्युगपत् कामितार्थप्राप्तिर्नास्ति।अर्थस्य विरुद्धत्वात्।तस्मात् यस्य साम्यातिशयैर्विनिर्मुक्तमैश्वर्यं स एवेश्वरः।स च पुरुषविशेष इति ॥२४॥

 And this i.e., his (above-mentioned) pre-eminence is free from anything which equals it and anything which excels it. That is not excelled by another pre-eminence. Whatever pre-eminence seems to excel it that itself would be that (unexcelled pre- eminence). Therefore, where there is the uppermost limit of pre-eminence that is īśvara. Nor again is there a pre-eminence equal to his. Why not? When two equals simultaneously desire one thing one saying 'let this be new' and the other saying 'let this be old' if one wins, because the other's desire is thwarted, he becomes inferior. There cannot be the attainment of a desired object simultaneously by two equals, because that would be a contradiction of terms. Therefore, he who has pre-eminence which is free from an equal or superior pre-eminence, is that Iśvara. And He is a special purusa.

 ****अथ प्रधानपुरुषव्यतिरिक्तः कोऽयमीश्वर इति सांख्यशास्त्रे प्रसिद्ध्यभावादीश्वरसद्भावे चोपपत्तिमवश्यमनवगतेश्वरविशेषो वा पृच्छति।तत्र तावत् प्रतिजानीते– क्लेशकर्मविपाकाशयैरपरामृष्टः पुरुषविशेष ईश्वरः ॥

 “atha pradhānapurusavyatiriktah ko'yamīśvarah[^508]”. In the Sānkhya doctrine since Iśvara is not known, he says that (1) there is a necessity of proof for the existence of īśvara or (2) there should be mention of the special nature of this īśvara who is not known.He answers that (through the sutra) klesakarmavipākāśayairaparāmṛṣṭaḥ puruṣaviseșa īśvaraḥ.

[^508]: "The introduction to YS, I.24 i.e, who is this īśvara different from pradhāna and purusa."

 kleśa are the afflictions, avidyā, etc. They are called afflictions because they cause afflictions. “kuśalākuśalāni karmāni" = the actions which are done earlier are good and bad (evil). The word 'ca' stands for the one that remains[^509] and akuśala (bad deeds) we have kuśalākuśalāni which stand for both good and bad deeds. The whole word stands for a mixture of good and bad deeds. The fourth category of being neither good nor bad does not apply here. The word 'ca' is however not there in the available bhāṣya text."),i.e., "kuśalākuśalāni”  

[^509]: " In the deeds after kuśala (good deeds




 a mixture of both good and bad deeds. "tatphalam vipākah" = ( the result is) birth, span of life and nature of experience[^510]. These afflictions (and actions and fruition of action) stay till such time as liberation takes place[^511];therefore they-afflictions, actions and their results are called the deposits. Or the deposits of afflictions, actions and results are the collection of the afflictions.

[^510]: "Cf. YS, II.13."

[^511]: "Or till they are completely destroyed."

 ते मनसि वर्तमाना मनोवृत्तिप्रभवत्वात् पुरुषे व्यपदिश्यन्ते।कस्मात् ? स हि तत्फलस्य भोक्तेति।यथा राजनि जयपराजयौ योद्धृषु वर्तमानावपदिश्येते तत्फलं राजसंबन्धि इति ॥ या ह्यनेन भोगेनापरामृष्ट इति उच्यते।न कालविवक्षा, उपलक्षणार्थत्वं—न परामृश्यते, नापि परामृक्ष्यते, नापि परामृष्ट इति।केशकर्मविपाकाशयासंबन्धी (न्धयोगी ) त्यर्थः॥

 “te manasi vartamānāh puruse vyapadiśyante" = (These, existing in the mind) as they arise as mental modifications (are attributed to purusa). Why is this done? (The answer is) “sa hi tatphalasya bhokteti”;—just as victory or defeat, thoughdependent on the soldiers, is attributed to the king because the result relates to the king (so also the vṛttis are attributed to puruṣa). He is untouched by this experience there is no reference to time here[^512]³ as it is implied that he is not touched by it, nor will he be touched by it nor was he ever touched by it i.e., he is not related to afflictions, action, result of action and deposits of all these.।

[^512]: "Neither past, present nor future time is intended here."

 While clarifying the meaning of the sutra he states—"kaivalyam prāptastarhi santi bahavaḥ kevalinaḥ" = being untouched by afflictions can be possible for some particular time, and there are many who have been released — (now) are they all īśvaras? No; as there is scope for being touched (in the past) they are not absolutely untouched by afflictions, etc. In their case there is contact and loss of contact[^513].But īśvara means being always untouched (by afflictions). When the meaning of the word ‘untouched' is not determined one should not understand by implication its meaning as untouched at some time. Therefore he who is absolutely untouched (at all times), he alone is untouched.

[^513]: " They had this relationship with afflictions in the past and then they got rid of it. So they differ from İśvara."

 ते हि त्रीणि बन्धनानि प्राकृतवैकृतदाक्षिणानि सम्यग्दर्शनेन हित्वा कैवल्यं प्राप्ताः।ईश्वरस्य तु तत्संबन्धः क्लेशादिसंबन्धो न भूतो यथा मुक्तस्य वा बन्धकोटिर्मुक्तत्वोपपत्तेरेव ज्ञायते।बन्धपूर्विका हि मुक्तिः।नापि भावी।यथा प्रकृतिलीनस्य।तस्य ह्यनारब्धसंसारस्य उत्तरा बन्धकोटिः सम्भाव्यते।प्रवृत्तसंसारस्य चाप्रकृतिलीनचित्तस्य सा(समा)धिकारत्वात् पूर्वोत्तरबन्धकोटी संभवतः।तदिदं सर्वमत्रापरामृष्ट इति कालाविवक्षाप्रदर्शनार्थम्।स तु सदैव मुक्तः सदैवेश्वरः ॥



 The three bondages are prākṛtika, vaikārika and [dākṣinādi'](#) and they (the liberated souls after breaking them) through right knowledge, have attained liberation. But in the case of īśvara the connection with the afflictions was “na bhūto . . . . jñāyate[^514]”never there in the past as in the case of the liberated soul, whose bondage is understood by the very term of being liberated. Liberation is indeed preceded by bondage[^515].Nor (will Ïśvara) have (connection with afflictions) in the future as in the case of one absorbed in prakṛti.[^516] In his case the future bondage of samsāra which has not come into operation will come into being. In one who is involved in the world and whose mind is not absorbed in prakṛti there is the potency to give rise to effects[^517] and so it has both the earlier and later bondages. All this is mentioned in this context in order to indicate that 'untouched' has no reference to time whatsoever. He is at all times liberated, he is at all times Ïśvara.

[^514]: "The bhāṣya has prajñāyate whereas the Vivaraṇakāra uses jñāyate."

[^515]: "Liberation from a previous state of bondage to a free state is what is meant by the term mukta or mukti."

[^516]: "*Cf. YS, I. 19."

[^517]: "sādhikara is the mind with its samskāras of good and evil, capable of giving rise to a round of births and deaths."

 तत्र पुरुषविशेष ईश्वर इत्युक्तत्वात्, ईश्वरस्य पुरुषस्यानैश्वर्यधर्मत्वात्, चित्तस्य चैश्वर्यधर्मत्वात्, निरतिशयैश्वर्यस्य च प्रकृष्टचित्तसंबन्धापेक्षत्वात् प्राप्तमेवोत्तरार्थमनुवदति—योऽसौ प्रकृष्टसत्त्वोपादानादीश्वरस्य शाश्वतिक उत्कर्ष इति। नित्यनिरतिशयसर्वज्ञानैश्वर्यशक्तिसम्पत्तिरुत्कर्षः ॥

 In that context, since it is mentioned that Iśvara is a special puruṣa, it means that the puruṣa called īśvara (not the special puruṣa) has the quality of powerlessness (or has no quality of power) and the mind has the quality of power. In the case of power which is unequalled there is need of connection with a perfect mind; thus the meaning which is arrived at in this way is repeated (by Vyāsa) (through the wor -ds) "yo' sau prakṛṣṭa ... utkarṣa" and so on.[^518]

 Excellence is the possession of the powers of omniscience and omnipotence which is eternal and which is unexcelled.

[^518]: "The meaning of connection with a perfect mind which was logically derived is now being stated by Vyāsa. Puruṣa cannot have connection with aiśvarya as it is a qua -lity and belongs to the mind. And īśvara is connected with unequalled aiśvarya through a perfect mind."

 तत्र प्रतिज्ञाविशुद्धयर्थं प्रश्नपूर्वमुपक्रमतेस किं सनिमित्त आहोस्विन्निर्निमित्त इति।निमित्तशब्दः कारणपर्यायः। स किं सकारण आहोस्विन्निष्कारण इति।किञ्चातः ? यदि तावत् सकारणस्तदा सदैवेश्वर इत्ययुक्तम्, अनित्यत्वात्।अथ निष्कारणः, तथा चोत्कर्षस्य कार्यत्वादसत्त्वप्रसङ्गः।न हि निष्कारणं कार्यं दृश्यते लोके ॥

In order to clearly state the conclusion he begins the statement with the question-



eternal excellence of īśvara which is due to assuming pure sattva) any cause or is it without any cause? What is the purpose of this question?

 Objection—If it has a cause then the statement that he is at all times īśvara is not correct as it would not be eternal[^519].' If then it is uncaused then since excellence is an effect it cannot come into existence at all, as one does not see an effect without a cause in the world.

[^519]: "Something which is caused cannot be eternal."

 Answer—Here it is said-it is not without a cause as the scriptures are its cause.Scripture here means knowledge; scripture ( knowledge ) is the cause. Since omniscience is eternal it is based on something distant and hidden from the means which accomplish something based on the nature of material things.

 यद्येवं ज्ञानस्यान्यतोऽधिगमपूर्वत्वात्प्रागनुत्कर्षः प्राप्त इत्यत आह-शास्त्रं पुनः किन्निमित्तमिति।यदि स्वाभाविकं ज्ञानं, मत्तोन्मत्तज्ञानवदनुत्कर्षहेतुत्वम्।अथ पुनः सनिमित्तकं, निमित्तात् प्रागनुत्कर्ष इति मन्यते ॥ न तावन्निर्निमित्तम्।यतः प्रकृष्टसत्त्वनिमित्तं प्रकृष्टसत्त्वाश्रयमिति यावत्।अत एव स्वभावज्ञानदोषाभावः ॥

 Objection—If that is so, then since knowledge is to be obtained from some other source it is not perfect initially. Thus he says — what is the cause of scripture (knowledge)? If scriptural knowledge is a spontaneous (natural) occurrence then it can be caused by non-excellence as in the case of knowledge of a man who is drunk or mad.Moreover if it has a cause then before the functioning of the cause it would have been imperfect.

 Answer —But it is not causeless, as it “ prakrstasattvanimittam” = rests on pure sattva. That is why it is free from the defects of knowledge which occurs naturally[^476].

[^476]: " "

 किञ्च-स्वाभाविकज्ञानत्वेऽपि न मत्तादिज्ञानवदपकर्षहेतुत्वम्।नित्यमुक्तक्लेशादिसत्त्वाश्रयत्त्वात्।तत्र यथैव ज्ञानसंस्कारस्मृतिप्रबन्धानामन्योन्यनिमित्तनैमित्तिकभावेन बीजाङ्कुरवदनादिसंबन्धः, तथैव शास्त्रप्रकर्षयोरीश्वरचेतसि नित्यप्रवृत्तप्रबन्धरूपेण प्रवर्तमानयोरनाद्यन्तः संबन्धः।तत्रोत्कर्षो ज्ञानस्य कार्यमेव।ज्ञानमपि तस्य कारणमेव ॥

 Moreover, even when knowledge is taken as occurring spontaneously it is not the cause of any degradation as in the case of knowledge of a man drunk and so on, since it rests on sattva and is eternally free from the afflictions.

 Just as there is beginningless relationship between the sprout and its seed so also there is the relationship of cause and effect between knowledge, subliminal-impressions and memory which are (all) mutually related; similarly in the mind of īśvara there is a beginningless and endless relation between scripture and excellence, a relation which is eternally active. There excellence is an effect of scriptural knowledge alone; in other words scriptural knowledge is its cause.[^521]

 अन्येषां व्याख्यानम् – निमित्तशब्दः प्रमाणवाची।तस्य शास्त्रं निमित्तं प्रमाणम्,तेन हि तदुत्कर्षः प्रमीयते।शास्त्रं पुनः किंप्रमाणकम् ?ईश्वरनिर्मलसत्त्वप्रमाणम्।विशुद्धसत्त्वप्रणीतत्वाद्धि शास्त्रस्य प्रामाण्यम्,यथा मन्वादीनाम्।तथा च श्रुतिः– 'यकिंचिन्मनुरभ्यवदत्तद्भेषजम्' इति।यथा च लोके गुरुणाऽभिहितमिति ॥

[^521]: "Excellence and scriptural knowledge are related as effect and cause."




Others[^522]explain the word "nimitta" to mean proof i.e., the proof of that (excellence) is the scripture and it is through that, that his excellence is inferred. But it can again be asked ‘what proof has the scripture ? The proof is the pure-sattva of īśvara. The authority of the scripture is because it was composed out of the pure-sattva as in the case of Manu and others. Thus there is the following scriptural statement 'whatever is said by Manu is medicine' ( a cure )[^523].

[^522]: "In fact Vācaspati Miśra and Vijñānabhikṣu take the word nimitta to mean proof. Does this mean that the Vivaraṇakāra is later than Miśra if not later than both? Or were there other commentators, earlier to all of these, and from whom the Vivaraṇakāra differed but with whom Miśra and Bhikṣu agreed. This is less likely. In that case Miśra and Bhik -ṣu would have mentioned the variant explanation. This is also significant in the context of the question of the authorship of the Vivaraṇa."

[^523]: " Taitt. Sam, 2.2, 10.2."

 Thus in the world whatever is said by a guru ( is proof of truth).

 एतयोः शास्त्रोत्कर्षयोः प्रमाणप्रमेयतया निराद्यन्तः सम्बन्धः ॥

 ननु च नैवेश्वरसत्त्वे\[अ\] वर्तमानेन शास्त्रेण तदुत्कर्षः प्रमीयते।नैष दोषः।तत्प्रभवत्वात्तत्र वर्तमानम्।वर्त(मान)त एव तत्प्रभवमपि शास्त्रं तस्मिन् सर्वज्ञत्वादेव।लोकेऽपि यतो यत्प्रभवति वर्तते तत्तस्मिन्, यथा तन्त्वादिषु पटादि।तत्प्रभवत्वमनुमानागमाभ्यामवगम्यते।शास्त्रप्रमाणकः उत्कर्षः,ईश्वरप्रमाणकं शास्त्रमिति भिन्नाश्रयत्वाच्छास्त्रोत्कर्षयोर्नेतरेतराश्रयत्वम् ॥

 There is a beginningless and endless relationship between scripture and excelle -nce due to being the proof and the proved.

 Objection—But then, through the scripture which at present is not existent in the sattva of īśvara, his excellence is inferred[^524].

[^524]: " The scripture is seen in the world and not in the sattva of Ïśvara."

 Answer—There is no defect in this. As it arises there it ( still) exists therein. Even though the scriptures arose from it[^525], it continues to exist in it as it is omniscient. In the world as well, that which arises from something (still) exists in that, as for instance cloth, etc., which exists in the threads, etc. Its origin is known through inference and through the scriptures[^526]. Excellence has the scripture as its proof and the scripture has īśvara as its proof; thus having different supports, both the scripture and the (sattva) excellence of Ïśvara do not have the defect of mutual dependence (on each other for their proof).

[^525]: " From the pure-sattva of īśvara."

[^526]: " The origin of the scriptures from the pure-sattva of Īśvara is known from these two sources."

 ननु च शास्त्रादीश्वरप्रामाण्यं, तत्प्रामाण्याच्च शास्त्रप्रामाण्यमिति स्यादन्योन्याश्रयत्वम् – उच्यते- ईश्वरप्रामाण्यस्यानुमानेन सिद्धत्वाददोषः ॥

 Objection—But then, there is mutual dependence when you say that the proof of Isvara is the scripture and the proof of scripture is the authority of Isvara.

 Answer—As the authority of Iśvara is established through inference there is no such defect.




"etasmādetadbhavati"[^527] (From this it is true that He is at all times īśvara and at all times liberated).

[^527]: "Thus it is proved that īśvara is always free, etc. VBh., under this sūtra."

 Question—How is this possible?

 Answer—The eternal relationship in the form of cause and effect between unsurpassed knowledge and perfection which have as support Īśvara and pure-sattva, is permanent. Therefore "sa tu sadaiva muktaḥ sadaiveśvarah[^528]"= he is at all times liberated and at all times Īśvara. Thus it is said here that the result of the proof given will be mentioned as "tacca tasyaiśvaryam sāmyātiśayavimuktam" = his pre-emi -nence is free from anything which equals it and anything which excels it. Or this, in short, is the meaning of the sutra.

[^528]: " The order of the text in the bhāṣya is changed in the Vivaraṇa."

 अतिशयविमुक्ततां व्याचष्टे – न तावदैश्वर्यान्तरेण तदतिशय्यते । कुतः ? यदेवैश्वर्यान्तरं तदतिशयानं मन्यसे तदेव तत् ऐश्वर्यं मयाऽभिहितम् । यत्रैवैश्वर्यान्तरातिशायि भवत्यैश्वर्यं स एवेश्वर इति यावत् । न च तत्समानमैश्वर्यमस्ति । समानधर्मप्रकर्षासंभवात् ॥

 He now explains how he (Iśvara) is unsurpassed (in power) (through the words)"na tāvadaiśvaryāntareṇa tadatiśayyate". Why is it so? Whatever other power you would think excels it, that power itself is what is being described by me. This is so because whatever other power there is which excels it, that is itself īśvara.

 "na ca samānamaiśvaryamasti"[^529]= as it is not possible to have excellence (perfection) as a common property.[^530]

[^529]: "He now discusses the next question of somebody equalling Ïśvara's power."

 ने ह्येकस्मिन् राज्ये द्वयोः संभवो राज्ञोः । एकस्य वा द्वे राज्ये । तथा प्रतिपादयति— तद्द्वयोस्तुल्यत्वं प्रसक्तम्। न ह्येकस्यान्यतरत्र प्राकाम्यमबाधित्वा अन्यतरस्मिन् प्रवृत्तिरुपपद्यते । द्वयोश्च युगपदेकार्थयोरेकस्य प्राकाम्येण प्रवृत्तिरेव नास्ति। प्रकामिते वस्तुनि समानप्रकर्षस्यार्थस्य विरुद्धत्वात्। येन चं समानप्रकर्षता तस्य तेनैव स बाध्यते। (ते च) तच्च न वाचा बाधनमितरस्य रूपातिशया आवृत्त्यतिरायाश्च विरुध्यन्ते । सामान्यानि त्वतिशयैः सह वर्तन्त इति वक्ष्यामः॥

[^530]: "  Perfection cannot be equalled-there can be only one entity which can be perfect."

 तस्माद्यस्य साम्यातिशयविप्रोषितमैश्वर्यं स ईश्वर इति प्रधानपुरुषव्यतिरिक्तः पुरुषविशेष ईश्वरः सिद्धः ॥२४॥

 It is not possible to have two kings in one kingdom nor can one king have two kingdoms. Thus he says "dvayoḥ ... prasaktam" =the equality of both will be endangered. It will not be possible to fulfil the desire of one without thwarting the desire of the other[^531]. When two equals simultaneously desire the same thing then by the desire of one there can be no activity, as there will be a clash for the object between two equals if both desire it. That which is its equal is its own opposition (is opposed by it)."[^532]

[^531]: " The one whose desire is not fulfilled becomes inferior. And logically there cannot be two perfect purusas."

[][^532] This opposition is not through words; the opposition is between superiority in form and an inward superiority-we are saying that equals exist along with their (relative) superiorities[^534]. Thus he whose power is both unequalled and unsurpassed he is īśvara who is different from both pradhāna and puruṣa-thus īśvara is established.

[^532]: "Thus there cannot be two equals."

[^534]: " The point is thus being made that there cannot be two equals logically."



**तत्र निरतिशयं सर्वज्ञबीजम् ॥२५॥**

 In Him there is unexcelled the germ of Omniscience or-In Him there is unexcelled Omniscience.

 किञ्च–यदिदमतीतानागतप्रत्युत्पन्नप्रत्येकसमुच्चयातीन्द्रियग्रहणमल्पं बह्विति सर्वज्ञबीजमेतद्विवर्धमानं यत्र निरतिशयं स सर्वज्ञः । अस्ति काष्ठाप्राप्तिः सर्वज्ञबीजस्य, सातिशयत्वात्, परिमाणवत् इति । यत्र काष्ठाप्राप्तिर्ज्ञानस्य स सर्वज्ञः । स च पुरुषविशेष इति ॥

 This process of knowing subtle (objects) either singly or collectively, whether in the past, future or present, either small or great, is the germ of omniscience;He in whom this (excellence), growing progressively, is unexcelled, He is the Omniscient.

 There is the attainment of the uppermost limit of the germ of omniscience, becaus -e it admits of degrees of excellence, as in the case of any ascending scale. He in whom there is the attainment of the uppermost limit of knowledge, He is omniscient; and He is a special puruṣa. (If the objection is raised that by this argument the omniscience of Buddha, Jina and such others is proved the reply is as follows.) An inference exhausts itself in reaching a general conclusion and is not competent to perceive a particular instance. The special knowledge of His name and such things are to be sought from the sacred texts.

 Though there is an absence of self-gratification in Him, kindness towards living beings is the purpose (of creation). It may be imagined that Puruşa conceives thus—During the periodic dissolution and during the great dissolution 'through the instru ction of knowledge and dharma I shall uplift the puruṣas roaming in the world.'

 Thus it is said (by Pañcaśikhācārya) ‘Having assumed a created mind through compassion, the First Knower, the Worshipful one, the Supreme Sage, declared this doctrine to āsuri who desired to know (it).'

 यथाप्रतिज्ञातस्येश्चरस्य सिद्धौ प्रमाणमुपन्यस्यते—तत्र निरतिशयं सर्वज्ञबीजम्।तत्र तस्मिन् यथाप्रतिज्ञातलक्षण ईश्वरे निरतिशयं भवितुमर्हति । किं तदिति ? यदिदम् अव्यभिचारि प्रत्यक्षानुमानज्ञानम्

 He now cites proof for the establishment of puruṣa which has been described (through the sūtra) tatra niratisayam sarvajñābijam-tatra = in that īśvara whose qualities have been described[^535]' they can only be unexcelled.[^536]What is that (which is unexcelled?) “yadidam" = this uncontradicted knowledge based on direct perception and inference[^537]which is of the past, the future, the present or collectively in the past, etc.[^538],is an object beyond the range of the senses. As both the past and future are

[^535]: "In sūtra I.24 and in the bhāsya under it."

[^536]: "The qualities cannot be equalled or surpassed as has been already pointed out."

[^537]: " It is strange that inference is mentioned in the case of īśvara."

[^538]: "An object known in all the three states simultaneously."



beyond the range of the senses it is mentioned as "atīndriyagrahaṇam."

 ' तच्चातीन्द्रियग्रहणं त्रिविधम्-सूक्ष्मविषयं व्यवहितविषयं विप्रकृष्टविषयञ्च।अल्पं बह्विति। यथाप्रसिद्ध -मेतद्विवर्धमानं सातिशयत्वेन सर्वज्ञबीजं यथा धूमविज्ञानमग्निविज्ञानस्य।कथम् ? यत्र प्रकर्षकाष्ठां प्रतिपद्यते। ज्ञानस्य ज्ञात्राश्रयत्वात् यत्रेति ज्ञातोच्यते - यस्मिन् ज्ञातरीति।स सर्वज्ञः सिद्धः ॥

 And that grasp which is beyond the range of the senses is threefold. i.e., that which is subtle, which is hidden and which is distant. "alpam bahviti sarvajñabījametad vi-vardhamānam" = that which is well-known[^539],' growing progressively in terms ofexcellence (results in omniscience), as the knowledge of smoke results in the knowledge of fire. How is this so? That is perfection wherein the limit of excellence is reached. As knowledge is dependent on a knower the word “yatra" ( in the bhāsya) denotes the knower i.e., in that knower. Thus it is established that he is omniscient.

[^539]: "As small and big — these terms are well-known in the world."

 तथा शक्तिरपि सातिशयत्वेन विवर्धमाना यत्र काष्ठां प्राप्नोति, स सर्वशक्तिः।तेन जगन्निर्माणस्थापनो-पसंहारादिकर्तृत्वसिद्धिः।तथैश्वर्यस्यापि वर्धमानस्य यत्र काष्ठाप्राप्तिः स परमेश्वरः।ततश्च अशक्त्यादिविपर्ययदोषाभावसिद्धिः ॥

 Similarly in the case of power also, that which grows progressively and reaches the limit of power is omnipotent (omnipotence). And through that it is established that there is an agent who creates, maintains and destroys the world. Similarly, in case of power also, he in whom it reaches its limit (of perfection) is Parameśvara. And from that (perfection) there is absence of defects of opposites like lack of power, etc.

 अथापि स्यात् – अज्ञानस्यापि विवर्धमानस्य स्वभावसिद्धस्य काष्ठाप्राप्तस्य तस्मिन्नीश्वरे सिद्धिरिति–न – ज्ञानविरोधात्।न हि ज्ञानाज्ञानयोर्विरुद्धयोरेकस्मिन्नभिसंयोगोऽस्ति।न हि ज्ञाने प्रकर्षवति तत्राज्ञानं संभवति ॥ यत्र हि ज्योतिर्विवर्धते तत्र तमोऽपकृष्यत एव।विपर्ययोऽपीति चेत्-तच्च न–सति ज्योतिषितमसोऽनुपलम्भात्।विद्यमानं हि तमो ज्योतिषा तिरस्क्रियते, न कदाचिद्विद्यमानं ज्योतिस्तमसा ऽभिभूयते ॥

 Objection — But then, ignorance, which is natural, also growing progressively will reach its limit and it can have its perfection in that Iśvara.

 Answer —That cannot be, because it is opposed to knowledge. There cannot be the existence (close contact) in one person of two opposites like knowledge and ignorance. Where knowledge is pre-eminent there cannot be ignorance. Where light increases there darkness only decreases.

 Objection — It is said that the opposite can also be true.

 Answer—It is not so. When there is light, darkness is not there. ( It is also seen that) when there is darkness it is removed by light and when there is light it is never overpowered by darkness.

 यदपि जलधरोपरोधात् प्रावृषि रवेरदर्शनम्, तदपि दृष्टिव्यवधानमात्रम्।न पुनः प्रकाश एव तिरोधीयते तमोवत्।तस्मान्न, यत्र ज्ञानविवृद्धिस्तत्राज्ञानस्य भावः सवितरीव तमसः।नित्यात्यन्ततिरोहितरजस्तमोगुणसत्त्वोपादानात् ॥



 किञ्च–नाज्ञानस्यावस्तुविषयत्वाद्विवृद्धिः संभवति । ज्ञानस्य ज्ञेयवस्तुविषयत्वादभिवृद्ध्युपपत्तिः । अज्ञानस्य हि वस्तुविषयत्वे ज्ञानत्वप्राप्तिः ॥

 Even in the rainy season when the sun is not visible due to obstruction by clouds, that is also a case of the sight being covered. It is not as if the light itself has disappeared as in the case of darkness[^540]. Therefore, where there is increase of knowledge there cannot be the existence of ignorance; it is like darkness in the presence of the sun. (Moreover) knowledge has as its cause sattva which comes into being when both the gunas, rajas and tamas, have eternally and absolutely disappeared.[^541]

[^540]: "Darkness disappears in the presence of light but here light is only covered from sight, it has not disappeared."

 Moreover, since ignorance has no real thing as its object there can be no growth in it (ignorance). Since knowledge has a real known object, it is proper that there is growth in it. And when ignorance has a real thing as object it becomes knowledge.

[^541]: "Even ordinary knowledge is due to the sattva-guṇa being predominant and both rajas and tamas being overpowered. In the case of perfect knowledge, both rajas and tamas must be totally and eternally overpowered."

 यश्चापि स्थावरादिष्वज्ञानप्रकर्ष इति, नासौ प्रकर्षः । अत्यन्तज्ञानाभावापेक्षया हि स उच्यते। अज्ञानस्य प्रकर्षे हि सत्यज्ञानसहस्रस्य न ज्ञानेनैकेन बाधः स्यात् । तथा \[दा \] हि प्रत्यज्ञानं ज्ञानेनोत्पन्नेनानेकेन बाधनं स्यात् । तस्मान्नाज्ञानस्य प्रकर्षः स्वरूपेण ॥

 The perfection of ignorance in inanimate things is not really perfection. It is said (only) with reference to the total absence of knowledge. If there was perfection in ignorance then a thousand ignorances cannot be removed (opposed) by a single knowledge. But towards that (kind of) ignorance there should be its removal by the rise of many knowledges[^542].Therefore in truth there is no perfection of ignorance.

[^542]: "But in the world it is seen that the ignorance of many people is removed by one knowledge itself."

 यस्य हि सातिशयत्वं तस्य काष्ठाप्राप्तिर्दृश्यते । यथा फलादिपरिमाणानामाकाशपर्यन्तता । तथा सर्वज्ञबीजमपि परां काष्ठां प्राप्तुमर्हति ॥

 It is seen that whatever has the property to increase reaches its uppermost limit. This is like the size of fruits, etc., which reaches its limit in the expanse of space[^543]. Similarly, the seed of omniscience also can reach its highest limit.

[^543]: "The ascending scale in the measurement of size can only end in the vastness of space, in infinite space."

 All things both collectively and individually, is the direct perception of one since they are knowables like pots, etc.

 It is the goal of puruṣa as it has knowledge as object, as in the case of knowables like pots, etc.



 The earth is something produced as it has parts, as in the case of pots, etc.

 The world has been completed by one who knows the living beings, their actions,the means of action and the fruit (of action) separately, as it ( the world) has the speciality of being the place for their experience[^544]. It is like (building) a lofty mansion(palace etc.)[^545].The earth has been made by one who knows the experiences of many living beings, as it has things to be experienced by many living beings, like rice and barley.

[^544]: "'The style is somewhat tedious and cumbersome when compared to similar arguments in the Brahmasūtrabhāṣya of Sankara."

[^545]: "²A person who builds a big mansion already knows the purpose it will be used for. The argument being that there has to be an intelligent Iśvara to do this."

 The earth has been made by one for the sake of use of many (living things) as in the case of a house, etc. The (earth with its) collection of mountains and rivers which supports all living things, is made by a single maker who knows what is fit for the experiences of those inhabiting it.

 The sun has been created by one who knows the capacity of its light, etc., which many living beings share, as he is himself of the essence of light, like a lamp and so on.

 The movement of the sun with its fixed timings of sunrise and sunset is enjoined by one who knows its purpose as it has fixed timings as in the case of agricultural activities. The movement of the sun, planets, moon and stars is enjoined by the one intelligent Ïśvara as they have fixed timings and it is difficult to (maintain the) movement (without Iśvara's help); this is like the actions of disciples and servants who know the rules of [conduct](#).

 The waxing and waning of the moon is enjoined by one who has the knowledge of dates, time, etc., as there is the (correct) division of time as in the case of a waterwheel.[^476]5 The moon has been made by one who knows the divisions of time as it is  

[^476]: " "




connected with increase (waxing) and decrease (waning), as in the case of a water wheel (made by man).

 The world has one master who is intelligent. This is so because it is like a kingdom which has different groups of living beings mutually opposing and coming together, having their own leaders but over all of whom there is the one king.

 अग्निहोत्रादिसाधनसाधनीये कस्यचित्प्रत्यक्षे, साध्यसाधनरूपत्वात्, भुजितृप्तिवत् ॥

 This whole world with its operations based on means and ends, is directly perceived by One; it is like a war wherein the purpose of intermittent opposition and peace is only one[^547]. This is so because it is a collection of so many things like the case of a potter, etc., making (his pots)[^476] This is the conclusion.

[^476]: " "

[^547]: "'The simile of war where victory is the only motive of the one who conducts the war, again jars in this context."

 Everything is simultaneously perceived by the One; even when there are many things there is mutual relationship and it is well-known that relationships have many uses. When something is to be achieved through the agnihotra sacrifice in the direct vision (guidance) of someone (a priest), it has the same form like achieving an end through some means; it is similar to satisfying one's hunger by eating.

 सर्वाः शक्तयः कस्यचित् प्रत्यक्षाः, वस्तुत्वात्, घटादिवत् ॥

 अप्रतिबन्धेन कस्यचित् प्रत्यक्षोपलभ्यं सर्वम्, अनेक (सत्वे) त्वे सत्यन्योन्यसंबन्धात् नाट्यसंबन्धिनर्तकादिवत् ॥

 All powers are directly perceived (known) by someone as they have some object (towards which they are directed) like a pot and so on. If there is no obstacle in bet -ween, then all things collectively are directly perceived continuously by someone because they are related through having qualities like sound and so on. It is like sounds, etc., which are heard when someone is eating a lengthened cake[^549].In itself everything is known directly by some one person as it is in essence knowable; it is like the things used in a drama.

[^549]: " 3This again strikes one as an un-Sankara simile."

 Everything is directly perceived by someone without any obstruction, as when there are many things there is a mutual relationship between them; it is like actors who are connected (mutually) through the play.

 संसाररहितः सर्वज्ञः, अज्ञानाभावात्, मुक्तात्मवत् । क्लेशादिरहित ईश्वरः, अप्रतिबन्धज्ञानत्वात्, सिद्धयोगिवत् ॥



 एतेन क्लेशादिप्रतिबन्धाज्ञानरहितत्वेन चक्षुरादीन्द्रियग्रामनिरपेक्षसर्वविषयज्ञानत्वं सिद्धम्। सर्वार्थग्रहण—समर्थस्य परमेश्वरचित्तस्य सर्वव्यापिनो युगपत्सर्वविषययोगित्वात् । एवं सति समस्तवस्तुग्रहणाभावे कारणाभा(वानु)वोपपतिः ॥

 īśvara is free from samsāra, he is omniscient as he is free from ignorance; thus he is like a liberated ātman[^550].Ïśvara is free from afflictions as he has unobstructed kno -wledge; thus he is like a yogi who has this [siddhi.](#)

[^550]: "'In this respect of being free from ignorance."

 Due to this freedom from ignorance which is an obstruction to the afflictions, it is established that there is knowledge of all things independent of the operation of the sense-organs like the eyes, etc. The mind of the omnipresent Parameśvara, which is capable of grasping all objects, has the inherent capacity to grasp all objects at once (simultaneously). When this is so, there is no reason why there should be the absence of perceiving all objects (at once) (by īśvara).

नापि मूर्तिमत्प्रतिबन्धोऽप्याकाशवदेव सर्वविषययोगिनोऽपि चित्तस्य।विषयानवस्थानादाविर्भावतिरो-भावस्मृतिसंकल्पानवस्थितत्वोपपत्तिः। विषयाकारतया वृत्तिलाभादर्कप्रभावत्॥ न हि क्लेशाद्यावरणावच्छत्रं चित्तसत्त्वम्, तस्याधर्मादियोगात् । सर्वगतस्य सर्वार्थस्यापिसत्त्वस्याधर्मादिप्रतिबन्धकनिरुद्धस्वकीयप्रवृत्तिमार्गत्वादिन्द्रियादिद्वारापेक्षित्वमुपपद्यते । यथा अपवरकाद्यावरणावृतः प्रदीपस्तदावरणगतच्छिद्रद्वारेण बहिः प्रकाशयति । स एव तु प्रदीपः प्रभिन्नापवरकावरणः सन्ननपेक्ष्य तत्तच्छिद्रमार्गंसमन्ततः प्रकाशयति ॥

 Moreover, there can be no material obstruction to the mind (of īśvara) which, like space, is connected to all objects. There is no end to objects and there are endless appearances, disappearances, memory (of them) and decisions (regarding them); like the light of the sun, there is modification (of the mind of Ïśvara) into the for -ms of the (infinite objects).

 Moreover, the sattva-mind (of īśvara ) is not obstructed by the covering of afflictions etc[^551].,since they (afflictions) are connected with [adharma](#).

[^551]: "kleśa, karma, vipāka."

 The sattva-mind (of ordinary people), though able to perceive all things and be present everywhere, is dependent on the instrument of the senses which channelise its operations because it is restricted by obstacles like adharma, etc. When a lamp is hidden by a covering (having many) holes, it illuminates the outside (objects) through those [holes](#). And that same lamp, when the covering of holes is broken, illuminates everything around it without depending on the holes.

तथैवेश्वरसत्त्वं क्लेशाद्यावरणयोगाभावादसति विषयविशेषनिरोधिकारणे युगपदशेषार्थग्रहणम्। ततश्च स्वातिलङ्घनानतिलङ्घनादिदोषाभावः ॥

 Similarly, the sattva of Īśvara, in the absence of connection with the covering of afflictions, etc., has no obstructive cause with reference to (perception of) any particular object and so has knowledge of all objects at the same time. And so, in him,there is absence of the defect of crossing or not crossing his own limits.

 Since everything is the object (of Īśvara) the entire world must have (only) one Ïśvara (who perceives all) as there are many things which are in need of a protector, as is well-known in the case of a kingdom[^552].'  

[^552]: "1.It is strange to find the repetition of the same argument again which is not adding any new dimension to the discussion."


 There are many instruments (methods) for the sake of ruling the kingdom firmly; there are many countries having powerful strongholds (forts) capable of defeating each other[^553];one has to pierce bodies which have been arranged in an unbreakable (imperishable) manner; (thus) it is acknowledged to be a kingdom of that kind[^554].

[^553]: "2.In becoming the king these various things have to be done."

[^554]: " 3.The style is extremely vague and seems to be deliberately confusing. The construc -tion is laboured and this is not the typical style of Sankarācārya."

 The duties of the various castes and of the different stages is life have been taught by the learned who know the various connections between the agent of action, the experiencer, action itself and its means and results; these are to be followed by those desiring (specific) results and by those afraid of committing sins; this is like the practice of medicine and so on, for curing (diseases).[^555]

 Similarly, those teachings are meant for others, they are in the form of advice, they are believed (to be correct) by learned people and they deal with such matter which the ordinary people cannot know without being instructed; thus it is like the teaching of remedies for cure (of diseases)[^556].

[^555]: " 4.Teachings of the wise regarding duties mentioned earlier."

[^556]: "5.The tendency to repeat the same simile and argument is again visible here."

 The body and the sense-organs have been made only for the sake of a single purpose by one who knows the purpose of them all, as it has the means of maintaining the determined actions[^557]; it is like the wooden machinery of a huge mansion[^558]." Similar

[^557]: "  6.The body and senses are so fashioned as to accomplish the actions determined by the previous karma; thus only one who knows all that, can bring about the body and senses of each person in order toaccomplish that purpose."

[^558]: " 7.The analogy is not clear. Probably it refers to some machinery which is able to fashion the entire palace according to a determined plan."



to it, it has the purpose of constructing it (the mansion) according to a determined. plan.

 तथा सर्वं, कार्यनियतोपादानत्वात्, भोकार्थत्वात्, भोगसाधनत्वाच्च, घटादिवत् । उत्पत्तिमत्त्वेऽप्येते हेतवः ॥

 Thus the sense-organs are the instruments (for action) like a carpenter's chisel fashioning the axe. Thus everything has determined (fixed) effects[^559],' serve the purpose of the experiencer and are the means for experience, as in the case of pots and so on. These are the reasons even for their coming into being.

[^559]: "1.This almost argues for determinism which is not quite like Śankara, the Brahmasūtra-bhāṣyakāra."

 Thus the earth is perishable being of middling dimension[^560], having the capacity for being destroyed by many causes, being the support for experience, having the forms which are the means for bringing about the results of actions, having many regions which are (in some places ) high, ( in some places) low, (in some places) filled up, (in some places) reduced, burnt and split ( in some places).

[^560]: "2.There are three kinds of measures i.e., aṇu which is atomic, madhya which is iddling and vibhu which is all-pervading."

 The gross elements like earth, etc., are perishable like the bodies, since they have the power of mutual destruction as in the case of men possessing weapons.

 Then there is its opposite, space, which has the properties of creation and destruction[^561], which is different from puruṣa[^562], which is directly the instrument as it supports objects like pots, etc., which have the quality of being able to be grasped by the external senses.

[^561]: "³It is not now known which school believed in space as the creator or destroyer of things."

[^562]: " 4.Puruşa presumably is being used in the sense of man here. Perhaps some other word like manusya, would have served the purpose better."

 Thus it is established that Parameśvara is one in whom there is unexcelled power, knowledge, and supremacy.[^563]

[^563]: "5.How this conclusion is drawn from the argument from space is not clear."

 Objection—It is said here, that the meaning of the word Ïśvara is not one who is omniscient, as



1\. it is in essence dealing with objects which can be known through being denoted by words, and

2\. depends on instruments ( like the senses) to know them as in the case of us, (human beings).

 Moreover, the word Ïśvara cannot denote one connected with unexcelled knowledge as it is (only) a word like the word pot, etc[^564].'

[^564]: "'The word in itself cannot have this sense according to the opponent."

 The world has no all-knowing īśvara of all, as it has many ( independent) beings depending on each other and is like a kingdom having many rulers, opposed to each other.

 All living beings do not experience omniscience with reference to the past and future time also like in the present[^565]since they are living beings like us. The omniscient, all-powerful īśvara, imagined by the disputant, does not exist, as there is no one like that; it is like the horn of a rabbit. Therefore, he is neither omniscient nor all-powerful as he has nobody like a liberated ätman (self). And if he has a body then the body being dependent on dharma, etc[^566].,there will be connection with the world like ourselves. And if he has nobody, then the creation of the universe and blessing the devotees, etc., cannot be explained as in the case of liberated selves.

[^565]: " 'As in the present they have no omniscience, so also in the past and future."

[^566]: " 3 dharma and adharma."

 The unique arrangement of the universe (world) which has the capacity for special experiences is only natural, like the sharpness of thorns or like the closing and ope -ning of (the petals of) lotuses and lilies. Even the rising and setting of the moon, sun, and stars are all natural like the attraction of the magnet for iron filings.[^476]

 अत्राभिधीयते – स्वाभाविकी तावन्न भवति पृथिव्यादिरचना। दृष्टान्तो नैव तत्साधनस्य विद्यते । कण्टकादीनां च तैक्ष्ण्यं न स्वाभाविकमभ्युपेयते ॥

[^476]: " "

 Answer—The answer is that the creation of earth and so on, cannot be natural. There is no example which proves that it is brought about by itself. And the sharpness of thorns, etc., is not considered natural.

 Objection—It is said that the heat of fire, etc., is natural, so also the creation of earth, etc., is also due to the properties of ( many) things.

  Answer—Your argument suffers from many defects as even the construction of a mansion has properties of (many) things[^568].

[^568]: "1.But the mansion is not constructed merely by the properties of various things which make it up."

 Objection — It is still insisted that it is due to its nature.

 Answer—That is not proved. It is proper to understand the creation of the earth as accomplishing the purpose of experiencing the result of (one's own) dharma and adharma. It establishes later the existence of the agent, dharma and adharma.[^569]

 तस्मात् पृथिव्यादिरचना स्वाभाविकी न भवति, प्राण्युपभोगार्थत्वात्, प्रासादादिरचनावत् चन्द्रादिप्रवृत्तिर्न स्वाभाविकी, प्रवृत्तित्वात् अस्मदादिप्रवृत्तिवत् ॥

[^569]: "2.The previous experience gives rise to the later creation of the agent, dharma and adharma and so on."

 अस्मदादिप्रवृत्तिरपि स्वाभाविकीति चेत् –न– अग्न्युष्णत्ववन्नित्यत्वप्रसङ्गात्। न ह्यग्न्युष्णत्वं स्वाभाविकं

 Therefore the creation of earth, etc., is not natural as it has the purpose of providing experience for living beings as in the case of making of a big mansion. The movement of the moon and so on, is not natural as there is activity like the activity in ourselves.[^570]

 Objection—It is said that even the activity in ourselves is also natural.

[^570]: " 3.Movement or activity is controlled by an agent and hence is not natural."

 Answer—That is not so; for if it were so, there will be the contingency of its being permanent as in the case of heat in (of ) fire. The heat in fire is natural (and) is a fixed efficient cause which does not desire any benefit for itself as there is an absence of a subject.[^571]Whereas, in the case of creations which are the result of action, there is the desire to acquire something for oneself by a special cause; therefore it is not natural.

[^571]: " 4.The heat in fire does not benefit itself whereas activity by human beings is with a purpose. Therefore it is not natural like heat in fire."

 Objection—It is said that the desire for a fixed (definite) cause in the case of those making huge mansions and so on, is natural.

 Answer —Let there be that kind of a natural (behaviour); then, the natural desire for a fixed cause in the creation of the earth, etc., is like that of making a palace, etc.[^572]


[^572]: "5.In other words he is conceding that it is of a different order than that of the heat in fire. So there is no harm in accepting this which is not different from the view of the siddhanta."


 Then the discrepancy of nomenclature[^573]' does not create any difficulty as there is dependence on an agent of action; and your conclusion proves the opposite (of what you stated in the beginning).

[^573]: "1.The discrepancy between your view and our view is not there."

 The inferences that you have stated are against ordinary experience, inference and scriptural authority, so they are not trustworthy. We say that its being opposed to inference is due to having degrees of excellence. We say that its being opposed to scriptural authority is due to such statements as 'He who is omniscient, all-knowing'[^574]and 'He is the one controller'.[^575]

[^574]: " 2.Mund. Up., I.19."

 It is also in contradiction to all ordinary experience. Everyone including women (the gopis) and cowherds[^576], with their minds concentrated on the names of Gods like Śiva, Nārāyaṇa, etc., are always roaming around with distracted minds, even when prohibited, without listening to those prohibitions[^577]; with their heads bowed down they worship Parameśvara with handful of flowers; they also pray to achieve their purpose by this.

[^575]: "³Kath. Up., 6.12."

[^576]: " 4.This has to be taken as a samāhāra-dvandva compound to get this meaning."

[^577]: "5.This is probably a reference to the gopīs in the Kṛṣṇa story described vividly in the Bhagavata Purāņa."

 Objection—It is said that our inferences which indicate the absence of omniscience only contradict the conclusions of others[^578].

[^578]: "6.The opposition is between those who advocate omniscience and those who do not do so."

 Answer—That is no inference.

 Objection—Why not?

 Answer—Firstly your conclusion itself is defective. If you say that the intended meaning of the word īśvara is not one who is omniscient and thus (already) use the word īśvara then there is the defect of arguing about what is already proved."

 Objection—But that is what is intended by us.

 Answer—Even then, it is a fallacy as you are describing something not proved[^579].

[^579]: "The opponent has accepted the concept of Isvara while using it in his argument. Therefore there is a contradiction in questioning what one has already accepted."

 Objection—But we are saying that īśvara has no omniscience.

 Answer—Even then you are only proving what is already proved (by your own words). Moreover it is in contradiction to truth as well.





 Objection —How is that?

 Answer—One has to accept the reaching of a limit by the seeds of power and omnis -cience as they grow, as in the case of any measure (ascending scale). Then in the case of words which describe power and omniscience that have reached their limit they will be known only as 'īśvara' and 'sarvajña' (one who is omniscient ). And attaining the limit means without any limitation. As in the case of measure, there is its end in infinite measure, in space, or ātman, etc. And there are contradictions in your words which do not support what is arrived at through inference.[^580]

 किञ्चान्यत्–काष्ठाप्राप्तेश्वरत्वस्य च शब्दार्थस्य परित्यागे शब्दार्थवादः प्राप्नोति । न हि शब्दः परित्यक्ताभिधेयैकदेश उच्चरितः ॥

[^580]: "'By inference one arrives at the ultimate in power and omniscience but the opponent does not agree to that"

 अथ परिमाणादेरपि निरवधिकनिष्ठत्वं नेष्यते– सिद्धान्तविरोधः। आत्माकाशादीनां हि सर्वगतत्वाभावे, मध्यमपरिमाणत्वानित्यत्वादिदोषप्रसङ्गश्च। अथाप्यात्मनः सर्वत्र कार्यदर्शनात् सर्वगतत्वम्, तत्रापि शकुन्याद्यात्मनां मनुष्यगोचराकाशादिगतत्वं सामान्यतो दृष्टादेवानुमानात् स्यात् । तथा चेहापि सामान्यतोदृष्टानुमानत्वं केन वार्यते ॥

 Moreover, by giving up the meaning of the word Ïśvara as one who has reached the limit (of power and omniscience), there is only an assertion of the word (without any meaning)[^581].A word cannot be used when part of its denoted meaning is rejected. Even in the case of measure and so on, you cannot believe in its not having a limit, as that will be in contradiction to your own theory. If ātman, space, etc., do not have all- pervasiveness then there will be such defects as their being of middli -ng measure and being perishable, etc.

[^581]: "The correct meaning is not conveyed by rejecting what it conveys."

 Objection — Since one sees the effects of ātman everywhere there is all-pervasiveness.[^582]

 Answer—Then through the sāmānyatodṛṣṭa inference[^476] one can infer that the selves of birds and so on, are everywhere in space and in human beings. Thus who can avoid inference through sāmānyatodṛṣṭa here also?

[^476]: " "

[^582]: " The opponent changes the meaning of all-pervading by saying that one sees many individual selves everywhere and so is all-pervading."

 अथानुमानविरोधान्नावधार्यत इति चेत् — आत्मादीनामपि प्रमेयत्ववस्तुत्वादिभ्यः पृथिव्यादिवदित्यनुमानविरोधोद्भावना शक्यते \[कर्तुम्\] वक्तुम् । न च तावताऽत्रानुमानविरोधित्वम्, अनुमानाभावप्रसङ्गात् ॥

 Objection — It is said that it is not determined due to contradicting inference.

 Answer — It is possible to make the contradictory inferential statement that ātman



(space), etc., are also like earth, etc., because of the capacity to be known and because of being substances.[^584]

 It is not that there is contradiction of inference by that, in that context, but inference will cease to be a means of arriving at knowledge.

[^584]: "'This supports the Nyāya view where ātman and dik are also substances."

 Objection—It is then said that let there be no inference.

 Answer—Then there will be no trust in direct perception also.

 Objection—The validity of direct perception is because it gives rise to certain knowle -dge.

 Answer—In the case of inference also there is the rise of certain knowledge; so it also has validity.

 Objection—Inference is concerned only with the seen relation with the object smoke (in the case of fire), for instance.

 Answer—In that case also there will be an absence of inference. For instance-this place which has smoke is without fire because this place has no connection with fire which is directly perceived; thus it is like places seen to be without fire.^(**2**)

 अथ प्रमाणान्तरसंवादाददृष्टसम्बन्धविषयेऽनुमानस्यानुमानत्वमुच्यते, प्रत्यक्षमपि प्रमाणान्तरसंवादात् प्रमाणं भवेत्, प्रमाणत्वात्, अनुमानवदेव ।

 Objection—But, in such cases, when relation is not seen there is agreement with so -me other means of proof and so the inference has the nature of inference[^585].

[^585]: " Thus it need not be based on direct perception."

 Answer—Then even direct perception which has validity will be a means of valid proof because of its agreement with some other means of proof, similar to inference. Then it will also be without validity as there will be the absence of agreement with another means of valid proof[^586] and it is like the sāmãnyatodṛṣṭa inference. Therefore, the validity of sāmānyatodṛṣṭa inference cannot be affected because it has certainty.

[^586]: " Direct perception is what validates other proofs and to make it depend on some other proof is negating its validity."

 किं च— सामान्यतोदृष्टस्य मानत्वमनभ्युपगच्छतः स्वशरीरमरणसम्बन्धलक्षणस्यानुपलब्धपूर्वत्वात् सर्पादिभ्यो भयानुपपत्तिः । व्याधिप्रतीकाराय चिकित्सादिप्रयोगो न घटेत । मरणशङ्काकारणाभावात् । तथा जन्मनोप्युपलम्भाभावादात्मशरीरस्याजत्वं चिन्त्येत । हानोपादाननियोगाभावश्च स्यात् ॥ तस्मात् सामान्यतोदृष्टपरिमाणत्वादिसातिशयत्वसामान्यादीश्वरज्ञाननिरवधिकत्वसिद्धिः ॥

 Moreover, one who has not experienced the relation of death with one's own body cannot have fear from snakes and so on, which knowledge is obtained from

———————————————————————————————————————————————

**2.**In case inference is to be like direct perception then this would be the result. In other words it will be the end of inference itself. To state it as a syllogism it will be: (a) This place which has smoke is without fire. (b) Because this place has no relation with fire seen directly. (c) Wherever there is no direct perception of fire there is no fire in that place. (d) As in places directly seen to be without fire. (e) Therefore this place has no fire.



inference. Also the use of medicines, etc., in order to cure diseases, cannot be explained as there can be no fear of death as cause (in his case).[^587]

 Similarly since one has had no experience of birth one can think that one's body is unborn. It can also lead to the absence of rejecting and engaging in any task.

[^587]: "'Inference is the basis for all this behaviour and not a direct experience of death."

 Thus in common with the principle of gradual increase of measure and so on,which is generally inferred, there is the establishment of unlimited knowledge in Iśvara.

 किं चान्यत्—ईश्वरसर्वज्ञत्वस्य प्रतिषिद्ध्यमानत्वात् सत्त्वाभ्युपगमः, अ (नुप) पदार्थस्य प्रतिषेधासम्भवात् । न हि केवलो नेति (न) प्रयुज्यते । ईश्वरः सर्वज्ञो न भवतीत्युच्यते । तत्र क्वचित् सर्वज्ञत्वमभ्युपगतं भवति ॥

 तद्यथा— शशस्य विषाणं नास्ति, वन्ध्यायाः सुतो नास्ति, कुसुममाकाशस्य नास्तीति क्वचिद्विद्यमानानामेव विषाणसुतकुसुमादीनां शशादिसंबन्धेन प्रतिषेधः, तद्वदिहापि स्यात् ॥

  Moreover there is this additional point. As the omniscience of īśvara is being denied it means that there is its acceptance[^588]as it is not possible to deny a substance whch is not there. One does not use the word 'na' alone.[^476]When one says 'īśvara is not omniscient' there is understanding of the nature of omniscience as existing somewhere.

[^476]: " "

[^588]: " 'The concept of omniscience is granted as existing and is being denied in īśvara."

 For instance in the statements 'A rabbit has no horn', 'A barren woman has no son -', 'There is no flower in the sky', there is denial of the horn, son and flower which are existing somewhere, only as having relationship with a rabbit and so on. Similar is the case here too.

 किं च — ईश्वरः सर्वज्ञो न भवतीति, ईश्वरशब्दार्थसर्वज्ञत्वसम्बन्धप्रतिषेधादिना ईश्वरादन्यस्य सर्वज्ञत्वाभ्युपगमः। सम्बन्धिनावनभ्युपगम्य सम्बन्धप्रतिषेधो हि न शक्यः कर्तुम् ॥

-प्रसिद्धानन्तपरिमाणत्वेषु घटादिषु तत् व्यवस्थापयितुं युक्तम्॥

 Moreover the statement 'Ïśvara is not omniscient' denies the relationship with omniscience of someone who is denoted by the word īśvara; thus there is acceptance of omniscience in someone other than Iśvara. Without acceptance of the existence of both the relata one cannot deny the relationship.[^590] The relationship which is proved is being denied by you and the unproved is being accepted. But that is a futile exercise—as it is not possible to deny the (two) well-known meanings of the words īśvara and omniscience.

[^590]: "*Thus omniscience has to be accepted as existent."

 For instance by denying the well-known infinite extent of space (ether) by saying that space has not infinite extent, it is not proper (logical) to try and establish it in substances like pots, etc., which are well-known for not having infinite measure ( extent).

-शब्दार्थत्वाभ्युपगमात् । न हि भवत्यग्निरग्निशब्दार्थो न भवतीति ।

  Then if the (meanings of) the two relata, īśvara and omniscience, are denied then the conclusion will be in contradiction to the meaning of the very words used as it is correct to understand the meaning of īśvara and omniscience as the meaning denoted by the words īśvara and omniscience. It is not possible (to say) that fire is not the meaning of the word fire.

 Objection—The words īśvara and sarvajña do not have their meanings established.

 Answer—Even then it is not proper to deny their meanings since one does not have access to meanings (of words) which are not established.[^591]

 It is not proper to deny the presence of the woman who owns sheep on the top of the mountain which is not [known](#).Moreover, there is futility in the use of words as they would refer to something not established.

[^591]: "'One can only argue about the meanings one knows and not about the ones which are not known at all."

 अथ प्रसिद्धार्थयोरीश्वरसर्वज्ञशब्दयोर्निरवधिकेश्वरसर्वज्ञत्वाभ्यामप्रसिद्धाभ्यां गगनस्येव कुसुमैः संबन्धः कैश्चित् कल्पितः, स प्रतिषिध्येत—तथाऽप्यभ्युपेतार्थप्रतिषेधात् स्ववचनविरोधिन्येव प्रतिज्ञा स्यात्। सातिशयनिरतिशयानेकेश्वरसर्वज्ञव्यक्तिमत्सामान्ययोरीश्वरसर्वज्ञशब्दार्थत्वेनाभ्युपगमात् ॥

 Objection—But then, the relation between the established meaning of the words İśvara and omniscience and the not established relationship between īśvara having unlimited power and omniscience, is like the relation between the sky and flowers imagined by some people; and that is to be denied.

 Answer—Even then, as there is denial of the meanings already accepted, the conclusion will be in contradiction to your own words. One understands that the meaning of the words īśvara and omniscience, in general, is that there are many individuals who have increasing and decreasing power and knowledge.

 प्रसिद्धं हि लोके ईश्वरसर्वज्ञशब्दयोरुत्कर्षापकर्षयुक्तानेकव्यक्तिविषयबुद्धयुत्पादकत्वम्। न हि ग्रामाधिपतिरीश्वर इति द्वित्रिग्रामविषयाधिपतय उत्तरोत्तरेश्वरा न भवन्ति । यो वा कुटुम्बाधिपतिरीश्वरो न भवति सर्वैश्वासावर्थवानीश्वरशब्दः ॥

 It is well-known that the words Iśvara and omniscience induce ideas associated with many individuals connected with the idea of increase and decrease. If the head



of a village is īśvara then it is not as if the heads of two or three villages are not called greater heads; nor can the head of a family not be called īśvara. In all these contexts, the word Ïśvara is meaningful and understood by all.

 Similarly, to the grammarian, when the word omniscient is uttered it means someone having great knowledge (all-knowing about some subject). The meanings of the two words īśvara and omniscient have to be understood as īśvara and omniscient having or not having limits. Therefore, by denying that (the meanings), the conclusion will be in contradiction to the (general) understanding. This will be similar to the rejection of the greatness (all-pervasiveness) of space (ether), ātman, etc., by denying the meaning of the word great (all-pervasive).

 Objection —But the words īśvara (all-powerful) and omniscient cannot be without limits as they are not seen in the world. There is no īśvara as much as there is no man with two heads.

 Answer—Even then, since the words and their meanings are obtained (in the world), your conclusion will be contradicting what is obtained[^592].

[^592]: "'The tendency of the Vivaraṇakāra to repeat the same argument comes out clearly here."

 Through their respective seeds (marks) of power and omniscience gradually increasing, as it is possible to reach unlimited power and omniscience, as in the case of unlimited measure, their non-existence is not proved.

 अथ अविशेष्यैवेश्वरशब्दार्थः सर्वज्ञो न भवतीत्युच्येत वस्तुत्वादिहेतुभिरस्मदादिवदिति, तदा सर्वप्रमाणविरोधिनी प्रतिज्ञा स्यात् । प्रसिद्धेश्वरशब्दार्थस्यप्राकृतसर्वज्ञत्वस्य सर्वप्रमाणसिद्धत्वात्। यथा ईश्वरशब्दार्थः \[सर्वज्ञो न भवति\] प्रमेयत्वादिभिर्हेतुभिर्घटयदिवदित्युक्ते यत् ब्रूयात्तदेवाहं वक्ष्यामि ॥

 Objection—But the meaning of the word Ïśvara is to be understood as not qualified (by omniscience) and it cannot mean omniscient because it is like any other substance similar to us.

 Answer—Then your conclusion will be in contradiction to all proofs; it is well established through all proofs that the well-known meaning of the word Ïśvara (all powerful) is omniscience which is the topic under [discussion](#).

 I would now state what would be said (by you) in the form of an argument, that the meaning of the word īśvara cannot be omniscient, as it has to be known[^593],as in the case of a pot and so on.

[^593]: "*Literally it means that it has to have the mark of knowability, etc."

 इह सर्वज्ञशून्यं जगत्। कालो वा दिश आकाशं वा प्राणिमद्देशो वा प्राणिनो वा सर्वेसर्वज्ञशून्याः। प्रमाणानि वा सर्वाणि सर्वज्ञाविषयाणि।प्रमातारो वा सर्वज्ञस्याप्रतिपत्तारः,इत्येवंजातीयासु प्रतिज्ञासु निरवधिकेश्वरे सर्वज्ञे वा प्रतिषिध्यमाने, प्रसिद्धेश्वरसर्वज्ञशब्दार्थाभ्युपगमविरोधाः प्रतिज्ञादोषा वचनीयाः ॥



 This world has no omniscient person. Time, space or ether, or space with living beings, or living beings themselves, are all devoid of omniscience. As for the proofs all of them do not refer to an omniscient one[^594].And the knowers (wise ones) have not seen any omniscient one[^595].

[^594]: "'None of the proofs refer to an omniscient person."

[^595]: "These are the arguments that could be put forward by the pūrvapakṣin."

 Such arguments (propositions) denying the unlimited īśvara or an omniscient one are only contradicting the well-known accepted meaning of the words Ïśvara and omniscient; therefore their conclusions must be said to be defective.

 ननु च वन्ध्यासुतो नास्तीति, तच्छून्यं जगत् कालो वेति, प्रतिज्ञायमाने यथोक्तप्रतिज्ञादोषप्राप्तिर्भवेत्—नैष दोषः – वन्ध्यासुतसत्तालक्षणस्य प्रतिषेद्धव्यस्य वाक्यार्थस्येश्वरसर्वज्ञशब्दार्थवदप्रसिद्धत्वात् केवलशब्दप्रापितसन्निधानबुद्धिमात्रप्रतिपन्ने पदार्थ \[पदार्थे प्रतिषेध\] व्यापारोऽस्तीति वन्ध्यासुतास्तित्वस्य (वा नास्तित्वस्य) नाभ्युपगमोऽस्ति । ततो नाभ्युपगतप्रतिषेधदोषः ॥

 Objection — But then, the statement that the son of a barren woman does not exist; (and) the world or time is devoid of such a person will also be subject to the said defective conclusion.

 Answer— This is not defective. The meaning of the statement which denies the existence of the son of a barren woman does not have any established meaning, as in the case of the meanings of the words īśvara and omniscient. In this case, there is only the denial of the meaning which is just the putting together of an idea created by only words; therefore there is no acceptance or denial of a barren woman's son[^596].Therefore the denial is not defective (contradictory).

[^596]: " ³In other words it is not a matter of discussion at all."

 ननु चेश्वरः सर्वज्ञो न भवतीत्यत्रपि बुद्धिमात्रं प्राप्यमाणं प्रतिषिध्यते, न क्वचिदपि प्राप्नुवद्वस्तु (न) प्रतिषेद्धुं शक्यते प्रतिहस्तिनेव हस्ती। यदि च नञा वस्तु निराकरिष्यते, नञ्मात्रेणैश्वरवादिपक्षत्वमपि \[पक्षोऽपि\]निराकरिष्यते, (अतः) तस्मादिहापि बुद्धिमात्रप्रतिषेध इति नाभ्युपगतप्रतिषेधः प्रतिज्ञादोषः ॥

 सत्यमेवम् । किं त्वस्ति विशेषः । प्रमाणसिद्धवस्तुविषया बुद्धिर्वस्त्वन्तरे कालविशेषे वा प्रतिषिध्यते वस्तुसामान्यात् प्राप्नुवती यथा घटो नास्तीति । क्वचिद्विनाप्यर्थेन बुद्धिरेव शब्दप्रत्युपनीतसन्निधाना कल्पितवस्त्वन्तरा प्रतिषिध्यते । यथा वन्ध्यासुतो नास्तीति ॥

 Objection—But then, the statement that īśvara is not omniscient is also only denying the idea that is formed (by words); it is not possible to deny any object which actually exists like an elephant being driven away by a keeper. If by the use of 'na' (a negation) an object can be denied then, by simply using 'na' one can deny the views of those who are in favour of the concept of God. Thus, here also, it is only the denial of the idea formed (in the mind) and therefore it does not deny what is obtained nor is the conclusion defective.

 Answer—What you say is true but there is a difference. The idea that is formed on the basis of the universal of an object and which is obtained by proofs can be refuted by some other object or at some other time as in the example that 'there is no pot (here now)'. Sometimes even without any object, the idea put together and brought into existence by words and which is an object (only) imagined, is denied as in the



statement There is no son of a barren woman.'

 But where there is rejection of an existent object established by some other proof, there also there is the defect of denial of something which is obtained as in the statement— ‘The meaning of the word īśvara is not omniscient. The words 'īśvara' and ‘sarvajña' have the mark of the universal underlying both Īśvara and omniscient in their growth, and therefore they establish the existence of the unlimited Ïśvara and omniscience which is accepted[^597]; it is similar to the words great, many, all, infinite measure, etc[^598].

[^597]: "'The theists who believe in the existence of God."

[^598]: "²Some concept underlies all measurements and great implies a growth in that. So also there is some idea of limitation underlying all numbers, which by growing gives rise to the concept many. Similarly with the other concepts."

 These words like great, etc., denoting universals, which underly the concepts of greatness, etc., which are known to have degrees of growth, become the marks indicating the existence of individuals having unlimited (infinite) greatness, number, all-encompassingness, and infinite extent. This is so because the universals of greatness, etc., underlying the individuals which have degrees of greatness, have the capacity to envelop the individual having unlimited greatness. It cannot be possible that in the presence of both the pervaded and the one which pervades there is no pervasion[^599].But beyond the unlimited there is nothing to be pervaded, (pervaded will always be with limit), therefore there is decline of the universal pervader and then one is known by the pervaded only.

[^599]: " 'The vyāptivākya which is usually stated as 'yatra yatra dhūmaḥ tatra tatra vaḥniḥ' i.e., where dhūmaḥ is the vyāpya and vaḥniḥ is the vyāpaka."

 Thus, being established by right knowledge, the attempt to prove the absence of the meanings of the words Iśvara and omniscient is only a denial of the accepted meanings (of these words); therefore the conclusion is defective.

 न चेश्वरसर्वज्ञशब्दयोरतदर्थत्वमन्यार्थत्वं वा कर्तुं \[वक्तुं\] शक्यते । तथा शक्तिज्ञानैश्वर्याणां प्रतिपुरुषं समुच्चितानां सातिशयानां निरवधिकं तत्त्वं अतः \[नानुन्मत्तः \]प्रतिषेद्धुमुत्सहेतेत्यनुमानविरोधित्वं प्रतिज्ञायाः ॥

 Nor can the words īśvara and sarvajña not have these meanings, nor can they mean something, else. Then it will be that there is an attempt to deny a principle which is unlimited, (which is inferred) from the fact that qualities like strength, knowledge and power which have degrees of growth and excellence are present in every person, and thus the conclusion will be in contradiction to inference.

 Moreover there is another thing. By denying Iśvara which is imagined by another, one reaches the undesirable state of being able to read others' minds.

 Objection — It is said that it is from their words (that one understands this)[^600].

[^600]: "'The pūrvapakṣin wants to defend himself by saying he never claimed to read another's mind. He was only arguing from the meaning of words used by the siddhantin."

 Answer—Their words are not qualified by the marks which prove, through degrees of excellence, the existence of omniscience. In denying meaning to such statements there is denial of what is accepted and as mentioned earlier it is in contradiction to inference.

 Moreover there is also the non-establishment of marks like knowability, etc. How do you say that? Because that depends on the unlimited knowledge and power accepted by [us](#).Then if he should also accept something like that (knowability) then there will certainly be omniscience from what has been accepted.

 किं चान्यत् – अभ्युपगततादृक्प्रतिषेधे, यथा घटो घटो न भवति वस्तुत्वात्, पटवदिति, एवमिहापि स्यात् ॥

 किं च – निरवधिकस्यानभ्युपगमे, प्रमेयत्वादीनाम्\[अ\] पक्षधर्मत्वमाश्रयासिद्धत्वं च।तदभ्युपगमे हि किं साध्यं भवेत् ? यो हि तृप्तवन्तं ब्रूयात् माऽत्रात्सीरिति, किं तेन कृतं स्यात् ॥

 Moreover there is something else. To deny something accepted in such a manner will be like saying “The pot is not a pot as it is a substance, similar to that of cloth'; similar will be the case here as well.

 Moreover, if there is no acceptance of an unlimited principle then, there would be the absence of a locus and the non-establishment of a support for the knowability and so on, of objects. Once that is accepted what else is there to be proved. He who tells one who is satisfied with food, 'Do not eat food', what is it that is accomp -lished by him?

अथापि स्यात् – निरवधिकमीश्वरमभिसन्धाय तस्य सर्वज्ञत्वं निषेधामीति। नैदतपि युक्तम्सर्वज्ञत्वस्यापि निरवधिकत्वात् ॥

 Objection—But this is possible. Accepting an unlimited īśvara, I can deny his omniscience.

 Answer—Even that is not logical, as even omniscience is unlimited (has no limits).



 Moreover, possessing power and omniscience which have degrees, are subject to increase and decrease and do not have their primary meanings as īśvara and omniscient, as they are indefinite. So also the words great, etc., do not have their primary meaning with reference to pots which are of indefinite sizes but not so with reference to space, etc[^601] the word mahat or 'of great extent' can be used.").Similarly, here also, unlimited possession of power and omniscience refer to something definite and so are the primary meaning of the words. Rejecting the primary meaning of the words fails to achieve one's purpose.

[^601]: "'With reference to space (ether

 किं च— यथा भवता अनुमानागमप्रसिद्धेश्वरस्य प्रमेयत्वादिधर्मविकल्पतया सर्वज्ञत्वं निराक्रियते, तथैव प्रमेयत्वादिभिरचेतनत्वमपि घटादिवदेव प्राप्नुयात् । अविरोधात् । यथा प्रमेयत्वं \[अ\] सर्वज्ञत्वेन व्याप्तमेवमचेतनत्वादिभिरपि ॥

  Moreover, just as you are rejecting the omniscience of īśvara which is well-known through inference and scriptural testimony because you wrongly imagine that he should have characteristics like knowability, etc., similarly it would follow that along with knowability, etc., you will have to admit unconsciousness also (in īśvara) as in the case of pots, etc., as that would fit in without any contradiction. Just as knowab -ility is pervaded by lack of omniscience similarly it is (pervaded by) unconsciousness and so on.

  Objection—But that is in contradiction to perception.

 Answer—In this case also, how is it that you do not even give a side glance to the contradiction to inference and scriptural authority.

 On the basis of universal characteristics like knowability, etc., it is not possible to superimpose something somewhere, either for or against. As for substances, in all cases, there exists universals like knowability and so on[^602].But an object which is due to the imagination of one's mind cannot be suggested to be knowable, etc.

[^602]: "'In other words all actual things are knowable."

 Objection — He is (not omniscient) as he is ātman[^603].

[^603]: " ³Since Ïśvara is also a self he has the universal selfhood."

 Answer — Then, like a liberated self your God will have no knowledge [(consciousness](#)).

 Objection — But that is in contradiction to direct perception and so on.



 Answer—Here also (the argument) as before is that there is contradiction to inference and scriptural authority.

 As for the statement that no one knows of any Īśvara either in the past or in the future[^604], therefore, there is uncertainty (doubt) regarding the knowledge of Ïśvara at the present time (also) as in the case of living beings[^605],(the answer follows).

[^604]: "1As in the past so in the future also no one will know of a God. So how can one believe your words."

[^605]: " 2Living beings are the same now as they were in the past and will be so in the future by inference. Therefore if no God was known in the past why should it be different now, in the present time."

 However, those living in the past and future also having had and will also be havng various marks (means) like having degrees (and) would have been and would be adept at applying the means of right knowledge as they had or would have the

 capacity to apply the means of right knowledge like us (in the present time)[^606].

[^606]: "3The sentences connecting the three tenses are loosely done. Could this be the style of Ādisankara the Bhāṣyakāra whose style is impeccable?"

 Objection—But since Iśvara has nobody he is not omniscient, like a liberated self and space, etc.

 Answer—That is not correct as he has a body.

 Objection—All manifest and unmanifest (truths)[^607] are without bodies for it is said that anything with body is dependent on dharma, etc., thus this īśvara will be non-eternal.

[^607]: "4Beginning from the unmanifest prakṛti, mahat, etc., up to the manifest five gross elements, they are all without body."

 Answer—That is not so, for he is without body.

 Objection There is a contradiction between having a body and not having a body.

 Answer—That is not so; in the case of the same ātman which is in the process of liberation it has a body and when liberated it has nobody.

 Objection—In that case, as they are dealing with different times there is no contradiction[^608].

[^608]: "5Both the process of liberation and being liberated, do not refer to the same time. One deals with the present and the other with the future."

 Answer—That is not so; here also, we understand different times. Moreover, being Ïśvara, it is possible to be both[^609] at the same time. It is also proper that being Ïśvara, he is with instruments (like the body, etc.,) and without instruments. Thus there are the following scriptural statements-'Without a body in all bodies[^610]', 'Who is present in all things[^611]', 'He who is omniscient, all knowing'[^612]and so on.

[^609]: "6Having a body and not having a body."

[^611]: "8Br. Up., III.7.15."

 Objection—The scriptures have contradictory statements so they cannot be evidenc -e for the existence of Ïśvara.

 Answer—That is not so; since (the statements about īśvara) do not have to be supplemented by other texts. Even when some statement on ritual is there, it is not a proof, as it is only one amongst many indicatory marks given in the scriptural texts.

 Objection— There are injunctions for the study of the scriptures and also to perform the new moon and full moon rites as suppplementary to them.

 Answer—That is not so as there are other injunctions like the performance of jyotistoma sacrifice.[^613]

 And since the rites like jyotiṣṭoma, etc., are to be done on different occasions they do not supplement all of them. Thus because such texts like—'He is to be reflected upon and meditated upon[^614]',have him as the object, it is not logical to supplement them with rites like the 'agnihotra'[^615]sacrifice and so on.

[^613]: "'This is a sacrifice to Soma and it also stands for the type of a whole class of sacrificial ceremonies."

यथा गृहतदाविष्टयोः ॥

 Objection— But there is no result.[^616]

 Answer—That is not so, for such statements like 'He attains all worlds and all desires who has sought to know the Self and has realized it[^617]'have been uttered, keeping the result in view.

[^616]: "4From such texts as 'He is to be meditated on', etc., the opponents say no result can accrue."

[^617]: "Chānd. Up., VIII.7.1."

 Objection—But these are all simply praises and are supplementary to the injunctions advocating devotion.

 Answer —That is not so, there can be no praise through describing something nonexisting. The statement ['Vāyu is the swiftest god'](#) cannot mean that Vāyu is not the swiftest.

 Objection—There can be praise through referring to something not existing in some places.



 Answer —That is not so, as one is referring to something established through inference here.

 Objection — But since īśvara is connected with all effects (bodies) and instruments (sense-organs), he has relationship with the pleasure and pain of all living beings.

 Answer—That is not so, as there the causes are different. The causes for the connection, etc., with bodies of human beings are dharma and so on; it is due to the causes of dharma, etc., that there is connection with pain and so on. Iśvara has no dharma and so on. The connection of the bodies and their instruments has the unli mited power of īśvara, as their indicatory mark. That (relationship) is like a house and one who has entered it.

 अथ चक्षुरादिकरणत्वादस्मदादिवत् सर्वानुपलब्धिरिति चेत् -न- सर्वविषयग्रहणसमर्थानां प्रतिबन्धकारणाभावात्। सर्वगतानां हि करणानां \[अ\] धर्मादिसंवरणेन स्वविषयसङ्कोचः क्रियते। यस्य पुनरावरणं प्रतिबन्धक\[म\]धर्मादि न विद्यते,तस्य तदभावादशेषस्वविषयग्रहणानि करणानीति न दुष्यति ॥

 Objection—But, as in our case, there is no knowledge of everything due to the instruments (of knowledge) like the eye, etc[^618].'

[^618]: "'All the sense-organs of knowledge like ear, skin, eye, tongue and nose are indicated by adi."

 Answer—That is not so; in the case of those who have the capacity to know everything (like īśvara and yogīs) there is no cause for obstruction. The instruments (of knowledge) which are all-pervasive (by nature) are restricted to their own (limited) objects due to the covering of dharma (and adharma). In the case of one who has no obstructing cover like dharma, etc., there one finds that the instruments (of knowledge) grasp everything, because of the absence of obstruction. Thus there is no fault in the argument.

 अथवा सर्वप्राणिकरणैः \[ईश्वरः\] पृथगात्मनः करणाभावेऽप्यावेशगृह इव सर्वमनुभवति । न च प्राणिशून्यो विषयः कश्चिद्विद्यते, 'यः पृथिव्यां तिष्ठन्' 'योऽप्सु तिष्ठन्' इत्येवमादिश्रुतेरन्तर्यामिनाम्न ईश्वरस्य सर्वेष्ववस्थितत्व श्रवणात् ॥

 Or, even though the self (ātman) has no sense-organs, īśvara experiences everything through the sense-organs of all living beings, like one who has entered thehouse[^619]."). There is no object which is devoid of the sentient being. One comes to know from such scriptural statements as — 'He who dwells in the earth[^620]', ‘He who dwells in water[^621]’,' that īśvara, called the antaryāmī (inner being), is present in all.

[^619]: " ²This refers to both the immanent and transcendent aspects of Brahman (īśvara

[^620]: "Br. Up., III.7.3."

[^621]: "'Ibid., III.7.4."

 Again his pure sattva has the characteristics of eternal strength, knowledge and power, which are unexcelled; as it is all-pervading, it is like space (and) is connected with everything; it illumines all objects as it has everything as object (of knowledge); as it is not associated with dharma, adharma, etc., it has unobstructed power; thus,



even in the absence of a body and sense-organs, the omniscience of īśvara is established.

 चक्षुराद्यपेक्षमेव चित्तस्य रूपादिप्रतिलम्भसामर्थ्यमिति चेत् –न– ऐश्वर्यधर्माद्यभावाभ्यां परिहृतत्वात् ॥

 अपि च चक्षुर्ग्राह्यस्यापि चक्षुषा अग्रहणं लोके दृश्यते । चक्षुर्ग्राह्यं सत् सर्वं तमः सन्निमीलितलोचनैरपि स्वस्थान्तःकरणैरुपलभ्यते । तदेव चान्धतमसं विष्फारितनयनैरप्यन्यगतचित्तैर्नैव गृह्यते । यथा गृह्यमाण एवाकाशे प्रकाशः ॥

 Objection—The mind has the capacity to receive shapes (colours), etc., only with the help of the eyes and so on.  
 Answer—That is not so, as that is only in the case of those not having power belonging to īśvara.

 Moreover, in the world, one sees that, sometimes, objects of the eye (vision) are not perceived by the eye. When there is an object of vision which is total darkness, it is obtained by one's inner organ which is steady (attentive), even when the eyes are closed. And that same total darkness is not grasped by one with eyes wide open when the mind is away somewhere. It is like the light seen in space.

 अथापि प्रकाशाभावमात्रमेव तमो न वस्त्विति ब्रूयात् - तच्च न- अभावस्य वस्तुतिरोधानसामर्थ्याभावात् ॥

 अथ ग्रहणनिमित्तस्य प्रकाशस्याभावादेव घटाद्यग्रहणं, न वस्तुतिरोधायकं तम इति ब्रुवीत-न-चक्षुषः प्रकाशकत्वात् प्रकाशसाहायकापेक्षानुपपत्तिः । असति भिन्नजातीये वस्तुनि वस्तूनां तिरोधातृणि तत्र या च यावती च मात्रा प्राकशकत्वाच्चक्षुषा प्रकाश्येत । न हि प्रदीपः प्रदीपान्तरद्वैतीयकापेक्षः प्रकाशयति ॥

 Objection—It can be said that darkness is only absence of light and it is not a substance.

 Answer—That is not so; for absence has no capacity to conceal things.

 Objection—But objects like pots, etc., are not seen because there is an absence of light which in the cause for perception (their vision), and darkness does not conceal them.

 Answer —That is not so; since the eyes have light, there is no need of help from (another) light. In the absence of some different thing which conceals other objects, the eye should light up as much as it can light up. A lamp does not need the help of another lamp in order to light up objects.

 किं चान्यत् – चक्षुषः प्रकाशान्तरसहायत्वापेक्षतायां च निशायामपि ताराधिपतिप्रकाशद्वितीयेन चक्षुषा दिवस इव रूपादिग्रहणप्रसङ्गस्तिरोधानस्यासति निमित्ते ॥

 किं चान्यत्—अभावश्चेत्तमः, चन्द्रभासु निशायां भा (भव)न्तीषु तमसा मन्देन न प्रवर्तितव्यम् । सर्वात्मनैव हि तेन विनशनीयन् । भासां भावात् । भासां तु वस्तुत्वान्मन्दत्वपाटवादिविशेषो घटते, न (भावस्य) अभावस्य निर्विशेषत्वात् ॥

 Moreover there is another thing. In case the eye is in need of help of another light then even in the night the eye with the second light of the moon will be able to see shapes (colours) and so on, as in the day time, since there will be no cause for concealing things.

 Moreover there is another thing. If darkness is (just) an absence, then in the night when the moon is bright it should not appear as faint darkness. It should be totally



destroyed by that light which is there in all its brilliance because light has existence. Since light is a substance it is reasonable to have qualifications like faint or bright; but that cannot be the case with absence which is without any qualification.

 किं च—सहाया भावाच्चक्षुष उपलब्धिसामर्थ्याभावादग्रहणमित्येतदपि व्यभिचरति । यथा सत्यपि विद्युल्लताप्रकाशे तीव्रतरे विद्युल्लताविलासे च किं तद्दृष्टिर्नोपलभते । न हि विद्युतः सहायके दृष्ट -चकितत्वेनाग्रहणं विरोधाभावाद्युक्तम् ॥

 Moreover, the eye will not have the capacity to see things in the absence of help (from another light), and there will be the unusual occurrence of no perception (of objects). But even when there is a flash of lightning, though there is bright light, the eye does not see anything. When there is the presence of lightning, nonperception is due to being dazzled by it; it is not correct to say that it is ue to absence of perception.

 Moreover, in medical science, it is mentioned that the shadow (of a patient) is (either) sweet (soothing) or cold. That which is not a substance is neither sweet (soothing) nor cold. Similarly it does not need any medicine (or wholesome food). One does not speak of diet agreeing or not agreeing with something that does not exist.

 Moreover one obtains shadow from light. In case darkness is absence, then how does shadow come from light within the circle of illumination?

 Objection—Even if it is a substance there is the problem of both being in contradiction to each other[^622].'

[^622]: "'Light and shadow show totally opposite characteristics."

 Answer —That is not so; it is possible (to exist) like the snake and its poison. Just as the poison which is capable of killing a person is not deadly to the life of the snake, similar is the case with light and its shadow.

 Therefore, darkness is a substance, as it increases and decreases like light; it also excludes all contradictory objects like a pot; it also separates the one who knows ( from perceiving) like a wall.

 Thus the mind (internal organ) is capable of perceiving the objects of the senses even without the help of the sense-organs. One perceives that the ears, when covered, do experience sound. When the cavity of the ears is closed (covered) it is not possible to infer the presence of another ear[^623]. For instance, when the cavity of the ears of a

[^623]: " ²So one cannot say that the sound is heard by another ear."



deaf man is covered, he has no experience of that kind.

 किञ्च – प्रतिज्ञाज्ञानेनापि रूपादिग्रहणमिन्द्रियनिरपेक्षं दृश्यते ॥

 Moreover, one sees that forms ( shapes, colours) and so on, are perceived without the help of the senses through knowledge (gained) from propositions.

 Moreover there is this other thing-we cannot explain memory (if knowledge depended on the sense-organs); it is seen that the mind has the capacity, in varying degrees, to perceive. The dream memories which have for objects various forms and so on, are very clear.[^624]

 If perception of form (for instance) is brought about earlier also by the senses like the eyes and so on, along with the mind coming together, then even in the dream state it would have to be brought about jointly. But that is not so. It is well-known that in the experience of pleasure, etc., the mind is independent.

[^624]: "'In a dream the senses are not active and yet there is experience of objects."

 Therefore in the perception of objects, the senses are illumined by the mind[^625], which is independent by nature. Thus it is said “Through the channel of the senses[^626].’’ There is the following scriptural text also (in this connection) — By the mind alone he sees, by the mind alone he hears[^627].'

[^625]: " Literally it means that the senses are the mind's spots of illumination."

[^626]: "3VBh., on YS, I.7."

[^627]: "Br. Up., I.5.3."

 किञ्च–साधनापेक्षस्य विज्ञानसाधनादृतेऽपि तुलादौ दर्शनमात्रेणैव सुवर्णादिपरिमाणज्ञानं दृश्यते ॥

 Objection—Just as the senses depend on light (of the mind) so also, the mind also can perceive only with the help of the senses.

 Answer—That is not so; because there are exceptions. Animals which roam about in the night perceive shapes (forms) as in the daytime by a different, second (kind of) light[^628].And even when there is light, owls and so on, do not perceive forms, etc., in the daytime.

[^628]: "'It is not like the light in the daytime. So it is called a second kind of light."

 Moreover, one sees in the instance of weighing (gold, etc.,) which depends on weights, just by looking at it ( generally) there is knowledge of the weight of gold, etc., (in an expert) even without the help of any means to find it.

 अथ चेद्ब्रूयादानर्थक्यं चक्षुरादीनामिति–स वक्तव्यः – तुलादिवदेवान्यत्रार्थवत्त्वमिन्द्रियाणामिति । यथैव

 Objection—Then it can be said that the eyes and other senses are useless (serve no purpose).

 Answer—It must be said that the senses have their use in some places as in the case of weights (scales). Just as a man having great discrimination in the matter of weights (scales), can without the aid of weights, etc., by just looking, has the skills to determine the quantity of gold and so on, similarly in the case of the mind, due to its great purity, its capacity to perceive forms, etc., even without the aid of the eyes, etc., is not lost (obstructed).

 It is not as if the task which is accomplished by many is not done by one person. It is seen that a huge block of stone which needs many to lift it, is seen to be lifted by some strong men single-handedly.

 तथैवेन्द्रियसहायेनान्येषामन्तः करणेन गृह्यमाणा रूपादयः परमेश्वरचित्तसत्त्वेनानाकलित (वकर्णित)चक्षुरादिपरिस्पन्देन केवलेनैव गृह्यन्ते । काष्ठागतत्वाद्वेमल्यशक्त्यैश्वर्यप्रकर्षस्य ॥

 Similarly forms, etc., which are perceived by the mind with the help of the senses in the case of other people, are perceived by the pure sattva-mind of īśvara all alone, without the need of the vibration ( movement, activity) of (the senses like ) the eyes, etc. This is so because there (in Īśvara), the growth of pure strength and power has reached its limits.

 As for those belonging to the world (i.e., human beings), they being inferior, their minds need the assistance of sense-organs as their power, strength and knowledge has impurity of the form of ignorance (avidyā). This is like those who are weak getting together to lift a stone and so on.

 ये(षां) पुनःसंसारिण एव सन्त ईश्वरीभवन्ति बुद्धर्षभादयः, तेषां निरतिशयशक्तिज्ञानैश्वर्यानुपपतिः कालपरिच्छेद्यत्वात् । अभ्युपगच्छन्ति च तद्दर्शनश्लाघिनः कालपरिच्छेदनीयकं तेषाम् ॥

 As for those who attain Īśvarahood while remaining in the world like Buddha, Rṣabha and so on, they cannot have unlimited strength, power and knowledge, as there is limitation by time (in their case). Those who are the admirers of their philosophies[^629]' also admit their being limited by time[^630].

[^629]: "'Buddhism and Jainism respectively."

[^630]: " ²Buddha and others were born and lived in the world. Thus they were limited in time at one point and so differ from the īśvara in our system-so says the siddhāntin -. In case īśvara existed in the past it will go against unsurpassed excellence."



 The Ïśvara in our philosophy is not limited by time. This is to be inferred by the fact that the Buddhas were living in sometime in the past and had a beginning in time and they had qualities like power, etc., in increasing degrees but not known (to be unexcelled). Some infer this in three ways i.e., in the past he was not born, in the present he is not born, in the future he will not be born. That can only be the opposite of unsurpassed excellence[^631].

[^631]: "'Thus this īśvara is different from such well-known men as Buddha and others."

 तस्मात् बुद्धादीनां सिद्ध्यपेक्षत्वात्, पूर्वबुद्धानां कालाधिक्यप्राप्तेरुत्तरकालबुद्धस्यापि न निरतिशयश क्त्यैश्वर्यज्ञानत्वं विरुद्धम् । अथ तुल्यशक्तिज्ञानैश्वर्याणामेव तेषां समानराज्यराजानामिवासमानकालत्व मिति ब्रूयात्, तथापि बुद्धान्तरकालस्य व्याप्त्यभिलाषविघातान्निरतिशयैश्वर्याद्यभावः ॥

 अभिलषति हि कश्चित् बुद्धान्तरं वशीकर्तुम्, तद्विषयं च व्याप्तुम् । अनियतत्वादिच्छायाः बुद्धान्तरावशीकरणे च सर्ववशित्वं ही (नी) येत ॥

 Therefore the (perception of) Buddha and others is in need of proof. Though the earlier Buddhas have the advantage of living a long time ago still they could not possess unexcelled strength, power and knowledge as that would be in opposition to the Buddha coming after him[^476].

[^476]: " "

 Objection—But they have equal strength, knowledge and power like kings having equal kingdoms and they do not belong to the same time.

 Answer—Still, in a time after the Buddha there would be obstruction to the fulfilment of the desire ( of another Buddha) to have all-pervading knowledge[^633]and so there will be no unexcelled power. As desire has no limits, if one Buddha, for instance, wants to check another Buddha and decides to enter his sphere (of activity) then if he cannot control the other Buddha, his omnipotence would be reduced.

[^633]: " So there is limitation in the Buddha concept."

 अथ चेदुच्यते, बुद्धान्तरस्याननुग्राह्यत्वाद्रागाद्यभावाच्च तद्विषयव्याप्तावनभिलाष इति—अत्रोच्यते- यथैव प्राप्तबुद्धत्वस्य कंचित्कालमवस्थानमभिलाषपूर्वकम्, तथा बुद्धान्तरकालावस्थानाभिलाषेणावश्यं भवितव्यम् ॥

 Objection—Suppose it is said that another Buddha does not need any grace nor does he have any desire (attachment); therefore, there will be no desire (on his part ) to enter the other's sphere (of activity).

 Answer—Here it is said that staying in the state of Buddhahood attained for sometime was preceded by desire; thus in the case of another Buddha it has to necessarily be preceded by [desire](#). And there are many other living beings who can be



given grace, so the desire to stay for sometime is proper. And all those living at that time cannot be given grace by the future Buddha[^634].

[^634]: "'Some would have died before the future Buddha came into being."

 Though it is suffering for the Buddhahood[^635],still it has the purpose of giving blessings to living beings; therefore, the state of Buddha in other times has to be accompanied by desire. The followers of Buddha accept that the Buddha-nature which is free from pain was affected by avidyā etc., before the attainment of Buddhahood. Thus unexcelled (unsurpassed) strength, knowledge and power is not applicable in the case of Buddha, Rsabha or other tirthakaras.

[^635]: "VBh., under YS, I.25. An inference exhausts itself in reaching a general conclusion."

 कालानवच्छेदात्तु नैते दोषा अस्मदीश्वरे क्रमन्ते । शक्तिज्ञानैश्वर्याणां तु निरवधिकत्वानुमानात् । सातिशयत्वानवस्थितत्वादिदोषः नात्माकाशादीनामिवातिशङ्कनीयः ॥

 As the īśvara in our system is not limited by time, these defects do not apply to him. As his unlimited strength, power and knowledge is inferred, there should be no doubt of defects like his having degrees (of excellence) or his not existing, as in the case of the ātman, space, etc.

 Thus he indicates "sāmānyamātropasamhāre kṛtopakṣayamanumānam iti". In reaching the conclusion in general, of the existence of a special puruṣa having unsurpassed ( unlimited) strength, knowledge and power, “krtopaksayam" = that inference exhausts itself, therefore it has exhausted itself because of growing progressively. Thus it is stated in the inference 'wherever there is reaching a place there is motion'[^636].Thus inference is not competent to indicate the particulars like name, qualities and so on, of Ïśvara even when they exist, as (inference) has the capacity to inform us about universals only.

[^636]: " The general nature of an inference is being stressed here."

 तदेतदुक्तं भवति। यदैवं सतामपि गुणानां सामान्यप्रतिपादनकृतक्षयत्वान्न प्रतिपादकमनुमानम्, किमङ्ग पुनरत्यन्तासम्भाव्यमानसन्निधीनामनुमेयधर्मविरुद्धानामशक्त्यज्ञानधर्माधर्मानैश्वर्यादीनां \[न\] तत्प्रत्यायकमिति ॥

 न च स्वयमेव सर्वज्ञास्तित्वं नास्तित्वं वा बुद्धि (प्रति) पूर्वमाशङ्कयते । घटादिवत् सर्वज्ञसद्भावस्य स्वयमनभ्युपगमात्। न ह्यनिर्धारितशशस्वरूपः शशे विषाणमस्ति नास्तीति कश्चिदाशङ्कते ॥

 Thus it is said—In this way since inference exhausts itself in indicating universals it does not reveal the (individual) properties though [existing.](#) Then how can it reveal things which are totally unsuitable (to its sphere) and inaccessible (to it) and are opposed to the field of inference like lack of power, knowledge, strength, dharma, adharma, etc[^476].

[^476]: " "



 Thus there is no need to prove the opposite[^638]. The inference for the existence of omniscience (etc.,) does not need firstly, the proof of the inference indicating its absence. Inference does not have to wait for what some other person says. In the case of inference of fire from smoke, it does not wait for the statement of another speaker.

[^638]: "'The presence of omniscience and so on in Iśvara does not depend on the failure of the proof of the inference of the absence of omniscience and so on, in Ïśvara."

 Nor is the existence or non-existence of the omniscient one in itself to be taken to be doubtful, because the existence of an omniscient one is not experienced as one experiences a pot and so on. Until it is decided that it is truly a rabbit one does not doubt the existence or non-existence of the rabbit's horn.

 Objection—One doubts what comes through another's statement.

 Answer — It can then be said, even when it comes from another, how is the existence of an Isvara not known be doubted[^639].

[^639]: "'The Ïśvara concept is being accepted even when it comes through another's statement."

 Objection— It can be the illusion of another.

 Answer—That is not so; when no universal is perceived, illusion is not a cause. In mother-of-pearl no one sees a cuckoo erroneously. Thus it is said "samjñādiviśeṣa-pratipattirāgamataḥ paryanveṣyā[^640]".They are to be known from the scriptures like the Veda, Itihāsa, Purāna, Yoga, and Dharmaśāstra[^641].

[^640]: "³Knowledge of particulars like names and so on, are to be known from the scriptures."

[^641]: "4VBh., under YS, I.25."

“tasyātmānugrahābhāve'pi"[^642]= there is an absence of desire in him for self-gratification; “bhūtānugrahah prayojanam"[^476] = but his purpose is to give grace (kindness) to those living beings who are sunk in the mire of ignorance, as there is no one else who can give guidance, which is the boat to carry one over the sea of samsāra (the world of births and deaths). "jñānadharmopadeśena kalpapralayamahāpralayeṣu uddhariṣyāmīti" = through instruction of dharma and knowledge to those who have no other refuge, who have completely entrusted themselves to him, during the periodic dissolution and during the great dissolution, when the distinguished preceptors who had the knowledge of the scriptures blessed by īśvara had all been absorbed (in prakrti), then compassion rises in him again and again (in the form) 'I will save them'.

[^476]: " "

[^642]: "  ‘Ibid., i.e., “Though there is an absence of self-gratification in him"

 तथा चोक्तमादिविद्वानिति – आदौ विद्वान् आदिविद्वान् रजस्तमोभ्यामनभिभूतज्ञान इत्यर्थः । ज्ञानधर्मादि वा तत आदीयते इत्यादिः, आदिश्चासौ विद्वांश्च आदिविद्वान् निर्माणचित्तं संकल्पमात्रनिर्मितं योगिचित्तम्  




आवेशग्रहवदुपदेशनार्थम् अधिष्ठाय भगवान् परमर्षिः परमदर्शन इत्यर्थः । परमत्वं चागमतः । दर्शनार्थस्य वा गत्यर्थस्य वा धातोः ऋषेर्ग्रहणम् । परमर्षिरीश्वर एव कपिलनारायणादिसंज्ञः आसुरये प्रोवाचेति ॥

 “tathā coktamādividvāniti" = the one who knew from the beginning is “ādividvān”,i.e., he is one whose knowledge is not overpowered (affected) by rajas and tamas. Or it can mean that knowledge and dharma begins from him; the knower who is the beginning (beginner ) ; he assumed a “nirmānacittam adhisthāya" = mind created by mere intention, like one entering a house, for the sake of instructing (others). "bhagavān paramarṣiḥ" = one who is the highest seer; his being the highest is known from the scriptures. The word 'rsi' has to be understood as formed either from the root, meaning to see (rs) or from the root meaning to go (r). The highest rsi is īśvara himself called Kapila, Nārāyana, etc., “āsuraye provāca" = ( who) taught āsuri.

 तस्मात् प्रधानपुरुषव्यतिरिक्तः सर्वप्राणिभावकर्मफलपरिस्फुरणज्ञानात्तदनुग्रहकारणम् ईश्वरः सिद्धः। स प्रकृष्टसत्त्वधनोपादान ईश्वरः कथं कर्ता ? कथं चानुग्रह्णाति ? इत्येवमादि न चोदयितव्यम्। आगमतः पर्यन्वेष्या इत्युक्तत्वात्। अनुमानस्य च तद्विषयस्यानुपपत्तिः विशेषसंबन्धाग्रहणादिति ॥ २५ ॥

 Therefore it is established that Iśvara is different from (both) pradhana and puruṣas and is the source for grace for all living beings because of having knowledge of their states, and the pulsating result of their actions. Such questions as how does that īśvara having pure sattva as wealth create (the world), or how does he bestow grace (on his devotees) cannot be asked. They are to be “āgamatah paryanvesyā" = sought from the scriptures. These are beyond the scope of inference, as it does not deal with special characteristics and their relationships.

 स एषः—

 This same Ïśvara is

पूर्वेषामपि गुरुः कालेनानवच्छेदात् ॥२६॥

 The guru even of the foremost (gods like Brahma and others and sages like Angiras and others) because of being unconditioned by time.

 पूर्वे हि गुरवः कालेनावच्छिद्यन्ते । यत्रावच्छेदार्थः कालो नोपावर्तते स एष पूर्वेषामपि गुरुः । यथाऽस्य सर्गस्यादौ प्रकर्षगत्या सिद्धः, तथाऽतिक्रान्तसर्गादिष्वपि प्रत्येतव्यः ॥ २६ ॥

 The foremost gurus (like Brahma and Angiras and others) are indeed conditioned by time. He in whom time has no relation in the sense of limitation, that same (Person) is the guru of the foremost (gods and sages) also. Just as He is the perfected through excellence, at the beginning of this creation, so also He should be recognised (as the perfected) at the beginning of the creations which have gone by.

 सः यथोक्तरूपः परमेश्वरः पूर्वेषामपि गुरूणाम् अभ्युदयनिःश्रेयससर्वसाधनसाध्यसंबन्धोपदेशिनां गुरुः तेषामपि ज्ञानोपदेशस्य कर्तेत्यर्थः । तदुद्भवत्वात् सर्वज्ञानानाम् \। यथा ज्वलनलवणजलधिसमुद्भवा विष्फुलिङ्गलवणकणाः ॥

 Parameśvara of the above-mentioned nature is the guruh = preceptor i.e., the one who gives knowledge to pūrveṣāmapi = the ancient preceptors i.e., those who teach the relationship between the means and the ends of both material prosperity and spiritual bliss. This is so because he is the source of all knowledge, just as sparks of fire are from a huge blaze and drops of salts are from the ocean.

 We have mentioned his being the first knower by the phrase kalenānavacchedāt. The other teachers are so limited-i.e., they are limited (qualified) by past, future or present time. Whereas that Iśvara is inferred by them to be eternally liberated as ( already inferred) by us.

 कस्मात् पुनस्तस्य वस्तुत्वे गुरुत्वसामान्ये च सति नावच्छेदकः काल इति चेदाह — यत्रावच्छेदार्थः कालो नोपावर्तत इति । यस्मिन्नीश्वरे विषये अवच्छेदार्थः प्रस्थादिवत् परिच्छेदकरः नोपावर्तते न परिच्छेदकत्वेनेश्वरं विषयीकरोति सर्वपरिणामिवस्त्ववच्छेदकरोऽपि सन् ॥

 Objection—How is it that though he has reality (exists as a substance) and is like a teacher, he is not limited by time.

 Answer— “yatrāvacchedārthah kālo nopāvartata[^644]". In the case of īśvara there is no delimitor like a measure and so on; i.e., one cannot talk of Ïśvara in terms of limitation though it can limit all objects that are subject to change.

[^644]: "'The reading available and commented upon by Vācaspati Miśra, Vijñānabhikṣu and others is 'yatrāvacchedārthena. . . .'"

 ननु चेश्वरप्रकृष्टसत्त्वस्य प्रधानकार्यत्वात्, प्रधानकार्यस्य च कालावच्छेद्यत्वात्, कस्मात्तत्सत्त्वं नावच्छिद्यते पुरुषस्वरूपं हि सर्वेषामेव कालानवच्छेद्य (मिति नाशङ्कनीय) मपरिणामित्वात् पुरुषस्य ॥

 अथ मन्येथाः – तन्त्रान्तरप्रसिद्धेश्वरवत् सत्त्वनिरपेक्ष ईश्वर इति तदयुक्तम्- प्रकृष्टसत्त्वोपादानाभ्युपगमात् ॥

अथापि मन्वीथाः—ईश्वरसत्त्वात् प्रवृत्तमेव कार्यमवच्छिनत्ति कालो नेश्वरसत्त्वमिति— तदप्युक्तम् – व्यक्तस्य परिच्छेद्यत्वात्। व्यक्तं चेश्वरसत्त्वम् ॥

 Objection — But then, as the pure-sattva of īśvara is the effect of pradhāna, and the effect of pradhāna is delimited by time, so how is that ( pure) sattva not limited; moreover, only the essence of purusa, which is in everyone, is not limited by time, as purușa does not change. You may think that Īśvara is not affected by his pure-sattva, as in the case of īśvara well-known in other schools[^645].

[^645]: " This is perhaps a reference to saguṇa-brahman in Advaita Vedānta."

  Answer—That is not right. We have accepted that he is endowed with pure-sattva.

 Objection—You may also think that time limits the effect which comes into being from the pure-sattva of Īśvara but it does not limit the sattva of īśvara itself.

  Answer—That is also not right. That which is manifest is delimited and the sattva of īśvara is manifest.

 अथाप्यभिसन्दधीथाः– प्रधानावस्थमेवेश्वरसत्त्वमिति – तदनुपपत्रम् – ज्ञानानुपपत्तेः ॥

 अथापि प्रतिपद्येथाः–सत्कार्याभ्युपगमाद्वीजफलवल्लरीकुसुमादिवज्ज्ञानादीनां प्रधानावस्था यत्सत्त्वमेवेति- तच्च न साधु–व्यवहारयोग्यत्वात् । सर्वेषां च तथा सत्यनवच्छेद्यत्वं ज्ञानादिसत्तामात्रसम्बन्धाविशेषात् प्राप्नुयात् ॥



 Objection—You may say that the (pure) sattva of Ïśvara exists in pradhana in a latent state.

 Answer — That is not correct, then there can be no knowledge arising from it.

 Objection—You may also say – by accepting the doctrine of satkāryavāda[^646], knowledge, etc., are only the pure sattva existing in pradhāna in a latent state as in the existence of flowers, creepers, (leaves), fruits and seeds[^647].

[^646]: "'The doctrine followed by Sankhya-Yoga saying that all effects are only actualisatio -ns of what exist in a potential form in the cause."

[^647]: " Flowers, leaves, fruits, etc., are all present in the seed in a potential state and are thus not different from the seed."

 Answer—That is also not right, because it has to be fit for ordinary day-to-day life. And if everything were in this manner unlimited, then there would be just the existence of knowledge without any relationship (between the knowledges of different people).

 अथापि ब्रुवीथाः – व्यक्तत्वे सत्यपि कार्याणां कस्यचित् परिच्छेद्यत्वं कालीनं कस्यचिन्नेति— तच्च न—न्यायविरोधात् ॥

 अथापि प्रत्यवतिष्ठेथाः, ईश्वरसत्त्वस्य कालापरिच्छेद्यत्वमागमसिद्धमिति – तच्च न–अवद्योतकत्वादागमस्य ॥

 अथाप्याचक्षीथाः—विद्यमानस्यैव कालापरिच्छेद्यत्वस्याज्ञातस्यावद्योतक आगम इति–तच्चापि न—निरोधादिसमनुष्ठाननिमित्तत्वात् काला (न) वच्छेद्यो वैमल्यादनवच्छेद्यश्चेति विरुद्धं स्यात् ॥

 अत्रोच्यते—ईश्वरसत्त्ववैमल्यप्रकर्षापेक्षत्वात् कालानवच्छेद्यत्वस्यादोषः ॥

 Objection—You may still say-though the effects are manifest, some of them are limited by time and some are not.

 Answer — That also cannot be, as it is against reason.

Objection—You may reply that the (pure) sattva of īśvara being unlimited by time, is established by the scriptures.

 Answer—That is also not right because scripture only indicates[^648],(throws light onfacts).

[^648]: " *Scripture does not establish anything, it only indicates things."

 Objection—You may again say that scripture indicates only that which exists but which is not known and which is not limited by time.

 Answer—That is also not right; since it is the cause for the practice of restraint and[so on](#), that will be limited by time[^649]; s on the other hand, being free from taint (impurity), it is also unlimited by time — thus there will be a contradiction. Thus it is saidthat because the sattva of Ïśvara is absolutely pure without any impurity, it is proper that it is unlimited by time.

[^649]: "'nirodha is in time; thus it is limited by time, though in that state it is a state of pure-sattva and should not be limited by time."

 यथा अन्येषां गुरूणां योगधर्मादिसमनुष्ठाननिमित्तत्वात् कालानवच्छेद्यो वैमल्यप्रकर्षः, तथा न भगवतः । कथम् ? सर्वदाऽत्यन्ततिरोभूतरजस्तमस्त्वादनपेक्षितधर्मादिनिमित्तं सकलार्थावद्योतकरं कालानवच्छेद्यं सत्त्वस्वरूपवद्भगवत्सत्त्वे ज्ञानम् ।



 तथा तत्कार्यमप्युत्कर्षः कालेन नावच्छिद्यते । यथा चाग्नेरुष्णप्रकाशावग्नौ कालानवच्छेद्यौ, तथा भगवत्स -त्त्वस्य वैमल्यज्ञानप्रकर्षास्तत्सत्त्वे कालानवच्छेद्यतामुपयान्तीत्येतदपेक्षयाभिहितं यत्रावच्छेदार्थः कालो नोपावर्तत इति । न त्वकार्यापेक्षया ह्युच्यते ॥

 Objection— In the case of other teachers the absolute purity being the cause for practice of yoga and dharma, etc., is unlimited by time but that is not the case with īśvara — why is that?

 Answer—That, at all times, has the total disappearance of both rajas and tamas therefore, it does not depend on dharma (yoga), etc., as a cause (for purity); the knowledge of the pure-sattva of īśvara is of the essence of sattva, unlimited by time and is the illuminator of all objects.

 Similarly, the excellence which is its effect also transcends time. Just as heat and light of fire is not limited by time in fire, so also the absolute purity of knowledge (which is the effect) of the pure-sattva of īśvara, transcends time in that sattva. Thus it is said that "Time does not apply as a limitor there"[^650]¹ which is said with reference to the effects[^651].

[^650]: "'VBh., under YS, 1.26."

[^651]: " Literally it means 'not without reference to the effects'."

 गुरुत्वं हि नावधिमत्। तदैवाह—यथाऽस्य सर्गस्यादौ ज्ञानवैमल्यप्रकर्षगत्या सिद्धः सर्गादिजन्मनामनुमेयतया सिद्धः आगमतश्चाज्ञायि, तथाऽतिक्रान्तसर्गादिष्वपि तत्कालजन्मनां ततः प्राक्तनानामपि सिद्धः।तथा भविष्यत्कालेऽप्यनुमानागमाभ्यामवगम्यते ॥

 अस्य च सूत्रस्येदं प्रयोजनम्—यथा दृष्टा गुरवो ज्ञानधर्माद्युपदेशित्वादनन्यशरणैरनवरतमुपास्यन्ते, तथा भगवानयमपि सर्वगुरूणामपि गुरुत्वात्ततोऽपि विशेषेण नारायणादिनामा (दीनाम) नन्यचेतोभिः स्वहृदयेनानिशं धारयितव्य इति ॥

 His role as a teacher is without limit. Thus he says, “yathāsya sargasyādau prakarṣagatyā siddhaḥ" = his perfect knowledge is established and known by the creation of beings at the beginning of (all) creations and also by the scriptures. “tathā’tikrāntasargādisvapi" = this is so established in the case of those living in those times i.e., in the case of those living in ancient times. Similarly, through inference and the scriptures, one understands it for the future times as well.

 The purpose of the sūtra is this-just as the present-day teachers are worshipped continuously by those who have no other support because they advise them regarding knowledge and dharma and so on, similarly this Isvara also, being the teacher of all teachers, and more specially of such gods as Nārāyaṇa and others should be meditated upon in one's heart, continuously.

 यथा दृष्टगुरव उपासनेनाभिमुखीकृतास्तदुपासनपराननुगृह्णन्ति तथाऽयं परमगुरुरप्यभिध्यानमात्रेणानुग्रहं करोति । तथा च श्रुति—

“यस्य देवे परा भक्तिर्यथा देवे तथा गुरौ ।  
तस्यैते कथिता ह्यर्थाः प्रकाशन्ते महात्मनः ॥” इति ।

स्मृतिरपि—



**“मत्कर्मकृन्मत्परमो मद्भक्तः सङ्गवर्जितः ।  
निर्वैरः सर्वभूतेषु यः स मामेति पाण्डव ॥”** इति ॥ २६ ॥

 Just as the present-day teachers, faced with devotion (from pupils), bestow grace on those devoted (to them) similarly īśvara the highest guru as well, bestows his grace just because of his (devotee's ) deep meditation on him. Thus there is the following scriptural text saying 'He who has the highest devotion to god and to his guru as to god, to him the following great glories are manifest[^652]." So also there is the following traditional saying– 'He who acts for me, he who sees me as the supreme, he who is my devotee, free from attachment, without hatred towards any, he attains me O Pāndava[^653].

[^652]: " 'Subālopanisad, Svet. Up., 6.23."

[^653]: "Bha. Gītā, XI.55."

**तस्य वाचकः प्रणवः ॥ २७ ॥**

 The word denoting Him is Om; or his designation is Om.  
 वाच्य ईश्वरः प्रणवस्य ।

 किमस्य सङ्केतकृतं वाच्यवाचकत्वम् ? अथ प्रदीपप्रकाशवदवस्थितम् ? इति ।

 स्थितोऽस्य वाच्यस्य वाचकेन सह सम्बन्धः । सङ्केतस्त्वीश्वरस्य स्थितमेवार्थमभिनयति । यथा—

अवस्थितः पितापुत्रयोः सम्बन्धः सङ्केतेनावद्योत्यते 'अयमस्य पिता', 'अयमस्य पुत्रः' इति ।

 सर्गान्तरेष्वपि वाच्यवाचकशक्त्यपेक्षस्तथैव सङ्केतः क्रियते । सम्प्रतिपत्तिनित्यतया नित्यः शब्दार्थसम्बन्ध इत्यागमिनः प्रतिजानते ॥ २७ ॥

 İśvara is denoted by Om. Is this relation between the denoter and the denoted made by convention or is it like the light of a lamp only revealing what is already present?

 The relation of this denoted with the denoter is fixed. But the usage of Ïśvara only reveals the fixed meaning. Just as the relationship which is already present between father and son is revealed by usage in the form 'this is his father', 'this is his son'.

 Even in other creations usage is with reference to the power of (the relation between) the denoted and the denoter. Those who are well-versed in the scriptures know that the relationship between the word and its meaning is permanent because of the permanency of similar usage (in successive generations).

 ईश्वरप्रणिधानादित्युक्तं, स कथं प्रणिधातव्यः ? किं च तत्प्रणिधानसाधनम् ? येन प्रणिधाता प्रणिधत्त इति तत्प्रणिधानसाधनप्रतिपादनार्थमाह—

तस्य वाचकः प्रणव इति । तस्य ईश्वरस्य यथोक्तलक्षणस्य वाचकः अभिधायकः प्रणवः सास्त्रादिमत इव गोशब्दः ॥

 It has been mentioned 'Or by devotion to īśvara'[^654];( so ) how is one to perform devotion to him, and what is the means of that devotion? In order to indicate the means of devotion to him, through which the devotee is devoted to him, he says tasya vācakaḥ praṇavaḥ. Om is the vācakaḥ = denoter of īśvara of the above-mentioned  

[^654]: " 3YS, I.23."




nature, as the word 'go' is the denoter of something having a dew lap and so on[^655].

[^655]: "'It is interesting to see the Vivaraṇakāra using this example very often. It reminds one of the Paspašāḥnika of the Mahābhāṣya."

 प्रकर्षेण नूयते स्तूयते अनेनेति प्रणवः। यदि वा, प्रणौति स्तौतीश्वरमिति प्रणव ओङ्कारः। प्रणिधीयते चानेन भगवान् प्रणिधातृभिरिति, प्रणमन्ति वा अनेनेति, प्रणिधत्ते वा तेन भगवन्तं चेतसीति, धाञो वकारोपजनं कृत्वा । शब्देन हि परोक्षाणामर्थानां मनसि प्रणिधानं मेरुरिन्द्र इति यथा ॥

 The word 'pranava' can be explained as — (1) that by which he is praised perfectly—

. Or (2) that which praises god is 'pranava or Omkāra. Or (3) God is worshipped by his devotees through this word. Or (4) God is bowed down to, by uttering this word. Or (5) through this word they meditate upon God in their minds. Here the final 'dhā' (in pranidhā ) stands for va' [(in pranava)](#).There is meditation in the mind on objects which are not directly seen, through (the help of) words, as in the worship of mount Meru or god Indra.

 तस्य चोङ्कारस्य वाच्यः ईश्वरः । अन्वर्थं खल्वपि निर्वचनम् । अवतेः रक्षणाद्यर्थादनिष्टिलोपश्चेति । प्रणिधातॄन् संसारादवतीति, गमयति वा संसारिणं निर्वाणमिति, निरतिशयं वा प्रीणयति, समाध्याद्यनुग्रहेणावगमयति वा परमार्थमित्येवमाद्यर्थानुगतम् सर्वथा तु नेदिष्ठं प्रियं नाम भगवतः ॥

 “vācyah īśvarah” = And the denoted meaning of that Om is īśvara. The sound is also in keeping with its meaning. As 'ava[^476]'has the sense of protection it means that there is also exclusion (removal) of that which is unpleasant.

[^476]: " "

 He protects his devotees from the world (of births and deaths); or he leads one in the world to nirvāṇa; or he brings unsurpassed joy (to his devotee); he makes him attain the supreme through samadhi, by his grace-thus it has all these underlying meanings; but they are always associated with the most intense love for [God](#).

 तेन हि मनसि सततं प्रणिधीयमानः प्रसीदति । तथा चानेकशः श्रुतयः– 'ओं खं ब्रह्म', 'ओमिति ब्रह्म' इत्यादयः। स्मृतयश्च ‘ओं तत्सत्' इति । 'ओं विश्वं विष्णुः' इत्यादयः । ओंशब्दस्य कृदन्तं यन्मान्तमित्यव्ययत्वाद्विभक्तिनिवृत्तिः ।

 Being meditated upon constantly in the mind through that (Om) he is pleased.Thus there are many scriptural texts like — 'Om kham Brahman[^657]',' 'Brahman is Om[^658]' and so on. There are also traditional texts like— 'Om, tat, sat’[^659],7 ‘Om Visnu is al[^660]l' and so on. The word 'Om', as it ends in 'm', is a primary affix which is an indeclina -ble and thus has no case endings.

[^657]: " Br. Up., 5.1.1."

[^658]: "Taitt. Up., 1.8.1."

[^659]: "Bha. Gītā, 17.23."

[^660]: " 'Visnusahasranāmastotram."

 किमस्य सङ्केतकृतं वाच्यवाचकत्वं ? अथ प्रदीपप्रकाशवदवस्थितमिति । किं चातः ? यदि तेन भगवता अन्यैर्वा संव्यवहारार्थमस्य नामेदमस्त्विति संकेतितम्, ततोऽस्य प्रागोंशब्दावाच्यत्वादोंशब्देन वा प्रणिधातारः  




प्राण्यधिषत, अन्येन वा नामान्तरेणाधीतवन्तस्तथेदानीमप्यस्तु,किमोङ्कारविशेषवचनेन । अथापि प्रदीपप्रकाशवदवस्थितं, तथाऽपि प्रथमश्रवणेऽपीश्वर उपलभ्येत यथा प्रकाशन सविता ॥

 “kimasya sanketakrtam vācyavācakatvam"? "atha pradipaprakāśavadavasthitamiti”.!

 Objection—What does this mean? If by God or by some others, this convention for common usage was decided at sometime in the form 'let Om stand for God'[^661], but before that, since Om did not denote God, devotees worshipped God either through the word 'Om' or they worshipped god through some other name—so let it be the same now also. Why is the word Om specially mentioned.

[^661]: "'VBh., under I.27."

 Answer—The relationship is fixed like that between the lamp and its light. Even on hearing it for the first time one understands God as the Sun is known by its light.

 किं च–सङ्केतोऽप्यनर्थक स्थितसम्बन्धत्वात् । अथापूर्वं सङ्केत्येत, पूर्वोक्तदोषप्रसङ्ग इति मन्यते अत्रोच्यते—स्थितोऽस्य वाच्यस्य वाचकेन सम्बन्धो यदि नित्यः शब्दो यदि वा अनित्यः, सङ्केतस्तु तमेव स्थि -तं सम्बन्धमवज्वलयति ॥

 ननु चोक्तं—स्थितश्चेत् प्रथमश्रवणेऽपि तं प्रतीयुरिति । उच्यते – न हि प्रत्याय्यप्रत्यायकसम्बन्धः शब्दार्थयोः स्थितोऽपि सन्निन्द्रियेण गृह्यते । यथेन्द्रियार्थयोः । अप्रत्यक्षे हि वाच्यवाचकशक्ती ॥

 Objection—Then, if there is a fixed relationship it is useless to have a convention (relating to it). If it is a convention dealing with something unknown, there will still be the above-mentioned defect[^476].

[^476]: " "

 Answer—It is said here “sthito'sya vācyasya vācakena sambandhah” = whether the word is eternal or non-eternal, convention only reveals that fixed relationship.

 Objection—But then, if it is fixed, then even when heard for the first time people should understand it.

 Answer—The relationship between a word and its meaning is that between what conveys an idea and the idea itself; even if it is fixed it is grasped by the senses as in the case of the senses and sense-objects. Thus the capacity of the word and the capacity of its meaning are not directly perceived.

 ततश्च येनोच्यते शब्दादर्थोऽनुमेय इति तदसत्। सम्बन्धाग्रहणात्। परप्रयोगव्यङ्ग्यत्वाच्च सम्बन्धस्य\।न ह्यनुमानं परप्रयोगमपेक्षते ॥  
 अथ ब्रूयादनुमितात् संबन्धादर्थानुमानमिति । स वक्तव्यः कथमनुमितः शब्दार्थसम्बन्धः ? इति ॥

  सचेत् ब्रूयात् – कार्यदर्शनादर्थं हि प्रतीत्य पश्चादनुमिनोति तत्संबन्धम् । यथा चक्षुषा रूपमुपलभ्य चक्षुस्संबन्धमिति । स प्रतिवक्तव्यः– सिद्धा तर्हि विनाऽनुमानेन शब्दादेव प्रतिपत्तिरिति ॥

 यो हि ग्राष्टपाकेनैव कृतार्थः किं तस्य किलोशिपाकेन । अथासकृत् प्रयोगदर्शनाद्गृह्यते सम्बन्धः, यथाऽग्निधूमयोरिति चेत् – न तु ब्रूमः न हि सहस्रेष्वपि प्रयोगेषु प्रत्यक्षेण शब्दार्थयोः सबन्धो गृह्यते यथाऽग्निधूमयोरादावपि संबन्धो गृह्यते । वाक्येऽप्ययमेव ॥

 Objection—Then the meaning (of the word) can be inferred by one who has uttered the word.  




 Answer—That is not correct as the relationship is not grasped. Moreover, the relationship depends on the usage of others and inference does not depend on others'usage[^663].

[^663]: " 'As it is fixed, it cannot depend on inference."

 Objection—It can be said that an object can be inferred from the inferred relationship.

 Answer—You will have to mention how the relationship between word and meaning was inferred.

 Objection—It can be said that after seeing the effect and knowing its meaning the relationship was later inferred. This is like inferring something related to the eyes after seeing a form with the eyes.

 Answer—He can be refuted by saying that knowledge is established by the word alone without any inference. When one is satisfied by cooking food with one kind of grass what does he gain by cooking it with another kind of grass.

 Objection— The relationship is grasped by seeing the combination (usage) many times, as in the case of smoke and fire.

 Answer—We say that it is not so; even when there is usage thousands of times, the relationship between a word and its meaning is not directly grasped, as in the case of the relation between fire and smoke which is directly seen even at the very beginning[^664]. This applies also to sentences.

[^664]: "²One is directly perceived but not the other."

 तस्मादवस्थितमेव वाच्यस्येश्वरस्य वाचकेन प्रणवेन सम्बन्धमवद्योतयति सङ्केतो यथा स्थितं पितापुत्रसं बन्धम्। सङ्केतोपायापेक्षत्वात् प्रथमश्रुतान्नार्थः प्रतीयते । यथा चक्षुष आलोकाभावे ॥

 Therefore the convention only reveals the fixed relationship that exists between the word Om and the meaning Ïśvara, like the fixed relationship between a father and his son. Since it depends on convention as the means, the meaning is not understood on a first hearing. This is like the eye (not seeing) in the absence of light.

 ननु च शब्दानित्यत्वपक्षे कथमनित्ये संबन्धिनि नित्यः संबन्ध इति । न ह्यनित्ययो रज्जुघटयोः संबन्धो नित्यः स्यात् । उच्यते—यथा प्रमाणप्रमेययोरिन्द्रियविषययोश्च क्रियाकारकाणां संबन्धः स्थित एवानित्येष्वपि संबन्धिषु, तद्वदत्रापि स्थित एवाव्यभिचारेण संबन्धः सर्गादिष्वपि वाच्यवाचकशक्त्यपेक्षः सङ्केतः ॥

 Objection—But then, if words are not eternal then how can there be a relationship which is eternal when (one of) the related is not permanent. For instance, the relationship between the non-eternal rope and a pot is not eternal.

 Answer—Between the means of true knowledge and the known object, and between the sense-organs and their objects, there is a fixed relationship of action and what brings about the action, though the related things themselves are not eternal.So here also the relationship is fixed without any exception-"sargādiṣvapi vācyavācakaśaktyapekṣaḥ sanketaḥ[^665]"(Even in other creations usage is with reference to the power of the relation between denoter and denoted).

[^665]: "The reading in all available texts is "

 यथैव रूपचक्षुषोर्ग्राह्यग्राहकशक्त्यपेक्षयैव सर्गादौ सर्गस्तथेहापि वाच्यवाचकशक्त्यपेक्षयैव सङ्केतः क्रियते ॥

Just as there is the creation of form (shape, colour and eyes) at the beginning of creation, depending on the power of being known and being the knower, so is the case here also. The conventional usage is established on the basis of the power of being the denoted and being the denoter.

 “saṃpratipattinityatā” = by tradition,through the relationship of indicator and indicated,there is permanency of similar usage and not otherwise; thus do “āgāminaḥ" = those well versed in the scriptures "pratijānate" = know. And similar usage is the basis (cause) for the relationship between word and its meaning - so they say.

तदेतदुक्तं भवति—यद्यागमिपक्षः स्यादथान्यपक्षः, सर्वथा स्थित एव संबन्धः पितापुत्रयोरिव सङ्केतेनाभिव्यज्यत इति॥

 वाच्यवाचकयोरस्थितसंबन्धत्वे तु प्रणवरूपेणाभिमुखीभवतीश्वर इति नावकल्पते।न हि पाच्यपाचकसंबन्धे न च स्थिते पाचकाग्न्युपादानं पाकार्थं कल्पते।स्थिते तु वाच्यवाचकसंबन्धे भगवदाराधनसाधनस्य प्रणवस्योपादानमवकल्पत इति तत्प्रतिपादनार्थं सर्वं भाष्यम् ॥२७॥

 Thus it is said that the relationship is fixed for all times like that between father and son, (and) whether it is the opinion of the traditionalists or the opinion of others,convention (usage) only reveals it (this relationship).

 If the relationship between the denoter and the denoted were not fixed then Īśvara would not be seen directly through the form of Praṇava (Om). Similarly if the relationship between that which is cooked and what cooks it, is not fixed, then the employment of fire which cooks for the sake of cooking (food) will not be proper. But when the relationship between the denoted and the denoter is fixed, then the use of ‘pranava' as the means to worship God stands to reason - thus the whole commentary is to indicate this (relationship).

 विज्ञातवाच्यवाचकत्वस्य योगिनः

 By the yogi who has realized the relation between the word and its meaning—

तज्जपस्तदर्थभावनम्॥२८॥

 The repetition of it (Om) and meditating on Īśvara, which is its meaning, (should be done).

  प्रणवस्य जपः, प्रणवाभिधेयस्य चेश्वरस्य भावनम् । तदस्य योगिनः प्रणवं जपतः प्रणवार्थं च भावयतः चित्तमेकाग्रं सम्पद्यते।  
तथा चोक्तम्—

“स्वाध्यायाद्योगमासीत योगात् स्वाध्यायमामनेत्।  
स्वाध्याययोगसम्पत्त्या परमात्मा प्रकाशते॥” इति॥२८॥

 The repetition of Om and meditation on Īśvara who is denoted by 'Om' (is enjoined).Then, in the case of a yogī, who thus repeats Om and meditates on Īśvara



who is the meaning of 'Om', his mind becomes one-pointed. It has been said thus—'After the repetition of Om let him meditate on Īśvara. After meditation on Īśvara let him repeat Om. Through attainment of perfection in both the repetition of Om and in meditating on Īśvara, the Supreme Self shines forth.' (Viṣ. P.) (The meanings of ‘svādhyāya,' and 'yoga' given here follow the meanings in the Viṣ. P.)

 एवमवगतवाच्यवाचकसंबन्धस्य योगिनः परमेश्वरप्रसादनं कथं क्रियत इति तदर्थमाह—तज्जपस्तदर्थभावनम् तस्येश्वरवाचकस्य प्रणवस्यार्धचतुर्मात्रस्य त्रिमात्रस्य वा जपः मनसोपांशु वा आवर्तनं जपः,तदर्थस्य चेश्वरस्य प्रणवेन वाचकेन समर्पितस्य बुद्धौ समारोपितस्य भावनमभिध्यानं तदर्थभावनम्। कर्तव्यमिति वाक्यशेषः॥

 How do the yogīs worship Parameśvara having known in this way, the relationship between the denoted and the denoter, (Īśvara & Om). Thus he says *tajjapastadarthabhāvanam* i.e.,the repetition of Om of three and a half syllables or three syllables,which is the denoter of Īśvara; this repetition is either mental or in a low voice; *tadarthabhāvanam* i.e., the meditation of one who has the idea of Īśvara fixed in the mind brought about by the word Om which denotes Īśvara. This is to be done, should be added in order to complete the sense.

 तदेवमुभयं कुर्वतो योगिनः चित्तमेकाग्रं सम्पद्यते।एकाग्रसम्पत्तिं च तदाराधनफलं दर्शयति—तथा चोक्तम्— स्वाध्यायाद्योगमा(तिष्ठेत्)सीत स्वाध्यायात् प्रणवजपादीश्वरं प्रत्यवनतचित्तः सन् योगमासीत।तदर्थमीश्वरं ध्यायेत्। (रस्ययत्)तदर्थध्यानाच्चाप्रचलितमनाः स्वाध्यायं प्रणवमामनेत् मनसाऽभिजपेत्। मानसोऽभिजपः प्रशस्यते ध्यानस्यासन्नतरत्वात्। मा विषयप्रवणचित्तो भूदिति। एवं स्वाध्याययोगसम्पत्त्या तद्विरोधिना प्रत्ययान्तरेणानभिघातः स्वाध्याययोगसम्पत्तिः। तथा च प्रणवजपपरमेश्वरध्यानसम्पत्त्या पर आत्मा परमेष्ठी प्रकाशते योगिन इति॥२८॥

 The yogīwho does both these (practices) achieves one-pointedness of the mind. He points out how the achievement of one-pointedness is the result of that practice (through the words) “tathā coktam svādhyāyādyogamāsīta” and so on.“Svādhyāyāt” = by repetition of Om he has his mind turned towards Īśvara, “yogamāsīta” = (and) he meditates, i.e., he meditates on the meaning of Om i.e.,Īśvara. By meditating on its meaning with a steady (unwavering) mind “svādhyāyamāmanet"= he should repeat Om mentally. Mental repetition is praised, as it is closer to [meditation](http://# "Closer, in the sense that it gives rise to one-pointed meditation faster than loud repetition of Praṇava."). The idea is that the mind should not run towards outward objects.

 Thus "svādhyāyayogasampattyā" = it is perfection of the repetition of Om and achievement of one-pointedness which is not obstructed by any opposing thought. Thus by the repetition of Om and by the achievement of one-pointedness in [Īśvara](http://# "The meaning of ‘svādhyāya' and 'yoga' are repetition of Om and one-pointed meditation on Īśvara. These meanings are given in the Viṣṇu Purāṇa and are followed here. Cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. I, pp. 160 ff.")“para ātmā prakāśate" = the Supreme Ātman shines forth in the case of the yogī.  
**———————————————————————————————————————**

¹The reading available is "...svādhyāyamāste " but the Vivaraṇakāra has the the reading "...svādhyāyamāmanet".



 किं चास्य भवति।

 What else comes to him? Yogasūtrabhāṣyavivaraṇ Śaṅkara

ततः प्रत्यक्चेतनाधिगमोऽप्यन्तरायाभावश्च॥२९॥

 Due to that (Īśvarapraṇidhāna) there is an absence of obstacles and a direct perception of the inner self (pratyakcetanā).

 ये तावदन्तराया व्याधिप्रभृतयः,ते तावदीश्वरप्रणिधानान्न भवन्ति। स्वरूपदर्शनमप्यस्य भवति। यथैवेश्वरः पुरुषः शुद्धः प्रसन्नः केवलोऽनुपसर्गः,तथा अयमपि बुद्वेः प्रतिसंवेदी यः पुरुषस्तमधिगच्छति॥२९॥

 Whatever obstacles there are such as sickness &c., they disappear by devotion to Īśvara. He also obtains a perception of his true self.

 Just as Īśvara is a (special) puruṣa, pure, free from afflictions, isolated, without any change, similarly he (one who is devoted to Īśvara) sees this Self also as a puruṣa who is the knower by reflection of the (modification of the) intellect.

 किञ्चास्य भवति ? पूर्वसूत्रे चित्तमेकाग्रं सम्पद्यत इत्युक्तमेकं फलम्,तदेपक्षया किञ्चेति चकारः। किञ्चान्यदप्यस्ति फलम्? आहोस्विच्चित्तैकाग्रत्वमेवेति, तत्राह — ततः प्रत्यक्चेतनाधिगमोऽप्यन्तरायाभावश्च। ततः तस्मादीश्वरप्रणिधानात् प्रत्यक्चेतनाधिगमः प्रत्यक् स्वबुद्धिं चेतयत इति प्रत्यक्चेतन आत्मा, तस्य अधिगमो यथावत्स्वरूपसंवेदनम्॥

 "kiñcāsya bhavati". In the previous sūtra one of the results was mentioned as achievement of one-pointedness of the mind. The word “ca” in “kiñca” has been used with reference to this [(result).](http://# "'Is there something else or is this the only result. That is the significance of the word 'ca' in 'kiñca'.")Is there any other result also or is one-pointedness the only result. Thus he says *tataḥ pratyakcetanādhigamo' pyantarāyābhāvaśca.*

* tataḥ*= through devotion to Iśvara;*ratyakcetanādhigamaḥ*= that which perceives its own consciousness, thus the inner self (ātman) is *pratyakcetana* and the *adhigamaḥ*= (gaining) of that perception is *pratyakcetanādhigamaḥ*= the perception (by reflection) of its true nature as it really is.

 ननु चाधिगत एव प्रत्यात्मं पुरुषोऽहं सुखी दुःखी चाहमिति।एवं प्रसिद्धं ततः किं विशेषेणोच्यते इति। सत्यमेवम्—किं त्वविशिष्टोऽसौ प्रत्ययश्चित्तस्य वृत्त्या।किञ्च—सुखी दुःखी चाहमिति सुखिदुःखिसामानाधिकरण्यादिहाहंप्रत्ययस्य चित्तवृत्तिविषयत्वादविद्याप्रत्यय एव प्रसिद्धिः॥

 Objection — But then, puruṣa is already a matter of experience of everyone as (is clear in the statement) 'I am happy' and 'I am sad'. This is well-known; so why is it specially mentioned?

 Answer—That is true. But this modification is not different from the mind's [modification](http://# "'Worldly knowledge takes place by this identity. Thus, in fact, it is ignorance and is not the direct perception of the nature of the self.").
Moreover, in statements like 'I am happy' and 'I am sad', the common support of the thought of ‘I’ in both ‘happy' and 'sad' is an object of the modification of the mind; thus it is only a thought due to ignorance.



 कथं तर्ह्यस्याधिगम इत्याह—यथैवेश्वरः पुरुषः शुद्धः क्लेशादिमलवर्जितस्तत एव प्रसन्नः स्वच्छस्तत एव केवलो निस्त्रिगुणस्तत एव निरुपसर्गस्तापत्रयवर्जितः प्रकृष्टसत्त्वप्रतिसंवेदी च तथाऽयमपि मदीयः पुरुषः शुद्धः प्रसन्नः केवलो निरुपसर्गो बुद्धेः प्रतिसंवेदीत्यवगच्छति॥

 What is this (nature of) direct perception? He says (in answer) “yathaiveśvarah puruṣaḥśuddhaḥ" = being free from taints like afflictions, etc., [Īśvara](http://# "'kleśa, karma, āśaya, and vipāka.") is “prasannaḥ= pure and is therefore "kevalaḥ" = isolated (alone) without the three guṇas; and because of that "nirupasargaḥ" = he is free from the three kinds of [suffering](http://# "Cf. YS, II.15.") and he is one who knows by reflection the supreme [intellect](http://# "prakṛṣṭa-sattva stands for the mind ofĪśvara which is pure-sattva."). Similarly, “tathāyamapi"= my puruṣa is pure,free from taints,alone,without the three kinds of suffering and ["buddheḥpratisaṃvedītyavagacchati"](http://# "Other commentators like Miśra and Bhikṣu explain buddheḥ pratisaṃvedī only in connection with the jīva and not in connection with Īśvara. In fact Bhikṣu specifically states that this difference is mentioned in order to reject the idea of absolute identity between jīvātmā and brahman (Īśvara).Cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. II, p. 171.") is the knower by reflection of the intellect.

 यथा तथेति च दृष्टान्तदार्ष्टान्तिकनिर्देशादीश्वरक्षेत्रज्ञयोर्भेद उक्तो भवति। बद्धमुक्तोपपत्तेश्च। प्रधानस्य पारार्थ्योपपत्तेः। क्षेत्रज्ञानां चात एव परस्परभेदः॥

 किञ्चास्य भवति? ये तावदन्तराया व्याधिप्रभृतयो वक्ष्यमाणास्तेऽपि चास्येश्वरप्रणिधानान्न भवन्ति॥२९॥

 By the use of the words “yathā” and “tathā” which indicate an example and something like that example, the difference between Īśvara and Jīva has been mentioned. This is so, as it is subject to bondage and release, as it is served by [pradhāna](http://# "The jīva (individual puruṣa) is subject to bondage and release whereas Īśvara is ever - free."); it is also because of this that puruṣas differ amongst

[themselves](http://# "Bondage and release is achieved through pradhāna—thus pradhāna serves puruṣa.")."

 “kiñcāsya bhavati”; “ye tāvadantarāyā vyādhiprabhṛtayaḥ" = the obstacles such as sickness, etc., which will be [mentioned,](http://# "One puruṣa's release is not every puruṣa's release.") they also disappear due to devotion to Īśvara.

 अथ केऽन्तरायाः? ये चित्तस्य विक्षेपाः, के पुनस्ते कियन्तो वेति?

 Now what are the obstacles? These which are the distractions of the mind, what are these (distractions) and how many are there

**व्याधिस्त्यानसंशयप्रमादालस्याविरतिभ्रान्तिदर्शनालब्धभूमिकत्वानवस्थितत्वानि चित्तविक्षेपास्तेऽन्तरायाः॥३०॥**

 The distractions of the mind are sickness,idleness, doubt,negligence, sloth,lack of detachment, misapprehension, failure to attain any stage (of concentration) (and)

**—————————————————————————————————————————————**

That is the significance of the word 'kevala"; he is no more associated with the mind, an evolute of the three gunas.



inability to stay (in the stage of concentration attained); these (distractions) are the obstacles.

 नवान्तरायश्चित्तस्य विक्षेपाः। सहैते चित्तवृत्तिभिर्भवन्ति। एतेषामभावे न भवन्तिपूर्वोक्ताश्चित्तवृत्तयः। व्याधिः धातुरसकरणवैषम्यम्। स्त्यानम् अकर्मण्यता चित्तस्य। संशयः उभयकोटिस्पृक् विज्ञानम् 'स्यादिदमेवं नैवं स्यात्' इति। प्रसादः समाधिसाधनानामभावनम्। आलस्यं कायस्य चित्तस्य च गुरुत्वादप्रवृत्तिः। अविरतिः चित्तस्य विषयसम्प्रयोगात्मा गर्धः।

There are nine obstacles which are the distractions of the mind. These occur along with the modifications of the mind. In their absence the above said modifications of the mind do not take place.

 Amongst them sickness is an imbalance in the humours or in the secretions or in the organs of the body. Idleness is the inactivity of the mind. Doubt is a kind of thinking which touches two sides of a question like 'this might be so (or it) might not be so'. Negligence is lack of dedicated practice of the means to concentration.

 Sloth is the inactivity of the body and mind due to heaviness.Lack of detachment is the greed of the mind; it is of the nature of attachment to worldly objects. Erroneous perception is misapprehension. Failure to attain any stage is not attaining any stage of concentration.

 Inability to stay is the failure of the mind to stay in the stage (of concentration) attained. Only when (true) concentration is attained will the mind be steady.

 These nine distractions of the mind are known as impurities of yoga, foes of yoga (and) obstacles to yoga.

 तत्र के तेऽन्तरायाः? कियन्तो वेत्याह—व्याधिस्त्यानेत्यादि। संख्यया तावन्नवान्तरायाः।स्वरूपेण च व्याध्यादयः। व्याधिर्धातुरसकरणवैषम्यम्। धातवो वातपित्तश्लेष्माणस्तेषां विषमभावो वैषम्यं,तच्च वातपित्तश्लेष्मभूयिष्ठद्रव्योपयोगादिभ्यो जायते। स्वयान्यागमे हि धातूनां वृद्धिमाचक्षते॥

 In that context,what are the obstacles and ['how many are they.'](http://# "'The reading in available texts is 'ke te'ntarāyāh.'") He says *vyādhistyāna* and so on. Numerically there are nine obstacles and in essence they are sickness and so on. vyādhiḥ= the imbalance in the [humours](http://# "they are three i.e..vāta,pita,kapha i.e., air,bile and phlegm.")or in the [secretions](http://# "The fluids are what the food consumed is converted into.") or in the [organs of the body,](http://# "The gross and subtle organs of action.") is [sickness.](http://# "The three are also connected. Any disorder in the three humours gives rise to the upset in the fluids which in turn can lead to disorder in the sense-organs of action.")The humours are air, bile and phlegm and the loss of harmony in them is an imbalance; this comes into being due to the use of substances having an excess of air, bile and [phlegm.](http://# "This is an interesting observation drawing one's attention to a person's lifestyle.") The humours are said to be in excess either by itself or by [something else.](http://# "Increase can be by itself or due to some outside substance like food, etc.")



 रस उपयुक्ताहारस्य परिणामविशेषः।स च सप्तधा,रसकार्यत्वाद्रस इत्युच्यते रसलोहितमेदोमांसास्थिमज्जाशुक्लाख्यः।तस्य वैषम्यं वृद्धिक्षयौ। करणवैषम्यमन्धबधिरत्वादि॥

 स्त्यानमकर्मण्यता चित्तस्य स्तिमितम्। संशयः स्थाणुर्वा पुरुषो वेति विरुद्धोभयकोटिस्पृक् प्रत्ययः॥

 The fluids are the special transformation of the food eaten. And that is of seven kinds; they are called fluids as they are the effects (of food). They are called rasa (essence), blood, fat, flesh, bone, marrow and semen. Their imbalance is due to increase or decrease in [them](http://# "Measured against a standard, increase or decrease in that standard is an imbalance.").

 Disorder in the organs of action is like blindness, deafness and so on.

* styānam* is idleness of the mind, a numbness, saṃśayaḥ is a thought which touches two sides of a question which are opposed to each other like the statement 'Is it a man or a pillar'.

 प्रमादः समाधिसाधनानामभावनमशीलनम्।आलस्यं कायस्य चित्तस्य च गुरुत्वादप्रवर्तनम्।अविरतिश्चित्तस्य विषयसम्प्रयोगस्वभावो विषयसम्प्रयोगनिमित्तो वा गर्द्धः अभिकाङ्क्षा तृष्णा॥

 भ्रान्तिदर्शनं विपर्ययज्ञानं योगसाधनेषु तन्मार्गे वा विपरीतवृत्तिः। अलब्धभूमिकत्वं समाधिभूमेरलाभः। भूमयो वितर्कादयश्चित्तस्य धर्मविशेषा उक्ता वक्ष्यमाणाश्च। अनवस्थितायामपि समाधिभूमौ ततः कथमपि प्रचलितस्य चित्तस्य पुनस्तत्रावस्थितत्वमेव स्यात्तदलाभस्त्वनवस्थितत्वमुच्यते॥

* pramādaḥ* is lack of devotion to the means to samādhi; lack of dedicated practice. *ālasyam* is the inactivity of the body and mind due to heaviness.

* aviratiḥ* is the nature of the mind's attachment to objects of the senses or the desire or greed caused by contact with objects of the [senses](http://# "This is the memory of past experience.").

* bhrāntidarśanam* is misapprehension, it is wrong understanding opposed to the means of yoga or the path of yoga itself.

* alabdhabhūmikatvam* is not achieving the state of [samādhi](http://# "The Vivaraṇakāra very often uses the same explanations as the Vyāsabhāṣya, without adding much of his own commentary. This is clearly seen in this explanation.").The stages (of samādhi) are vitarka and so on, which have been mentioned as the special characteristics of the [mind](http://# "Cf. YS, I.17.") and will be mentioned (as such) later, [also](http://# "YS, I.41–48. Cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. I, pp. 206 ff.").

  Though there is the inability to stay in the stage of samādhi attained, one should try and fix the mind which is wandering, again to the same stage; when that is not achieved it is called *anavasthitattvam.*

 तदेते नवान्तरायाः।अन्तरं विवरं विच्छेदं कुर्वन्त आयान्तीत्यन्तरायाः विक्षेपाः,प्रतिपक्षाः योगप्राप्तेरुपसर्गाः।एते च सह चित्तवृत्तिभिर्भवन्ति।चित्तं विक्षिपन्ति विषयेष्विति चित्तविक्षेपाः।क्षिप्रं ते (क्षिपन्ति) सहैते वृत्तिभिः पञ्चतयीभिरन्योन्यप्रयोज्यप्रयोजकभावेन भवन्ति।अथैषामभावे व्याधिप्रभृतीनामभावे सहायबलाभावान्न भवन्ति पूर्वोक्ताः प्रमाणादयश्चित्तवृत्तयः। तद्भावभावित्वात्तुल्यप्रत्यनीका वृत्तिविक्षेपा इत्युक्तं भवति ॥३०॥

 These are the nine obstacles.They are obstacles (*antarāya*) as they cause an opening,a fissure,a break. They are distractions,opponents, enemies to the attainment of yoga.



“ete ca saha [cittavṛttibhirbhavanti](http://# "The Vivaraṇakāra has ‘ete ca saha cittavṛtti . . .' instead of 'sahaite cittavṛttibhirbhavanti'")". They are "cittavikṣepāḥ” because they distract the mind through various objects. And they appear simultaneously along with the [fivefold](http://# "YS, I.6. pramāṇa, viparyaya, etc.")modifications of the mind having a mutual relationship of director and [directed.](http://# "Through this relationship they function.")Thus in their absence, [“eṣāmabhāve"](http://# "The reading is ‘eteṣāmabhāve' not ‘eṣāmabhāve'.")i.e, in the absence of sickness, etc., in the absence of their help, the above-mentioned modifications like true knowledge and so on, do not occur.

 The distractions in the form of modifications (of the mind) are considered enemies because they create the same processes in the mind.

दुःखदौर्मनस्याङ्गमेजयत्वश्वासप्रश्वासा विक्षेपसहभुवः॥३१॥

 Pain, dejection, unsteadiness of the body, inhaling and exhaling exist along with distractions.

 दुःखम् आध्यात्मिकमाधिभौतिकमाधिदैविकं च।येनाभिहताः प्राणिनः तदपघाताय प्रयतन्ते तदुःखम्।दौर्मनस्यम् इच्छाविघाताच्चेतसः क्षोभः।यदङ्गान्येजयति कम्पयति तदङ्गमेजयत्वम्।प्राणो यद्बाह्यं वायुमाचामति स श्वासः।यत्कौष्ठ्यं वायुं निस्सारयति स प्रश्वासः।एते विक्षेपसहभुवः। विक्षिप्तचित्तस्यैते भवन्ति।समाहितचित्तस्यैते न भवन्ति।अथैते विक्षेपाः समाधिप्रतिपक्षाः ताभ्यामेवाभ्यासवैराग्याभ्यां निरोद्धव्याः॥३१॥

Pain is (of three kinds ) – arising from the self, arising from living creatures and arising from the gods. Pain is that by which living beings are overcome and for the destruction of which they strive.

 Dejection is the agitation of the mind due to the non-fulfilment of (its) desire. Unsteadiness of the body is that which makes it unsteady, makes it tremble. Inhaling is breathing which is the sipping in of outiside air, exhaling is that which makes the air in the abdomen flow outwards.

 These exist along with distractions. These are present in one whose mind is distracted. These are not present in one whose mind is concentrated.

 Thus these distractions are the foes of concentration, they are to be restricted by the same practice and detachment, (already mentioned in I. 12).

 दुःखं येनाभिहताः प्राणिनस्तदपघाताय प्रयतन्ते चेष्टन्ते। तच्च त्रिविधम्।आध्यात्मिकम्,अधि आत्मनीत्यध्यात्मम्,तत्र भवमाध्यात्मिकम्।तच्च शारीरं मानसं च।शारीरं धातुवैषम्यादिनिमित्तम्। मानसमिष्टविघातादिहेतुकम्।आधिभौतिकम् अधि भूतेष्वित्यधिभूतम्,तत्र भवमाधिभौतिकम्।तच्च पशुमृगाद्युपनिपतितम्।आधिदैविकमिति अधि देवेष्वित्यधिदेवम्,तत्र भवमाधिदैविकम्।'अध्यात्मादिभ्यष्ठक्' इत्युपसंख्यानात् ठक्।अनुशतिकादित्वादुभयपदवृद्धिः।तच्चापि वातवर्षादिनिमित्तम्। तदेकमेव सन्निमित्तभेदेन रजोरूपं भिद्यते॥

* duḥkha* (pain) is that by which living beings are overcome and for the destruction .



of which they strive. And that is of three kinds. "ādhyātmikam" = that which pertains to the self is adhyātmam and that which arises from that is "adhyātmikam". And that (pain) is bodily and mental. Bodily (pain) is due to imbalance in the humours. Mental (pain) is caused by non-fulfilment of desires.

 "ādhibhautikam" = that which pertains to living beings is adhibhūtam and that which arises from that is "ādhibhautikam". And it is what comes about from cows, deer, etc.

 "ādhidaivikam" = that which pertains to divine beings is adhidevam and that which arises from that is "ādhidaivikam". In all these cases the affix 'ṭhak' has been added by the rule ['adhyātmādibhyaṣṭhak'.](http://# "Supplement to Pān. Aṣṭā., IV.4.1-76.") The lengthening of the vowel in both the [parts](http://# "adhi and bhūta, adhi and deva and so on.")is due to the rule ['anuśatikādīnām ca'.](http://# "Pāṇ. Aṣṭa., VII.3.27.")And that (adhidaivikam) is caused by wind, rain, etc.

 Being [one](http://# "Pain is only one but known differently due to different reasons like bodily pain, etc.")of the nature of rajas, it is divided variously under different causes.

*
[daurmanasyam](http://# "The Vivaraṇakāra has nothing new to add to these definitions and repeats what the Vyāsabhāṣya says. Only that which is not given in the bhāṣya is translated in this passage as the commentary of Vyāsa is available there itself."),* frustration (of the mind), agitation. "yad...tad angamejayatvam".*śvāsaḥ* = breathing in the outside air in deep gasps and breathing it out slowly. *praśvāsaḥ* is the opposite of that ([*śvāsaḥ*](http://# "The definition being the same as Vyāsa's.")). These "vikṣepasahabhuvaḥ" = exist along with the distractions and belong to the distracted mind.

 To the extent that the mind is concentrated, to that extent they do not [occur.](http://# "It is only in a mind that is not concentrated that distractions occur.")"tābhyāmevābhyāsavairāgyābhyām niroddhavyaḥ"i.e.,they are to be restricted by the two-constant practice (of samadhi) and detachment.They do not respond to any other counter-measure.

 It follows that without constant practice and detachment the devotees of Īśvara have no power ([to attain samādhi](http://# "It appears that there was a school which did not allow devotion to Īśvara as an independent means to samadhi but combined it with constant practice and detachment.")). By the statement [*antarāyābhāvaśca*](http://# "YS, 1.29.")it means that the obstacles are restricted even by the previous (mentioned) devotion to [Īśvara.](http://# "This seems to be a compromise to the bhakti concept.")



 तत्राभ्यासस्य विषयमुपसंहरन् इदमाह—

 In that connection, concluding the topic on practice, he says this.

तत्प्रतिषेधार्थमेकतत्त्वाभ्यासः॥३२॥

 In order to remove these (there should be) practice on a single entity.

 विक्षेपप्रतिषेधार्थमेकतत्त्वालम्बनं चित्तमभ्यसेत्।

 यस्य तु प्रत्यर्थनियतं प्रत्ययमात्रं क्षणिकं च चित्तं तस्य सर्वमेव चित्तमेकाग्रम्। नास्त्येव विक्षिप्तम्।

 यदि पुनरिदं सर्वतः प्रत्याहृत्य एकस्मिन्नर्थंसमाधीयते, तदा भवत्येकाग्रमित्यतो न प्रत्यर्थनियतम्।

 In order to remove distractions, (the yogī) should practise concentrating the mind on a single entity as support.

 According to the (Buddhists) (who say that ) the mind is momentary, it is nothing more than an idea and it is limited to one object (at one moment) the entire mind is one-pointed and there is no distracted (mind).

 But when this (mind) is withdrawn from all (objects) and is concentrated upon one object then it is one-pointed; therefore (it is) not limited to one object (as the Buddhist says).

 योऽपि सदृशप्रत्ययप्रवाहेण चित्तमेकाग्रं मन्यते, तस्य एकाग्रता यदि प्रवाहचित्तस्य धर्मः,तदा एकं नास्ति प्रवाहचित्तम्; क्षणिकत्वात्।

 अथ प्रवाह्यंशस्यैव प्रत्ययस्य धर्मः,स सर्वः,सदृशप्रत्ययप्रवाही वा विसदृशप्रत्ययप्रवाही वा प्रत्यर्थनियतत्वादेकाग्र एवेति विक्षिप्तचित्तानुपपत्तिः। तस्मादेकमनेकार्थमवस्थितं चित्तमिति॥

 If, on the other hand, the mind is considered one-pointed due to the flow of similar ideas then, if the one-pointedness of it (the mind) is the quality of the flow of the mind, then there is no single flow of the mind because of the momentariness (of the mind).

 If, however, it (one-pointedness) is a quality of the idea which is a part of the flow (of ideas) then whether all (ideas) are a flow of similar ideas or a flow of dissimilar ideas, because each flow is limited to one idea, it is only one-pointed; therefore (there is) the absence of distracted mind (in their view, which can be made one-pointed).

 Therefore, it can be said that the mind is one, it is (the support of) many objects (and) is stable.

 यदि च चित्तेनैकेनानन्विताः स्वभावभिन्नाः प्रत्यया जायेरन्,अथ कथमन्यप्रत्ययदृष्टस्यान्यः स्मर्ता भवेत्,अन्यप्रत्ययोपचितस्य च कर्माशयस्यान्यः प्रत्यय उपभोक्ता भवेत्॥

 कथञ्चित् समाधीयमानमप्येतत् गोमयपायसीयन्यायमाक्षिपति।

 Moreover,if through the one mind, ideas unrelated (to each other) and different in nature (at every moment) were produced, then how can one idea (mind) remember the idea seen by another idea (mind). And another mind would be the experiencer of the deposit of the subliminal-impressions of karma accumulated by another mind.

 Even if the situation is somehow explained this (reasoning) would be worse than the reasoning that cow-dung is a milky preparation (because it comes from the cow, like milk).



 किंच—स्वात्मानुभवापह्नवः चित्तस्यान्यत्वे प्राप्नोति।कथम्? 'यदहमद्राक्षं तत्स्पृशामि' 'यच्चास्प्राक्षं तत्पश्यामि' इत्यहमिति प्रत्ययः सर्वस्य प्रत्ययस्य भेदे सति प्रत्यायिन्यभेदेनोपस्थितः।एकप्रत्ययिविषयोऽयमभेदात्मा अहमिति प्रत्ययः कथमत्यन्तभिन्नेषु चित्तेषु वर्तमानः सामान्यमेकं प्रत्ययिनमाश्रयेत। स्वानुभवग्राह्यश्चायमभेदात्मा अहमिति प्रत्ययः।

 Moreover, if the mind is one idea after another then there is the denial of one's own experience. How (is that)? 'That which I saw I touch and that which I touched I see' thus this idea of I, even when all the ideas are different, is present, without change, in the mind (seer). How could this idea 'I am the self which is not different' which has a single idea (I) as its object and which is present in ideas which are totally different, reside in one general mind (seer).

 This idea that ‘I am the self which is not different' is knowable in one's own experience.

 Moreover the superiority of perception is not overthrown by another source of valid knowledge. In fact any other source of valid knowledge comes into usage only by the power of perception. Therefore (it is established that) the mind is one, it is (the support of) many objects and it is stable.

 Of what nature is this purification which is enjoined by the authoritative texts on one whose mind has attained stability?

अभ्यासवैराग्याभ्यां तन्निरोध इत्युक्तम्।तत्र वैराग्यविषयः प्रतिपादितः।इदानीमभ्यासस्य विषयमुपसंहरन्नाह— तत्प्रतिषेधार्थमेकतत्त्वाभ्यास इति। तेषां विक्षेपाणां प्रतिषेधाय तत्प्रतिषेधार्थम्। एकं तत्त्वमेकतत्त्वम्। तच्चैकं तत्त्वं वस्तुत्वानाभ्यसितुं शक्यम्। न ह्यात्मादिवस्तूनां शीलनं वक्तुं शक्यते। स्वमाहाभाग्यावस्थितानि हि तानि न चित्तमात्राणि। वस्तूनां तु चित्ततन्त्रतां प्रतिषेधयिष्यत—'न चैकचित्ततन्त्रं वस्तु' इत्यादिना। तस्मादेतदाशङ्कमानो भाष्यकार आह—एकतत्त्वालम्बनं चित्तमभ्यसेदिति। सूत्रेऽप्येकतत्त्वाभ्यास इति समासादयमर्थ उपात्त एव॥

 It has been [said](http://# "YS, 1.12.") that their restriction is through practice and detachment. In that context, the object of detachment has been [mentioned.](http://# "YS, 1.15.")Now concluding the topic on practice he says *tatpratiṣedhārthamekatattvābhyāsaḥ.*

* tatpratiṣedhārtham* = for the sake of removing those distractions *ekatattvam* = one entity.

 Objection—That one principle being a reality is not capable of being the object of meditation. One cannot even speak of the nature of real entities like ātman, for instance.They are established in their own greatness and they are not just mental objects. It will be denied later that the objects have dependence on the mind by the sūtra, *An object is not dependent on one [mind.](http://# "YS, IV.16.")*

 Answer—With this doubt in mind the commentator says "ekatattvālaṃbanam[cittamabhyaset".](http://# "In available texts the reading is ".....ekatattvālaṁbanam",whereas the Vivaranakāra has the reading" "..ekatattvālaṁbanam".")In the sūtra also this is the meaning obtained by the compound *ekatattvābhyāsa.*



 ननु नैकं चित्तमवस्थितमस्ति, यस्यैकतत्त्वावलम्बनः प्रत्यय आपद्येत।प्रत्यया एव चित्तम्,ते च प्रत्यर्थं नियताः क्षणप्रणाशिनश्च। प्रत्यात्मसंवेद्यं च प्रत्ययानामनवस्थितत्वम्। नापि प्रत्ययव्यतिरेकेणावस्थितं प्रत्यय चित्तं नामोपलभ्यते। योऽप्यहमेवाहमिति प्रत्ययः सोऽपि समानसन्ततिपतितत्त्वात्सादृश्यनिबन्धनः। यथा स एव प्रदीपः त एव केशा इति॥

 Objection—But then, there is no one mind that is always existing which can have an idea based on a single principle as [support.](http://# "'The Buddhist idea that the mind itself is momentary, it is nothing more than an idea, it is limited to one object at one moment, is being mentioned by the opponent.") The mind is the ideas themselves and they are each limited to a single object (in each moment) and perishing every moment. There is no enduring entity in the ideas which are each known by a single mind (ātman). Nor is there a mind known which exists apart from the ideas as their knower. The idea of I as 'I' is one among the flow of such similar ideas and has a relation of similarity. It is like saying that the lamp-flame is but the hairs (of the wick of the lamp).

तदप्याह—प्रत्यहं\[प्रति\] प्रत्ययं प्रत्ययो भिन्नः,प्रत्ययेभ्योऽत्यन्तपरस्परभिन्नेभ्योऽनन्यत्वात्। एकैकप्रत्ययस्वरूपसद्वर्तमानाहंप्रत्ययविषयः प्रत्ययी भूतभविष्यत्कालाहंप्रत्ययविषयात् प्रत्ययनो भिन्नः,भिन्नप्रत्ययविषयत्वात्,घटात् (घ) पट इव।यदि वा—भिन्नकालत्वात्, विनष्टभविष्यद्धटाभ्यां वर्तमानो घटः (इव)। अहंप्रत्यया वा सर्वे भिन्नालम्बनाः, प्रत्ययत्वात्, घटपटादिविषयप्रत्ययवदिति॥

  Answer—Then it means that with reference to each I-notion having a single idea, the possesser of the I-notions would be different as it would be identical with the ideas which are absolutely distinct from each other. The possessor of ideas has the notion of 'I' of the essence of each idea then present; it is distinct from the possessors of the I-notions in the past or the future since it has different ideas as its objects, just as the cloth differs from the pot. Or being different in time, it is like the difference of the present pot from past broken pots or from the pots not yet come into being. Or all the I-notions have different supports, being ideas, like the idea of objects like pot, cloth and so on.

 अत्राभिधीयते—स्वशास्त्रविरोधोऽपि स्यादेवं ब्रुवत इत्याह—क्षणिकं च यस्य चित्तं तस्य सर्वमेव चित्तम् एकाग्रम् विक्षेपाभावादेव नास्त्येव विक्षिप्तमिति सर्वचित्तैकाग्रत्वाद्विक्षेपप्राप्त्यभावाद्विक्षेपप्रतिषेधाय शास्त्रोपदेशोऽनर्थकः स्यात्। अस्ति च चित्तपरिकर्मार्थं मैत्र्याधुपदेशः। स च विरुध्येत इत्थंधर्मं चित्तमभ्युपगच्छतः॥

 He mentions that those who advocate this [theory](http://# "The kṣaṇikavāda of Buddhists.")are also contradicting their own doctrine (through the words) "kṣaṇikam ca yasya cittam tasya sarvameva[cittamekāgram](http://# "There is no 'yasya' in the available texts but the Vivaraṇakāra has it.")",i.e, in the absence of distractions “nāstyeva vikṣiptam" (there is no distracted mind) and the entire mind being one-pointed, there being no way for distraction, the teaching of the doctrine for removal of distraction is useless. And there is the teaching of friendliness and so [on](http://# "The vihāras, maitrī,etc., is for the sake of removal of distractions. So that becomes useless."),for the purification of the mind. That will contradict the understanding of the mind as having this [characteristic.](http://# "The quality of being momentary will contradict that teaching.")



 ननु च तवापि वृत्तिवृत्तिमतोरभेदादनुपपन्नो विक्षेप इति तत्प्रतिषेधोपदेशानर्थक्यम्—नैष दोषः—वृत्तिवृत्तिमत्त्वाभ्युपगमात्॥

 यदि वृत्तय एव परस्परभिन्नाः स्वतन्त्रा वृत्तिमतोऽत्यन्तभिन्ना जायेरन् प्रत्यर्थनियताश्च, तत एष दोषः स्यात्। न चैवमभ्युपेयते॥

 Objection—But then, even in your doctrine there is an identity between the modification (of the mind) and one who possesses the modification—thus distraction does not fit in. Therefore the teaching to remove distraction is useless (in your case as well).

 Answer—There is no defect as we accept the modification and the possessor of the [modification.](http://# "As separate entities.") If the modifications (notions) which are mutually distinct are independent and also arise distinct from the possessor of the notions and are also limited to each notion of an object, only then can this defect be [there](http://# "The defect in the non-difference of the mind as limited to the object of knowledge and its being momentary as well. This is not there is our theory says the Siddhāntin."). But we do not accept that.

 कथं तर्हि ? वृत्तिमद्रूपेणैकमनेकार्थं च तद्वृत्तीनां विषयभेदादवस्थितं च सदसतोर्विपर्ययानभ्युपगमादित्येवमात्मपक्षे समञ्जसतां दर्शयति—यदि पुनरिदं चित्तंवृत्तिभेदेनानेकधा (म्मिलावयवद्धि) प्रसृतं साङ्ख्ययोगवादिन इव तवापि सर्वतः सर्वेभ्यः विषयेभ्यः प्रत्याहृत्य प्रत्यानीयैकस्मिन्नात्माद्यर्थे समाधीयेत स्थाप्येत तदा भवत्येकाग्रं पुरुषप्रयासभाव्यत्वार्हमित्यर्थः॥

 Then what is our position? This mind having modifications in the form of one notion or many notions, due to the difference of objects of the modifications is steady, as we do not accept the misapprehension of its existence or [non-existence.](http://# "There is no doubt as to the steady presence and existence of the mind in our system says the Siddhāntin.")Thus he indicates the considered opinion of the school (through the words) "yadi punaridam sarvataḥ pratyāhṛtya ekasminnarthe samādhīyeta tadā bhavatyekāgram” = the mind when flowing out in different directions due to various modifications has to be turned back from all the (various) objects and it has to be fixed in one object like the ātman etc.; then it is one-pointed. This is as much true of [you](http://# "The Buddhist.") as of those who profess Sāṅkhya-Yoga. This is something which is to be brought about by human effort.

 ततो युक्तस्तत्परिकर्मणे शास्त्रोपदेशः।(अतो न प्रत्यक्षम्) अतोऽस्मात् कारणात् तत्परिकर्मविषयशास्त्रोपदेशात् सांख्ययोगवादिवत् क्षणिकवादिनोऽपि एकमनेकार्थमवस्थितं च चित्तं न प्रत्यर्थनियतं (वा) पश्चादभ्युपगमनीयम्।अन्यथा शास्त्रविरोधः स्यात्। योऽपि सदृशप्रत्ययप्रवाहं चित्तमेकाग्रं मन्यते सदृशः समानः प्रत्ययप्रवाहो यस्यैकस्यां सन्ततौ तच्चित्तमेकाग्रम्। तद्विपरीतम् असमानप्रत्ययप्रवाहं विक्षिप्तम्। तथा चैकाग्रता विक्षेपप्रतिषेधेनोपपद्यते, तदर्थोपदेशश्चेति कुतः शास्त्रविरोध इति॥

 Thus the teaching of the scriptures for mental purification is proper. "ato" = due to this reason i.e., due to scriptural teachings regarding mental purification, those who advocate the theory of momentariness will have to accept, like the advocates of Sāṅkhya-Yoga, that the mind is one with many objects and is steady and is not limited to each (one) object. Otherwise it will contradict the [scriptures.](http://# "The Buddhist would be contradicting his own scriptures if he does not accept this.")



 Objection—“yo pi... manyate".That which has a flow of similar ideas; i.e., the mind is one-pointed in a series of similar thoughts, and its opposite, a series of dissimilar thoughts is distraction.Thus one-pointedness is achieved by opposing distraction and the teachings advocate this; thus where is the contradiction to scriptures?

 Answer—The others say — that is not so. There is no acceptance of a single substratum for the flow of ideas of the [mind](http://# "There is no underlying unity.").He does not accept a substratum of the stream-mind which is a single thing having thoughts which are past, present and future. In case he accepts it then he would have to give up his own position. How is that? The mind-flow not being momentary, is not a single [thing](http://# "All things being momentary in the Buddhist system.") whose characteristic could be one-pointedness. [He](http://# "The Buddhist.")only accepts ideas which are mutually connected to each [other](http://# "Which follow successively one another.") like a row of red ants.

 अथैवं मन्यते,यद्यप्येकं नास्ति तथापि सर्वेषामेव प्रत्ययानां सदृशप्रवाहाणामेकाग्रता धर्मः प्रदीपार्चिषामिव प्रकाश इति—तत्राह—

 Objection—Let it be that though it is not a single thing still, there can be the quality of one-pointedness in all the ideas which are of a similar series as in the case of the illumination of all the flames of a lamp.

 Answer—There is no combination of things which come into being and are destroyed at different times. And the example given does not prove the point. The (single) illumination is not of many flames, as each flame is different from the other. It is also not the case that the illumination of the flames all have a single quality.

 अथापि मन्यते प्रवाहांशस्यैव प्रत्ययस्य कस्यचिदेकाग्रता धर्मः, यथैकस्यां पिपीलिकासन्ततावेकापि पिपीलिका लोहितेति—तच्च न—पूर्वदोषानुषक्तेः। सर्वः प्रत्ययः प्रवाहांशः सदृशवाही विसदृशवाही वा पूर्ववत् प्रत्यर्थनियतत्वादेकाग्र एवेति विक्षिप्तचित्तानवलृप्तिः। तस्मादेकमनेकार्थमवस्थितं च चित्तमभ्युपगन्तव्यम्। यदि शास्त्रेण चित्तपरिकर्मोपदेक्ष्यते॥

 Objection—It can be said that the quality of one-pointedness is that of the ideas which is a part of the flow (of ideas), as in a row of red ants every single ant is red.

 Answer—That is not so, as it will suffer from the defect already mentioned. All ideas are parts of a flow whether they are of a similar series or of a dissimilar series. Then as before, since each idea is limited to one idea it is only one-pointed and there is no distracted mind. Therefore, if the scripture teaches purification of the mind then it has to be accepted that the mind is one, it is the support of many objects and it is [stable](http://# "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add much to what has been already stated in the bhāṣya. Only a word here and there is added to complete the sense of the bhāṣya.").



 किं च—

यदि चित्तेनैकेनानन्विताः करणेन स्वभावभिन्नाः प्रत्यया जायेरंस्तदा ब्रूहि कथमन्यप्रत्ययदृष्टस्यान्यः प्रत्ययः स्मर्ता भवेद्देवदत्तदृष्टस्येव यज्ञदत्तः। अन्यप्रत्ययोपचितस्य वा कर्माशयस्यान्यः प्रत्यय उपभोक्ता॥

एवमप्यन्यत्प्रवृत्तिविज्ञानमालयविज्ञाने संस्कारं नादधीत, भिन्नत्वात्। यथा सन्तत्यन्तरालयविज्ञाने॥

 Moreover, if through the instrumentality of the single mind ideas unrelated to each other arise then please tell me how can one idea (mind) remember the idea (object) seen by another idea (mind). It will be like the case of Yajñadatta remembering what Devadatta had seen. And again, one mind would be the experiencer of the deposit of the subliminal-impressions of karma accumulated by another mind.

 It cannot be that an unborn son would enjoy heaven and so on, which is the result of the accumulated karma of his father.

 Objection—

It can be said that for the sake of the particular consciousness of the future son the active consciousness, while perishing,can endow some saṁskāra (sub-liminal-impression)in the seed-bed-consciousness.

 Answer—That is not so, since the seed-bed-consciousness and active-consciousness are absolutely different and they are also not real. If the active consciousness is not (different) from the seed-bed-consciousness then,there is only a difference in name as they are one and the same thing and there cannot be memory connected with the deposit of some subliminal-impression. If they are different, even then the active consciousness which is different cannot deposit its subliminal-impression in the seed-bed-consciousness as they are different, as much as it cannot deposit it in another flow of seed-bed-[consciousness](http://# "The reference to the ālayavijñāna of the Buddhists.").

 किंच—यद्यपि संस्कारमाधत्ताम्,तथापि प्रवृत्तिविज्ञानापादितसंस्कारमालयविज्ञानं देशकालान्तराक्षमम्।तस्यापि क्षणिकत्वाभ्युपगमाद्विनश्यच्च तावत्येव नोत्तरविज्ञानोपकाराय पर्याप्नोति। देशकालान्तरव्यवहितं चेदुपकुर्वीत,तदा भिन्नसन्तानान्तरजन्मनाप्युपकर्तव्यम्॥

अथ कालान्तरावस्थायि, तदा क्षणिकत्वहानिः। क्षणान्तरं चेदवतिष्ठेत, दीर्घकालावस्थायित्वे कस्य स्यादक्षमा॥

 Moreover,even if we accept the deposit of subliminal-impressions still the seed-bed-consciousness which is the deposit of subliminal-impressions of the active-consciousness is irrelevant to another place and time. And since that is also considered momentary it is destroyed immediately and so is not capable of helping any other consciousness. If one accepts that, even though separated by time and space it can help, then it should also be able to help to give rise to another different series.

 If it exists as it is at a different time then the theory of momentariness will be destroyed. If it exists in the next moment then why cannot it stay for a long time?

 Objection— The earlier seed-be-consciousness perishes after depositing the sub-liminal-impressions of the future seed-bed-consciousness of the particular saṃskāra of active consciousness which is similar to itself, which stays in between.

 Answer—

That is also not right since there is no other saṃskāra. And if there is one there would be an infinite regress. When there is no substratum, what is the idea of the deposit of saṃskāra by imagining a seed-bed-consciousness of the active consciousness.

 If a seed-bed-consciousness is to deposit the saṃskāra of the future seed-bed-consciousness which is to come into being in the future and is not existing at that moment then even the active consciousness can deposit the saṃskāra of the future active consciousness which is to come into being in the future and is not existing at that moment, without depending on the seed-bed-consciousness.

 There is no example of something which is perishing, depositing the saṃskāra of something else which belongs to the future and which is not existing at that moment. Nor can it create a saṃskāra in the future. To say that the future is impressed by something earlier and at the same time to say that it will come into existence in the future, is a contradiction. If the future, not in existence at that time, is to be so impressed then what is the use of imagining a similar or dissimilar series (of ideas). As there is no connection whatsoever, everything can be impressed by everything else.

 Nor can there be simultaneously the disappearance and appearance of that which perishes in the future and that which comes into being in the future, as that will mean [non-momentariness](http://# "This the Buddhists cannot agree to and it will go against their fundamental belief.").

 Objection—

Let it be like the ends of a balance where when one goes down the other comes up. Let there be simultaneously the disappearance of the earlier thing and the appearance of the later thing.



 Answer—

That cannot be as that will contradict the accepted theory. The Vaināśika does not accept any other agency apart from the action of appearance and destruction. If any other agency is accepted then it will contradict the doctrine (itself).

 Moreover, when there is a difference between the agent (of action) and action, the agent has to stay separate till such time as the production of the action but that is also against (the theory of) momentariness. And if it is an enduring substance it is meaningless to assume it for the sake of [action.](http://# "Since it is already there, no purpose is served by assuming it for the sake of action.")

क्रियाया एव कारकत्वे कारकस्यापि क्रियात्वे क्रियाकारकशब्दौ पर्यायौ स्याताम्। ततश्चाङ्कुरो जायते,देवदत्तो जायत इत्यङ्कुरदेवदत्तयोः पर्यायत्वं स्यात्। तयोर्जनिक्रियामात्रत्वात्॥

 Moreover there is something else—

When action itself is the agent and the agent is also the action both the words agent and action become synonyms. Then because one says 'A sprout is born' and 'Devadatta is born',both the sprout and Devadatta will be [synonyms](http://# "If one follows the same reasoning, this would be the result.")as in both cases there is the action of birth alone.

 Objection—

But one action of birth is qualified by Devadatta and the other is qualified by the sprout.

 Answer—

If the agent is accepted as a quality then in its own essence nothing can be [qualified.](http://# "Nothing can be its own qualifier. The difference between the quality and qualified has to be accepted.")

 Objection—

It is said that in itself one action of coming into being is different from another action of coming into being just as forms (shapes), etc.,distinguishing them are different.

 Answer —That is not so; then there will be the undesirable consequence of considering both existence and non-existence as being identical. In the following case, when one says birth and death it is of the sprout as— 'the sprout is born', 'the sprout is dead', that which is born alone dies, therefore it is the birth of the sprout and the death of the sprout. Or it is said here that the sprout is itself the action or the agent.

 Objection—

Still it can be that the action of destruction of the sprout is different from the action of the birth of thesprout.

 Answer—

Then there will be the danger of the birth of the sprout being permanent because the destruction is something separate.

 Objection— Let the object having birth and death be a mixture (a combination).

 Answer—

That will mean that there is a combination with something that does not exist. How is that? Though there is absence of any agency apart from action, destruction itself is that having birth and destruction and birth itself is that having birth and destruction.And a non-existent thing cannot have properties like combination, etc., as it is without any characteristic and it is beyond (not opposed to) both existence and [non-existence](http://# "One cannot talk of something non-existent being existent or non-existent. "), and it is not known either by direct perception or by inference.

 And the example of the rise and fall of the two ends of a balance which is stated is like this- the two ends of a balance which are present at the same time are connected; due to the weight of some other substance placed on one end there is its fall and then there is the rise of the other end. But here there is the disappearance and rise of the present and future consciousness respectively. And as in the case of the ends of a balance, without a third cause, the [two](http://# "Destruction of the present consciousness and birth of the future consciousness.")cannot happen at the same time. It cannot be said that the consciousness which is perishing gives rise to a consciousness similar to itself. To say that Devadatta while dying himself creates, by his death, in the same moment,a son just like himself is not right.

 Objection—

Then it is like a lump of clay which perishes while giving rise to a pot.

 Answer—

That is also not right. It is the parts of clay which change into the form of a pot. It is just a single entity which possesses many characteristics like a lump of clay, a pot and so on.

 The argument that in seeds which are inhabited by other substances there is the deposit of the inhabited substance in the abode-substance is also not a case of causation,as the abode and that which stays there are abiding (enduring).It is only in seeds which are stable that there are sprouts which reside in them through the seed-



impressions. As it is [different](http://# "As the sprout is different from the seed.")there are subtle parts which do not enter the abode-substance. Thus it is only proper that the existent sprouts, etc., are impressed (resided in) by the seed-impressions, as there is no coming into being of non-existent rabbit's horn and so on. If there is the appearance of that which does not exist then, since both the abode and that which resides in it being [perishable](http://# "Like the seed which is the abode and the sprout which resides in it."),and that which is not presently existing has nothing to distinguish it, that which is not a deposit in the abode-substance cannot come into existence. Or it can be anything else like a hand, etc[^666].

[^666]: "There has to be some logical connection between what comes out of what."

 यदि वा,अत्यन्तासदेव शशविषाणाद्युत्पद्येत।अतो विशिष्टं हि त्रयाणामसत्त्वं वासिते बीजे।तस्मादवस्थितं कारकं भूतभविष्यत्कालानेकवृत्तियोगि चाभ्युपगन्तव्यम्।अन्यथा प्रत्ययमात्रं क्षणिकं चित्तमिति समर्थयमानस्य समाधीयमानमपि (समर्थ्यमानमपि) गोमयपायसीयन्यायमाक्षिपति॥

 Let us say that something which is totally non-existent like a rabbit's horn is to come into existence. Then the abode-seed is to be distinguished by a non-existent in all the three [times](http://# "Past, present and future non-existence."). For that, one has to accept an agent which is connected with many ideas of past and future. Otherwise, just by saying that the mind is nothing but momentary ideas is "samādhīyamānamapyetat gomayapāyasīnyāyamākṣipati" = worse than the reasoning that cow-dung is a milky preparation because it comes from the cow, like milk.

 Even if argued most vehemently, giving many reasons like both being products of the cow and so on, it is not possible to convert cow-dung into a milk dish. Similar is the case of trying to connect memory, etc., with a momentary mind.

 Moreover,—

“svātmānubhavāpaḥnavaḥcittasyānyatve" = if the mind is only ideas (one after another), there is denial of one's own experience in that one does not remember what another has seen.

 On the other hand, when asked 'What have you seen' he would have to say I have not seen' even though he has seen (it); as in his view what was seen, was seen by [another](http://# "The earlier mind being momentary should not be theoretically associated with the later experience according to this theory."). And when he denies it how can there be knowledge of what has been experienced like 'That which I saw I am myself touching','That which I touched I am



myself remembering'. Cognition and memory having the same agent, knowledge has the capacity to bring them together. Otherwise it will be as 'What was seen by someone similar to me I, who am similar to that someone, am touching it, am remembering it.'

 The idea of I in "sarvasya" = every man, which is present as the same subject underlying both memory and ideas "pratyayabhede pratyayinyabhinne [copasthitaḥ](http://# "The bhāṣya has the reading... abhedenopasthitaḥ' whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has ... abhinne copasthitaḥ'.")"= even when the ideas are different like 'I am seeing, I am touching, I am remembering', etc., is directly perceived as the subject of those ideas, and as identical with the one possessing the ideas.

 Objection—

Even though the subject is one there is one who knows the object of an idea and there is another who has the memory of it—

it cannot be that 'I know the object' and 'I remember the object' are identical—

they are indeed different by the fact of the words ‘thinker' and 'rememberer'.

 Answer—

In that context he says—

That is not so, as it is directly perceived. He indicates that (through the words) "svānubhavagrāhyaścāyamabhedātmā ahamiti [pratyayaḥ](http://# "This idea that 'I am the self which is not different' is knowable in one's own experience.")".

 Objection—

It can be said that due to the words 'thinker' and 'rememberer' being different and due to the ideas being [different](http://# "Idea of thinking and idea of remembering are not identical."),one has to infer the I-notion as having different objects.

 Answer—

He then says "na hi pratyakṣasya māhātmyam ... [abhibhūyate](http://# "The Vivaraṇakāra uses 'hi' instead of 'ca' though that is the reading present in the available bhāṣya.")"= the authoritativeness of direct perception like that of form before one's eyes is not overthrown by inference.

किं च—

प्रत्यक्षं प्रमाणमयमहंप्रत्ययो न तत् स्मृतिप्रत्ययानामेकस्मिन् कर्तरि सामान्येन वर्तमानः।स चेत् प्रत्यक्षप्रमाणभूतोऽनुमानेनाभिभूयेत,तदानीमनुमानस्यापि प्रमाणत्वं हीयेत।तन्मूलत्वादनुमानस्य। तदेतदाह—

प्रमाणान्तरं च प्रत्यक्षबलेनैव प्रामाण्यव्यवहारं लभत इति।तेन प्रत्यक्षविरोधेन अनुमानविरोधेन च प्रतिवादि

(पादित)प्रमाणप्रतिज्ञादोषो व्याख्यातः॥

 Moreover the idea of 'I am [this](http://# "The identical I-notion underlying all experiences.")' is based on the authority of direct perception and is not something existing in one subject underlying all experiences and memory in a general [way](http://# "As belonging to a stream of ideas, memories, etc."). If that which is the result of direct perception is overthrown by inference then the authoritativeness of inference will also be under [suspicion](http://# "Inference, in the case, cannot be trusted."),as it



(perception) is the basis for inference. Thus he (Vyāsa) says—

“pramāṇamantaram ca pratyakṣabalenaiva vyavahāram labhate" = (any other source of knowledge ) gains authority (only by the power of perception). Thus the defects of a conclusion based on the opponent's argument which is against (both) perception and inference has been pointed out (explained).

 भूतभविष्यत्प्रत्ययेभ्यो नान्यो वर्तमानः प्रत्ययी,एकसन्तानसंबन्धित्वे सति बोधात्मकत्वात्,आत्मनो यथा स्वरूपात्॥

 The present substratum of the subliminal-impressions of ideas (experiences) is not different (identical) from the substratum of the subliminal-impressions of both past and future ideas; it is of the essence of knowledge being connected with a single [stream](http://# "'The basis of the ideas-past, present or future being the same substratum, it is a single stream unlike the Buddhists' concept of a stream of similar or dissimilar ideas.") like the nature of the self.

 The substratum of the subliminal-impressions of the past and future ideas is not different from the substratum of the subliminal-impressions of the present ideas as it is connected in one stream through the essence of knowledge like in the nature of the self.

 The present knower of the notion of 'I' is not different from the past and future knowers of it. This is so because being the knower is by being connected with the same single stream, as in its own nature.

 The present idea is not separated from the past and future knowers as it is of the essence of knowledge being connected in a single stream of the nature of being coloured by the [self](http://# "The tendency of the Vivaraṇakāra to repeat the same idea is again evident here.").

 The present knower is not different from the past and future ideas as it is of the essence of knowledge being connected in a single stream as of the nature of the Self.

 One does not find the mutual mixing up of memories of separate streams and one





also sees that memory is in the individual [stream](http://॑॑॑॑# "This is an observed phenomenon.")therefore it is established that there is a single agent. Thus it is established through the authority of perception which is the weightiest of all proofs. There is nothing that inference can accomplish in that context. One does not take help from a mirror in order to see a mark on the palm of one's hand.

 Even so,those who cannot tolerate the defeat of the inference-arguments stated by the Vaināśika Buddhists bring up artificial (not logical) counter-inferences (to prove their point).Therefore he says "tasmādekamanekārthamavasthitam ca [cittam](http://# "Vyāsabhāṣya.")"(therefore it is established that the mind is one, it is the support of many objects and it is stable).

 "yasyedam śāstreṇa parikarma [nirdiśyate](http://# "Miśra and other commentators consider this portion as introduction to sūtra 1.33 whereas the Vivaraṇakāra and Bhikṣu consider this as part of the bhāṣya under 1.32.")".He points out how this teaching in the scripture is the cause for the steadiness of the mind. For instance, one does not wash and protect a pot which is [perishable.](http://# "The advice to purify the mind strengthens the argument that it is an enduring entity.Cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. I, p. 68.")"

 तत्कथम्—

 Of what nature is this purification.

मैत्रीकरुणामुदितोपेक्षाणां सुखदुःखपुण्यापुण्यविषयाणां भावनातश्चित्तप्रसादनम्॥३३॥

 The mind attains clarity by cultivating friendliness, compassion, joy and indifference towards happiness, pain, virtue and vice (that is to say, towards those who are happy, those who are miserable, those who are virtuous and those who are evilminded).

 तत्र सर्वप्राणिषु सुखसम्भोगापन्नेषु मैत्रीं भावयेत्। दुःखितेषु करुणाम्।पुण्यात्मकेषु मुदिताम्।अपुण्यशीलेषूपेक्षाम्।एवमस्य भावयतः शुक्लोधर्म उपजायते। ततश्च चित्तं प्रसीदति। प्रसन्नमेकाग्रं स्थितिपदं लभते॥३३॥

 Of these (four) one should cultivate friendliness towards all beings who have attained happiness; compassion towards those who are in pain; joy towards those engaged in meritorious deeds (dharma); indifference towards those engaged in evil deeds (adharma). When he thus cultivates (friendliness and the other qualities) (then) there arises white (pure, sāttvika) ‘dharma'; then the mind becomes clear; and when clear it attains one-pointed stability.

 कथं चित्तपरिकर्म निर्दिश्यते? तथैकतत्त्वाभ्यास इति चोक्तम्, किं च तदेकं तत्त्वम्? यद्विषयोऽभ्यास इति। तत आह —

 What is the kind of purification which is enjoined? Practice on a single entity has been [mentioned](http://॑# "YS, I.32.").And what is that single entity with regard to which there is (to be) constant practice. So he says *maitrīkaruṇāmuditopeksāṇām sukhaduḥkhapunyāpuṇyaviṣayāṇām bhāvanātaścittaprasādanam. maitrī* is the feeling towards a friend; rejoicing in happiness on seeing people who are happy without having any feeling of envy. Similarly, towards those who are in pain “karuṇām" = compassion, sympathy in pain, “puṇyātmakeṣu muditām" = a kindred joy, “[apuṇyaśīleṣūcopekṣām](http://॑# "The Vivaraṇakāra adds a 'ca' which is not found in the bhāṣya.")"= towards those engaged in evil deeds he should cultivate indifference, it is added.

 सर्वत्रैवमस्य भावयतः, शुक्ल इति विशुद्धः प्राण्युपघातादिवर्जनाच्छुक्लोधर्मः। ततः स धर्म इव जातश्चित्तं प्रसादयति। तेन प्रसन्नं चित्तमेकाग्रं स्थितिपदं लभते। एकाग्रतया समाधीयत इत्यर्थः तदुक्तम्—

'प्रसन्नचेतसो ह्याशु बुद्धिः पर्यवतिष्ठते' इति॥

 When he thus practises these qualities all the time "śukla dharmaḥ” (he acquires) pure dharma as there is no harm to living [beings](http://# "In the performance of sacrifices, for instance, there is no pure dharma as there is animal sacrifice - but here there is nothing of that sort.")."tataḥ" = that dharma which arises makes the mind clear.And due to that "prasannam cittamekāgram sthitipadam labhate" = it attains one-pointed samādhi. Thus it is said the mind of one who has clarity becomes [steady](http://# "Bha. Gītā, II.65.")'.

 तत्रोपेक्षाया अक्रियारूपत्वाद्धर्माहेतुत्वे सति किमर्थमिहोपादानम्? उच्यते—

 तस्मादित्थं समाहितचित्तस्य मैत्रीकरुणाद्येकतत्त्वालम्बनं चित्तं शीलयतः प्रागभिहिता अन्तराया न जनिष्यन्ते॥३३॥

 Objection—

Since indifference is of the nature of inactivity it is not the cause of 'dharma'; so why has it been mentioned here?

 Answer—

If indifference is not included then the mind would have become engaged (occupied) towards those engaged in evil deeds. And then from the dirt which comes about by that engagement, it (mind) will not be fit for meditation on friendliness, etc. It has also been included with the fear that due to engagement with the evilminded, there should be no adharma accruing in the form of cause and [effect](http://# "The cause being engagement with evil-minded persons and the effect being adharma.");its sole purpose is only to achieve steadiness of the mind. The (only) desire here is steadiness of the mind.

 Therefore, one who has achieved steadiness of the mind in this way, practising



meditation on one principle like friendliness, compassion, etc., will have no obstacles already [mentioned.](http://# "YS, I.30 & 31.")

**प्रच्छर्दनविधारणाभ्यां वा प्राणस्य॥३४ ॥**

 Or (he gains stability of mind) through exhalation (pracchardana) and retention (vidhāraṇa) of breath.

 कौष्ठ्यस्य वायोः नासिकापुटाभ्यां प्रयत्नविशेषात् वमनं प्रच्छर्दनम्। विधारणं प्राणायामः।ताभ्यां वा मनसः स्थितिं सम्पादयेत्॥३४॥

 Exhalation is the throwing out (ejection) of the abdominal air through the nostril by a special kind of effort. Retention is suspension (restraint) of breath. Or,by these two (methods),the yogī should attain stability of the mind.

 प्रच्छर्दनविधारणाभ्यां वा प्राणस्य। वाशब्दो मैत्र्यादिभावनोपायान्तरविकल्पार्थः।मैत्र्यादिभावनाद्युपायानामन्यतमेन येन केनचित् चित्तस्थितिः सम्पादनीयेति प्रकरणार्थः।अनेकोपायप्रदर्शनं कस्यचित् क्वचित् सुकरताभिप्रायेण। प्रच्छर्दनविधारणाभ्यां व्यस्ताभ्यां समस्ताभ्यां वा। प्रच्छर्दनम् कौष्ठ्यस्य वायोरातमितोरुद्वमनं नासिकाभ्याम्,न मुखेन।विधारणं प्राणायाम आतमितोरेव।यद्यपि प्रच्छर्दनेनापि प्राणः आयम्यते, तथापि बहिर्वृत्तिर्न निरुध्यत इति विधारणं प्राणायाम इति विशेष्यते॥३४॥

* pracchardanavidhāraṇābhyām vā prāṇasya.* The word vā i.e.,‘or', is in the sense of an option i.e., it is to indicate an alternative method to the feelings of friendliness, etc., (in order to steady the mind).This set of sūtras means that through any one of the methods beginning with practice of friendliness, etc., steadiness of the mind is to be [achieved.](http://# "The Vivaraṇakāra takes the collection of sūtras beginning with 1.33 as alternative means for steadying the mind. So does Vijñānabhikṣu. But Vācaspati Miśra understands the option only for sūtras beginning with I.34 and does not include I.33 in that group. This seems to agree with Vyāsa's bhāsya as well. Vyāsa mentions 'prānāyāma' as a means for 'sthiti' and 'maitrī', etc., as a means of purification of the mind. Cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. I, p. 191.")

 The mention of many methods is with the idea that to someone, at sometime, any one method may be easy to follow. Exhalation and retention either separately or [together.](http://# "How this can be done separately is not made clear. Retention is only after exhalation or inhalation. Perhaps this is a reference to the kevala kuṃbhaka mentioned in the Sādhanapāda. Cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. II, pp. 229-31.") "pracchardanam" is the throwing out of the abdominal air up to the [limit](http://# "Till one is exhausted."),through the nostrils and not through the mouth.

 “vidhāraṇam prānāyāmaḥ"= (it is suspension of breath) up to the limit itself. Even though there is restraint of breath (prāṇa) in pracchardana also still there is no restriction in the process of going out; therefore vidhāraṇa has been added to indicate [prānāyāma](http://# "āyāma of prāṇa is not there in pracchardana.").



**विषयवती वा प्रवृत्तिरुत्पन्ना मनसः स्थितिनिबन्धिनी॥३५॥**

 Or (he) gains stability of the mind when a sense-activity (pravṛtti), which has direct-perception of an object (viṣayavatī) arises.

**** नासिकाग्रे धारयतोऽस्य या दिव्यगन्धसंवित् सा गन्धप्रवृत्तिः।जिह्वाग्रे रससंवित्।तालुनि रूपसंवित्।जिह्वामध्ये स्पर्शसंवित्।जिह्वामूले शब्दसंवित्,इत्येता वृत्तय उत्पन्नाश्चित्तं स्थितौ निबध्नन्ति,संशयं विधमन्ति,समाधिप्रज्ञायां च द्वारीभवन्ति इति। एतेन चन्द्रादित्यग्रहमणिप्रदीपरश्म्यादिषु प्रवृत्तिरुत्पन्ना विषयवत्येव वेदितव्या।

 The consciousness of supernatural smell which comes to one concentrating on the tip of the nose is the sense-activity having smell (as object); (concentrating) on the tip of the tongue (there is) the consciousness of (supernatural) taste;(concentrating) on the palate (there is) consciousness of (supernatural) colour; (concentrating) on the middle of the tongue (there is) consciousness of (supernatural) touch; (concentrating) on the root of the tongue (there is) consciousness of (supernatural) sound. These modifications, when arisen, hold the mind in stability, dispel doubt and become openings to the discriminate-discernment (prajñā) of 'samādhi'.Thus, when sense-activity directed towards the moon or the sun or planets or gems or the rays of a lamp or similar objects arises, it should be known that it has direct perception of that object.

**** यद्यपि हि तत्तच्छास्त्रानुमानाचार्योपदेशैरवगतमर्थतत्त्वं सद्भूतमेव भवति।एतेषां यथाभूतार्थप्रतिपादनसामर्थ्यात्। तथाऽपि यावदेकदेशोऽपि कश्चिन्न स्वकरणसंवेद्यो भवति,तावत् सर्वं परोक्षमिवापवर्गादिषु सूक्ष्मेष्वर्थेषु न दृढां बुद्धिमुत्पादयति। तस्माच्छास्त्रानुमानाचार्यापदेशोपोद्बलनार्थमेवावश्यं कश्चिदर्थविशेषः प्रत्यक्षीकर्तव्यः।

  तथा च सति श्रद्धावीर्यस्मृतिसमाधयोऽस्याप्रतिबन्धेन भविष्यन्तीति॥३५॥

 Even though the essence of objects as they really are, is known by means of the various śāstras and by inference and by the teachings of the masters, since these have the capacity to reveal the objects as they are, still, when there is even some part whatsoever which is not knowable through one's sense-organs then the whole seems to be mediately perceived (parokṣam); (and) it does not give rise to a definite knowledge in such subtle objects like 'apavarga'. Therefore, in order only to strengthen the ‘śāstras’, inference and the teachings of the masters,someone particular object, definitely, must necessarily be made an object of perception. Then, when there is perception of any part of an object taught by these (means), then all subtle objects up to even ‘apavarga' (release,liberation) is believed. For this purpose alone is the purification of the mind enjoined.

 When there are unsteadied (aniyatāsu) modifications and when the detachment called 'vaśīkāra' has arisen with regard to these (sūtra I.15) then (the mind) becomes capable of perceiving these various objects.And in that state faith, energy, memory and 'samādhi' (sūtra I.20) come to him without any obstacles.

 viṣayavatīvā pravṛttirutpannā sthitinibandhinī. The word 'cittasya' has to be added (in order to complete the [sense](http://॒# "The Vivaraṇakāra does not have the word 'manasaḥ' in the sūtra. While quoting the sūtra he leaves out the word and thus feels the need of adding cittasya to the sūtra in order to complete the sense.")).

 The sense-objects are smell and so on; when the support is in the form of knowing smell, etc., as a yogic activity, then it is known as that having direct perception of the object, (viṣayavatī).

* pravṛttiḥ.* The face-to-face experience (of the object of meditation) of the yogī practising yoga.The first face-to-face experience of one practising yoga induces confidence in him and creates enthusiasm with regard to the practice of yoga; it is like the rise of smoke when wood is being rubbed together for the creation of fire—that is pravṛttiḥ. That kind of activity which arises gives joy, as it creates confidence and binds the mind to steadiness.

 नासिकाग्रे चित्तं धारयतो गन्धसंवित् प्रह्लादनकरसुरभिगन्धसंवेदनं निरन्तरतया सम्मतसंयोगमिवाचक्षाणा जायते। सा गन्धप्रवृत्तिः। तथा जिह्वादिषु। धारयत इति सम्बध्यते। ता एताः प्रवृत्तयः स्थितौ चित्तं निबध्नन्ति। संशयं विधमन्ति समाधिप्रज्ञायाश्च द्वारीभवन्ति॥

 “nāsikāgre cittam dhārayato [gandhasaṃvit](http://# "The Vivaraṇakāra has this reading.")".(When concentrating on the tip of the nose) there arises a consciousness of a delightful smell which creates a sensation of joy which continues as if experiencing some desired object by ordinary [sense-contact.](http://# "It is like any ordinary sense experience, provided it is done in the manner prescribed.")That is called the sense activity having smell (as object). So also one should understand concentration of the tongue and others. They are all connected with the word “[dhārayataḥ](http://# "These various senses are objects of concentration; thus the word 'dharayataḥ' has to be added in each case in order to complete the sense.")”.‘‘tāḥpravṛttayaḥsthitau cittam nibadhnanti,saṃśayam vidhamantisamādhiprajñāyāśca[dvārībhavanti](http://# "There is no ‘tāḥin the bhāṣya text and instead of 'samādhiprajñāyāśca' the reading is 'samādhi-prajñāyām.")" (These modifications when arisen,hold the mind in stability, dispel doubt and become openings to prajñā of samādhi).

 By concentrating the mind on a ray, moon, sun, planet, lamp, etc., or when due to disturbance, when concentrating on the heart-lotus there is the appearance of a ray, moon, and so on, this is the sense-activity pertaining to those [objects](http://# "The word ‘raśmi' is placed at the beginning instead of 'candra'. After 'graha' the word 'mai' which comes in the text is left out altogether.").

 "yadyapi śāstrānumānācāryebhyo' vagatamarthatattvam tathābhūtameva ...[pratyakṣīkartavyaḥ](http://# "Many words of the bhāṣya have been substituted and some have been omitted by the Vivaraṇakāra. Thus (a) 'sadbhūtam' has been replaced by ‘tathābhūtam', (b) 'ācāryopadeśaiḥ' becomes 'ācāryebhyaḥ', (c) ‘kaścinna bhavati', becomes ‘na bhavati', (d) 'ācāryopadeśopodbalanārtham' becomes ‘ācāryopodbalanārtham,' (e) kaścidarthaviśeṣṣaḥ' is replaced by 'kaścidviśeṣaḥ'.")." (Even though the essence of objects, as they are, is known from the scriptures through inference and through the teachings of the gurus) as there is no uncertainty about them, because one is not aware of their being contradicted, still, when there is even some part...([is believed](http://# "There is nothing new added by the Vivaraṇakāra by way of explanation. He only repeats what Vyāsa says in his bhāṣya.")).

 “etadarthamevam cittaparikarma (nirdiśyate)" = it is for this purpose that purification of the mind is taught through the sūtras beginning with [*maitrikaruṇā*](http://# "YS, I.33."),etc., and ending with [*paramāṇuparamamahattvānto'sya vaśīkāraḥ*](http://# "YS, I.40."), qualified by yama, niyama, [āsana](http://# "YS, II.29. yama, niyama, āsana, etc. are mentioned in the second chapter for the beginner and middling yogīwhereas this chapter is for the superior yogī.").

 तदेतदुक्तं भवति—एतत्प्रकरणोपदिष्टानामुपायानामन्यतमानुष्ठानात् प्रत्यक्षीकृतैकदेशतया विधूत (पिध्मात) संशयं तु आ अपवर्गात् दृढावस्थितश्रद्धानादि प्रशान्तबहिर्वृत्ति उपस्थितवशीकारसंज्ञावैराग्यं तस्य तस्य तृतीयपादोपदिष्टपरिणामत्रयादेरर्थस्य प्रत्यक्षीकरणाय समर्थं स्यात् ज्ञानविभूत्यादिप्राप्यर्थमिति। ततश्चैवमर्थं चित्तपरिकर्मोपदिश्यत इति प्रकरणार्थः।तथा च भाष्यकारः प्रदर्शितवान्—'एतदर्थमेवेदं चित्तपरिकर्म' इत्येवमादिना॥३५॥

 Thus it can be said that by following anyone of the methods taught in this section, when someone particular thing is directly perceived, then doubt is removed regarding everything including liberation; there is great faith firmly established, modifications of the mind moving outwards are subdued (calmed) and detachment known as ‘[vaśīkāra](http://# "YS, I.15.")'is present. Then he will be able to directly perceive (experience) the things as taught in the third chapter beginning with the sūtra [*pariṇāmatraya*](http://# "YS, III.16. This sūtra states that saṃyama when practised on the three mutations, gives knowledge of the past and future.")' in order to achieve the perfection of [knowledge](http://# "YS, III.16–32. In these sūtras the various siddhis that come to a yogī is described. But the ultimate purpose is the achievement of knowledge of the pure nature of the self, though on the way, the siddhis come on their own.").Thus the meaning of this section (set of sūtras)



is that the purification of the mind is taught for this purpose. So the commentator indicates this (through the words beginning with ) "etadarthamevedam cittakarma".

विशोका वा ज्योतिष्मती ॥३६॥

 Or (he gains stability of mind when there is ) a luminous (sense-activity) (jyotiṣmatī) which is painless.

 प्रवृत्तिरुत्पन्ना मनसः स्थितिनिबन्धिनीत्यनुवर्तते।हृदयपुण्डरीके धारयतो या बुद्धिसंवित्,बुद्धिसत्त्वं हि प्रभास्वरमाकाशकल्पम्,तत्र स्थितिवैशारद्यात् प्रवृत्तिः सूर्येन्दुग्रहमणिप्रभारूपाकारेण विकल्पते।तथा अस्मितायां समापन्नं चित्तं निस्तरङ्गमहोदधिकल्पं शान्तमनन्तमस्मितामात्रं भवति।

 यत्रेदमुक्तम्—“तमणुमात्रमात्मानमनुविद्यास्मीत्येवं तावत्संजानीते” इति। एषा द्वयी विशोका विषयती,अस्मितामात्रा च प्रवृत्तिर्ज्योतिष्मतीत्युच्यते। यया योगिनश्चित्तं स्थितिपदं लभत इति॥३६॥

 The words 'sense-activity, when arisen, gives rise to stability of the mind' follow (from the previous sūtra I.35).

 The consciousness of the intellect (which arises on) concentrating on the heart-lotus (gives rise to stability of the mind). For, the sattva-intelligence is luminous and (all-pervading) like ether; by the skill in keeping steady in this (heart-lotus) the sense-activity assumes alternatively the brilliance of the sun, moon, planets or gems.

 Similarly, when the mind has attained steadiness in the sense of 'I' (asmitā) it becomes similar to a waveless ocean, tranquil, unlimited and just a sense of ‘I’.

 With regard to which it has been said "Pondering on that ātman which is a mere atom (the yogī) realizes himself in the form 'I am'."

 These two luminous sense-activities are said to be of two kinds — (1) the painless (luminous-activity) which perceives an object (2) (the luminous-activity) which is just the sense of 'I'; by means of which the mind of the yogī gains stability.

 विशोका वा ज्योतिष्मती प्रवृत्तिरुत्पन्ना मनसः स्थितिनिबन्धिनीति प्रकृतमभिसंबध्यते।ज्योतिर्यस्यां विद्यते प्रवृत्तौ सा ज्योतिष्मती।सा च शोकं व्यपगमयतीति विशोका नाम ॥

 सा च कथमुपजायत इत्याह—हृदयपुण्डरीके धारयतो बुद्धिसंविद्भवति स्वरूपसंवेदनम्।बुद्धिसत्त्वं हि किंरूपमित्याह—बुद्धिसत्त्वं हि प्रभास्वरं प्रभासनशीलमाकाशकल्पं व्यापि ॥

* vi*ś*okā vā jyotiṣmatī pravṛttirutpannā manasaḥ sthitinibandhinī*. In order to connect it to the context the words 'he gains stability of the mind when there is sense-activity' has to be [added](http://# "The words pravṛttirutpannā, etc., follow from YS, I.35.").That sense-activity which has light is *jyotiṣmatī* and that removes sorrow totally, so it is called viśokā.

 He mentions how that arises (through the words) "hṛdayapuṇḍarīke dharayato [buddhisaṃvitbhavati](http://# "The Vivaraṇakāra leaves out 'yā' before buddhisaṃvit'.")"and so on; i.e., it is a knowledge of the true nature of buddhi. In answer to the question as to what the nature of the sattva-intellect is he says “buddhisattvam hi prabhāsvaramākāśakalpam" = it is of the nature of luminosity, it is all-pervading like ether.



 यत्र यस्मिन् बुद्धिसत्त्वे॥

“[yatra](http://# "The word in the bhāṣya is tatra' and not 'yatra'.")”= in that sattva-intellect “[sthitivaiṣaṃyāt](http://# "The Vivaraṇakāra uses the word 'sthitivaisamyāt' instead of 'sthitivaiśaradyat'.'Vaiśāradya' and 'Vaiṣamya' are totally different concepts and to substitute one for the other makes no sense.")"as the stability of the sattva- intellect has not attained oneness with its own self, the luminous sense-activity of one concentrating on the heart-lotus assumes alternatively the brilliance of the sun, moon or gem[^667].

[^667]: "The Vivaraṇakāra again leaves out the word 'graha' in 'sūryendugrahamaṇi...'."

 "tathā cāsmitāyām samāpannam...[bhavati](http://# "There is no 'ca' in 'asmitāyām in the bhāṣya.")".When the buddhi-sattva has become one with the '[I](http://# "It is strange that the Vivaraṇakāra uses the word ahaṃkāra for asmitā. Commentators like Vijñānabhikṣu have tried hard to point out the difference between ahaṃkāra and asmitā. Cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. I, pp. 199-200.")'(ego) i.e., when it has attained oneness with its own nature (then it becomes similar to a waveless ocean, tranquil, unlimited and just a sense-of-[I](http://# "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything on his own and just quotes the bhāṣya here.")).

 यत्रेदमुक्तं यत्रास्मितासमापत्तौ। तं एतं प्रकृतमस्मितात्मानमहङ्कारम् अणुं सूक्ष्मम् आत्मानमनुविद्य प्राप्य अस्मीत्येवंतावत्संजानीत इति। यादृशमालम्बनस्वरूपं तावन्मात्रं सञ्जानीते। अहङ्कारस्वरूपेणैव तदानुरूप्यादवच्छिद्यते,स्फटिकमणिरिवोपधानरूपेण। एवं द्वयी विशोका प्रवृत्तिर्विषयवती चास्मितामात्रा च।तत्र गन्धसंविदादिरस्मितामात्रान्ता सर्वा विशोकैव।ज्योतिष्मती पुनर्गन्धसंविदादिप्रवृत्तिपञ्चतयादन्यत्र।विषयवती त्वस्मितामात्रात् प्रागेवेत्येवं विषयविभागः। यया विशोकया ज्योतिष्मत्या योगिनश्चित्तं स्थितिपदं लभते॥३५॥

 “yatredamuktam”.“yatra” = regarding this samāpatti ([samādhi](http://# "There is technically in yoga difference between samāpatti and samādhi, one being the end of samādhi and the other being the means. Cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. I, pp. 206-13."))in the sense-of-I (it is said)-having attained that self of the nature of the sense-of-I,the ahamkāra, “aṇum” = the subtle, (they) realise it as of the form 'I am'. It is to be realized as of the nature of the support itself. It is distinguished from [its](http://# "The object of support is ahaṃkāra but the samāpatti is not of the ego but of the sense-of-I.") likeness through being its true nature [itself](http://# "Pure sense-of-I. asmitā, ātmatā and ahantā taken to be synonyms."). This is like a crystal which takes on the colour of what is placed on it.  
In this manner there are two painless sense-activities which are "viṣayavatī” and “cāsmitāmātra”.In that context, all of them beginning with consciousness of (divine) fragrance and ending with the bare 'sense-of-I' are without sorrow (pain).

 The luminous sense-activity,on the other hand,is different from the fivefold consciousness of (supernatural) fragrance, [etc.](http://# "Divine smell, divine sight and so on, associated with each of the senses.")The sense-activity (activities)



having direct perception of an object precedes the bare sense-of-I; thus there is a division of [subject-matter](http://# "There is a sense of ascent in the spiritual ladder; the last stage is the 'sense-of-I' and it is a luminous, radiant, self-consciousness."). By means of this painless luminous (sense-activity) the mind of the yogīattains stability.

**वीतरागविषयं वा चित्तम् ॥३७॥**

 Or by having as its object (a mind ) freed from attachment, the mind (gains stability).

 वीतरागचित्तालम्बनोपरक्तं वा योगिनश्चित्तं स्थितिपदं लभत इति॥३७॥

 Or when the mind of the 'yogī' is coloured (uparakta) by having as its supporting objects, a mind freed from attachment, it gains stability.

 वीतरागविषयं वा चित्तं वीतो रागो यस्मात् प्रत्ययात् स वीतरागः रागशून्य इत्यर्थः। स एष विषय आलम्बनं यस्य चित्तस्य तद्वीतरागविषयम्। वीतरागश्च प्रत्ययः प्रसिद्धो लोके। रागिणोऽपि हि पुरुषस्य रागकारणेऽपि विषये,यः स्त्रीषु मात्रादिषु। स एव प्रत्ययः \[तमेव प्रत्ययं\] वीतरागः \[गं\] आलम्बनत्वेनाभ्यस्येत्;न तु तस्य यो विषयः आलम्बनम्।विषयाणां खलत्वात्।तत् वीतरागप्रत्ययालम्बनोपरक्तं चित्तं तद्वदेव वीतरागं प्रसन्नतरं स्थितिपदं लभते। रागादिखलीकृतं हि कृतखलीनमिव तुरङ्गमाननं प्रचलति॥३७॥

* vītarāgaviṣayam vā cittam*. That thought (mind) from which attachment has gone is that freed from attachment i.e., which is devoid of attachment. That mind which has such an object as support (for meditation) is *vītarāgaviṣayam.*

 Thought free from attachment is well-known in the world, as the case of a man who is naturally attached to objects being free from attachment even in the presence of causal objects like women and other objects. That thought (mind) freed from attachment should be used as the support of meditation. But its object must not be the [support](http://# "The object with reference to which detachment is felt must not be the support in meditation. Only the detached thought or mind can be the support."),because of the evils (dirt) associated with objects.

 "vītarāgapratyayālaṃbanoparaktamcittam sthitipadam[labhate".](http://# "Instead of 'citta' the Vivaranakāra has 'pratyaya'.")Thus the mind of the yogī, coloured by having as its support a thought (mind) freed from attachment gains great stability. A mind which has been dirtied through attachment and so on, runs like a horse with the bridle set in its [mouth.](http://# "The horse with the bridle in its mouth is not free but has to do the bidding of one who drives it. So also with an attached mind.")

**स्वप्ननिद्राज्ञानालम्बनं वा॥३८॥**

 Or by having as its supporting-object, a perception in dream or a perception in sleep (the mind gains stability).





 स्वप्नज्ञानालम्बनं वा निद्राज्ञानालम्बनं वा तदाकारं योगिनश्चित्तं स्थितिपदं लभत इति॥३८॥

 Or the mind of the yogi having a perception in dream as its supporting-object or having a perception in sleep as its supporting-object, gains stability by assuming that form.

 स्वप्ननिद्राज्ञानालम्बनं वा। स्वप्नज्ञानालम्बनं वा निद्राज्ञानालम्बनं वा चित्तं तदाकारमेव भवति। एवं स्वभावं हि चित्तं यदालम्बते तदाकारं भवति। स्वप्ने च शब्दादिविषयशून्यं ज्ञानम्। ज्ञानस्यापि स्वभावोऽवभासकता।तत्रापि ज्ञानस्वरूपमेवालम्बते।न तु स्मर्यमाणविषयस्वरूपम्।स्मर्यमाणेनापि विषयेण खलीकारो दृश्यते।निद्राज्ञानं तु विशेषाग्रहणात्मकमभावप्रत्ययालम्बनं शान्तमनन्तमनुभूयमानाचलनधर्मकम्। ततश्च तदालम्बनं सच्चित्तं स्थितिपदं लभत इति युक्तम्॥३८॥

* svapnanidrālaṃbanam vā*. "svapnajñāna... [tadākārameva](http://# "There is no 'cittam' after the second ‘vā' in the bhāsya — but the Vivaraṇakāra has it. There is also no 'eva' after 'tadākāram' in the bhāṣya. ")". The mind of this nature takes on the form of whatever is its [support](http://# "The form here spoken of is a perception in dream or a perception in deep sleep.").In the dream state knowledge is without objects like sound, etc., and the nature of (that) knowledge is just illumination. Therein, he has the true nature of knowledge as his support ( for meditation) and not the nature of the objects which are [remembered.](http://# "As in the previous sūtra the object towards which there is detachment is not relevant so also the remembered objects are irrelevant.")Even through the remembered object (the mind) can be polluted.

 The knowledge pertaining to deep sleep is of the nature of non-grasping of anything in particular, which has as its support an absence of any knowledge content, is peaceful, infinite, having the characteristic of experiencing immutability. It is proper that the mind having such a support gains stability.

**यथाभिमतध्यानाद्वा॥३९॥**

 Or by meditating on any object which is desired (the mind gains stability)

 यदेवाभिमतं तदेव ध्यायेत्। तत्र लब्धस्थितिकमन्यत्रापि स्थितिपदं लभत इति॥३९॥

 Meditation should be on an object that is desired. When (the mind) has attained stability in that object (tatra) it will attain stability in other objects as well.

 यथाभिमतध्यानाद्वा। यदेवाभिमतमिति चित्तस्थित्यपेक्षया। चित्तस्थितेः प्रकृतत्वात्।न तु सुखाद्यपेक्षया। प्रतिषिद्धत्वाच्च—“न त्वेव विषयान् प्राप्य धारयेत कथंचन” इति। तत्र लब्धस्थितिकं कर्मण्यं सत् अन्यत्र शास्त्रीयेषु अपि स्थितिपदं लभते॥३९॥

* yathābhimatadhyānādvā. “yadevābhimatam"* is with reference to the stability of the mind, for the purpose (of this teaching) is the stability of the mind and the purpose is not to gain pleasure and so on. [This](http://# "Seeking pleasure etc.") has also been prohibited (through statements like)—'na tveva viṣayān prāpya dhārayeta [kathaṃcana](http://# "Not traced. It means that one should not dwell on the aspect of pleasure etc., of objects, having obtained them.")'.Having found something





as an object of support on which he gains stability he can achieve stability in other things (also) mentioned in the teachings.

**परमाणुपरममहत्त्वान्तोऽस्य वशीकारः॥४०॥**

 His (yogī’s) mastery extends from the finest atom to the greatest magnitude.

**** सूक्ष्मे निविशमानस्य परमाण्वन्तं स्थितिपदं लभत इति। स्थूले निविशमानस्य परममहत्त्वान्तं स्थितिपदं चित्तस्य। एवं तामुभयीं कोटिमनुधावतो योऽस्याप्रतीघातः स परो वशीकारः। तद्वशीकारात्परिपूर्णं योगिनश्चित्तं न पुनरभ्यासकृतं परिकर्मापेक्षत इति॥४०॥

 The mind entering a subtle (object) gains stability which extends up to the smallest atom. The mind entering a gross (object) gains stability which extends up to the greatest magnitude. This lack of obstruction (apratighātaḥ) of the yogī, who in this way, travels (anudhāvataḥ) both these limits, has complete mastery. Filled by that mastery, the mind of the yogi does not again stand in need of any purification to be obtained by practice (of the methods mentioned in I.34–39).

 परमाणुपरममहत्त्वान्तोऽस्य वशीकारः। अन्तशब्दः प्रत्येकं संबध्यते। सूक्ष्मे निविशमानस्य परिमाणे निविशमानस्य योगिना संक्षिप्यमाणस्य। अभ्यासकाले त्वल्पमल्पतरं च क्रमेणालोचयत्परमाण्वन्तं संक्षिप्यते। स च परमाणुश्चित्तस्य संक्षेपकोटिः। तेन तदन्तं स्थितिपदम्॥

 तत्र संक्षिप्ता विशाला विकरणी चेति त्रयी धारणा। तत्रोभयकोटिस्पर्शिनी विकरणी। परममहत्वान्तस्पृग्विशाला। परमाण्वन्तस्पृक् संक्षिप्ता सा च त्रय्यपीह सूत्रोपात्ता॥४०॥

* paramāṇuparamamahattvānto'sya vaśīkāraḥ.*

 The word *antaḥ*is connected with each of the words (in the [sūtra](http://# "To both the words paramāṇu and paramamahattva the word 'antaḥ' is added in the sense of right to the end.")). "sūkṣme niviśamānasya" = when (the mind of) the yogī, contracting, enters a subtle object i.e., during the practice, while gradually concentrating on smaller and smaller (subtle) objects, he reaches the limit of the smallest atom. And that ultimate atom is the limit of curtailment of the (yogī's) mind. And he is able to gain stability right up to that limit.

 "itthamubhaya...parikarmāpekṣata [iti](http://# "The words itthamubhaya and cittasya, are both not part of the available bhāṣya.")"thus the experience of both the subtlest atom and the greatest magnitude, without the obstruction of any other thought, is complete mastery. The earlier ([stability of the mind](http://# "The stability mentioned in sūtras 1.34-39."))is also great mastery. But this (stability) has this distinction. "tadvaśīkārāt paripūrṇam..." i.e., when he has complete mastery there is no need of purification to be obtained by practice; whereas in the earlier instance, all of them are in need of further purification (practice).



In that context, concentration is threefold; the minutest, the greatest magnitude and vikariṇīwhich touches both the limits. Viśālā is what touches the limit of greatness, samkṣiptā is what touches the limit of minuteness; these three are mentioned here in the sūtra.

 अथ लब्धस्थितिकस्य चेतसः किंस्वरूपा किंविषया वा समापत्तिः इति— तदुच्यते—

 Now when the mind has attained stability what is the nature of (that) 'samāpatti' (balanced state) and (vā) what is its object?—

क्षीणवृत्तेरभिजातस्येव मणेर्ग्रहीतृग्रहणग्राह्येषु तत्स्थतदञ्जनता समापत्तिः॥४१॥

 The 'balanced state' of the mind which, like a precious gem has (its) modifications weakened, is the assumption of the form (of the supporting object) by gaining stability with reference to the grahītṛ( puruṣa as the knower) or grahaṇa (the sense-organs) or grāhya' (object to be known).

 क्षीणवृत्तेरिति प्रत्यस्तमितप्रत्ययस्येत्यर्थः।अभिजातस्येव मणेरिति दृष्टान्तोपादानम्।यथा स्फटिक उपाश्रयभेदात् तत्तद्रूपोपरक्त उपाश्रयरूपाकारेण निर्भासते,तथा ग्राह्यालम्बनोपरक्तं चित्तं ग्राह्यसमापन्नं ग्राह्यस्वरूपाकारेण निर्भासते।

भूतसूक्ष्मोपरक्तं भूतसूक्ष्मसमापन्नं भूतसूक्ष्मस्वरूपाभासं भवति।तथा स्थूलालम्बनोपरक्तं स्थूलरूपसमापन्नं स्थूलरूपाभासं भवति; तथा विश्वभेदोपरक्तं विश्वभेदसमापन्नं विश्वरूपाभासं भवति॥

 The word 'whose modifications are weakened' means 'whose thought process has come to an end’ ‘Like a precious gem' is citing an example. Just as a (clear) crystal is tinged by the various colours of the object which is adjacent to it and shines taking on the colour of the adjacent object, similarly the mind, tinged by the object which is its support (and) having attained oneness with the object (grāhyasamāpannam) shines with the form of the object. Similarly, (the mind) tinged by a subtle object (and) having attained oneness with the subtle object, seems to have the form of the subtle object. Similarly, (the mind) tinged by the support of a gross object (and) having attained oneness with the form of the gross object seems to have the form of the gross object. Similarly, (the mind) tinged by particular objects of the world (like the various movable and immovable objects of the world) (and) having attained oneness with the particular object of the world seems to have the form of the particular object.

 Similarly, one should understand (this samāpatti) with reference to the sense-organs also.(The mind) tinged by the support of a sense-organ (and) having attained oneness with the sense-organ, shines with the form of the sense-organ.



 Similarly, (the mind) tinged by the support of the 'puruṣa' as knower (grahītṛpuruṣa) (and) having attained oneness with the 'puruṣa' as knower, shines with the form of the 'puruṣa' as knower. Similarly, (the mind) tinged by the support of a liberated 'puruṣa' and having attained oneness with the liberated 'puruṣa' shines with the form of the liberated 'puruṣa'.

 Thus, in this way, the assumption of the form of the object of support by attaining stability in it of the mind, with reference to the knower, sense-organ and object of support i.e., with reference to the 'puruṣa', organ of sense and objects, is taking on the form of the object (of support) while remaining steadily in it; (and) that is called 'the balanced state' (samāpatti).

 "atha labdhasthitikasya cetasaḥ" = Now when the mind has attained stability by any of the methods mentioned above, what is the nature of that samāpatti (balanced state) and what is its object. In order to indicate that he gives the following sūtra—kṣīṇavṛtterabhijātasyeva maṇergrahītrgrāhyeṣu tatsthatadañjanatā samāpattiḥ.

 ननु च समापत्तेर्विषयं वक्ष्यति तृतीयपादे 'परार्थात् स्वार्थसंयमात् पुरुषज्ञानम्' इत्यादिना। समापत्तिस्वरूपं च संयमस्वरूपं तत्कार्यनिर्वर्तनेनैव सेत्स्यति। ततश्चानर्थकमिदं सूत्रम्—नैष दोषः—पूर्वोक्तोपायवशीकारेणार्थवत्त्वप्रदर्शनार्थत्वात्। एवं ह्येष चित्तवशीकारोऽर्थवान्, येन ग्रहीत्राद्यर्थसमापत्रं चित्तं तदाभासं भवतीति॥

 Objection—But then, the object of samāpatti will be mentioned in the third pada through the sūtra—parārthāt [svārthasaṃyamātpuruṣajñānam.](http://# "Vibhūtipāda, III.35, Cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. III, pp. 130 ff. By practising samyama on that which exists for itself as against that which exists for another, there arises the knowledge of the self.")It will be mentioned that the nature of samāpatti is the nature of [saṃyama](http://# "When the three-dhāraṇā, dhyāna and samādhi are practised with reference to the same object, it is called saṃyama. Cf. YS, III.4.")which is accomplished by the effect. Therefore this sūtra does not serve any purpose.

 Answer—There is no defect, as this sūtra has the purpose of showing the result of mastery of the above-mentioned methods. In this manner the mastery of the mind is accomplished when the mind, established on the object as knower (known or the process of knowing), takes on its form.

 Moreover, it has been mentioned (earlier) that samprajñāta is that accompanied by deliberation and so [on](http://# "YS, 1.17.").The nature of deliberation, etc., is also to be indicated here. If samāpatti is not mentioned then it is not possible to indicate the nature of vitarka and so on, as vitarka, etc., are the characteristics of samāpatti.  
"kṣīṇavṛtteh" and so on, means whose thought process based on outside proofs has come to an end.

 Objection — But then, all ideas are to come to an end. Only when all ideas have died away will they lose the capacity to give rise to any effect and will not rest on any gross or subtle object.

 "abhijātasyeva . . . . grahaṇasvarūpākāreṇa [nirbhāsate.](http://# "The Vivaraṇakāra has nothing to add to the bhāṣya. The reader can consult the bhāṣya translation for this portion.")"

 “tathā grahitṛpuruṣasamāpannam" i.e., (having attained oneness with) (puruṣa) of the nature of causing buddhi to know, shines in the form of puruṣa, as knower.

 "tathā muktapuruṣālaṃbanoparaktam". When that same puruṣa who is the knower of the intellect is no longer the knower of the modifications pertaining to objects, then it is the state of discriminate- discernment between the sattva-intellect and [puruṣa.](http://# "It is the state when there is an insight into the difference between the intellect and puruṣa.")

 यदा उदासीनो मुक्तपुरुष इत्युच्यते तदा हि सर्वक्लेशादिमुक्तं चित्तं, सैव हि पुरुषस्य मुक्तता, या क्लेशादिविमुक्तिश्चित्तस्य। अत एव सूत्रे ग्रहीतृग्रहणमेव कृतम्। ग्रहीता पुरुषविशेष एव मुक्तपुरुष इहाभिप्रेत इति॥

 त\[दा\]था हि पुरुषग्रहणमेव कुर्यात्। परस्यां वशीकारसंज्ञायां जातायां न पुनः संसारयोगो भवति। तथा चोक्तम्—

‘सत्येव चित्तसत्त्वसम्बन्धे क्लेशादिसम्बन्धाभावात् स तु सदैव मुक्तः सदैवेश्वरः' इति॥

 तस्मात् मुक्तपुरुषालम्बनोपरक्तं मुक्तपुरुषसमापन्नं मुक्तस्वरूपाकारेण निर्भासत इति। यो हि मन्यते निवृत्तसत्त्वसम्बन्धेनैव मुक्तेन पुरुषेण समापन्नं तदाकारमेव निर्भासत इति—

तदयुक्तम्—

चित्तस्य स्वात्मप्रलयप्रसङ्गात्॥

 When it is said that the liberated puruṣa is indifferent (passive) it means that the mind is freed from all afflictions, [etc.](http://# "A jīvanamukta is freed from kleśa, karmāśaya and vipāka.")That is the liberated state of puruṣa, where the mind has freedom from afflictions, etc. That is why there is mention of only the knower in the sutra. What he intends here by the liberated puruṣa is the special puruṣa as [knower](http://# "In the threefold division the knower aspect is the most important and that is stressed here."); otherwise he would have mentioned just the [puruṣa.](http://# "The significance of the use of the word grahītṛ is thus given by the Vivaraṇakāra.")

 When complete mastery known as vašīkāra has arisen there is no more connection with the world (of birth and death). Thus it is said Though there is still connection



with the sattva-mind still,as there is no connection with afflictions and so on, he is ever-free ever-[Īśvara.](http://# "The words 'sa tu sadaiva muktaḥ sadaiveśvaraḥ' is used by Vyāsa in sūtra 1.24 to describe Īśvara.The Vivaraṇakāra is probably using that line with some changes.")'

 Thus the mind coloured by the support of a liberated puruṣa and having attained oneness with the liberated puruṣa shines in the form of the liberated puruṣa. To think that by attaining oneness with a released puruṣa whose connection with the mind has ceased, one shines in that form is not [right](http://# "The connection is there but only the connection with afflictions and so on, is absent.");this will mean the dissolution of mind into [itself.](http://# "Into prakṛti which is also made up of the three guṇas like the mind. ")

 निरतिशयसूक्ष्मश्च पुरुषस्तत्समसूक्ष्मं प्रधानं तत्कार्यकार्यकार्यं (निमित्तं ) सत्त्वं,तच्चित्तं प्रधानं पुरुषं वा समापद्यमानं न स्थितेन स्वेन रूपेण समापत्तुमुत्सहते।न हि घटो मृदवस्थामपरित्यक्तस्वरूपः समापद्यते॥

 Puruṣa is the unexcelled limit of subtlety, and pradhāna is equally subtle and its effects, effect's [effect](http://# "mahat→ahamkāra→citta.") is the sattva-intellect; and that mind making itself one with either purușa or pradhāna, cannot attain steadiness by staying in its own form. For instance a pot cannot be identified as a pot without giving up the form of clay.

 ननु च कार्येणापि योगिसत्त्वेन महदहङ्कारौ संवेद्यावुच्येते।महति तावद्विप्रतिपत्तिः,संवेद्यते न वेति।यदा हि संवेद्यता ग्रहीतृमुक्तस्वरूपवत् संबन्धविशेष उपपद्यते महदहङ्कारयोरपि।व्यक्तौ हि तौ ततः संबन्धविशेषो युज्यते। संबन्धविशेषाच्च यथा स्वपुरुषो ग्रहीतृस्वरूपश्च मुक्तश्चचित्तवृत्तिविशेषसंबन्धात् गृह्यते तद्वत्। न तु सर्वात्मनैव महदहङ्कारयोरपि ग्रहणं महत्त्वात्॥

 Objection—But then, it is said that both mahat and [ahaṃkāra](http://# "It is the cosmic mahat and ahamkāra which are spoken of here.") are known to the sattva-intellect of the yogī though it is an effect ([of those two](http://# "This is a reference to the inability of the effect to know its cause.")).

 Answer—There is indeed great confusion regarding whether it is known or not. This knowledge can be a special relationship of the mahat and ahaṃkāra (with the sattva) like that of a knower and a released [self.](http://# "The puruṣa is known as the knower and also as the released in the case of a muktapuruṣa; this is also through the sattva-intellect which is an effect. So also mahat and ahamkāra can also be known through a special relationship.")A special relationship with the two manifest entities (mahat and ahaṃkāra) is in order.This is a special relationship like knowing through the relationship of a special mental modification that one's own puruṣa is of the nature of a knower as well as of the nature of a released self. But mahat and ahaṃkāra cannot be known as the self of all because of its cosmic nature.

 If they could be known as the self of all they would be known as just the sattva-mind and as the self alone and in that case they cannot be grasped as the object of [experience.](http://# "There would be no mind to grasp as in the cosmic stage individuation has not taken place.")And in the case of pradhāna and puruṣa and of their relationship, there can be no understanding of their true nature as they are absolutely unmanifest by nature.

 Objection—But then, Īśvara would not be omniscient if pradhāna and puruṣa and their relationship is not a matter of direct perception.

 Answer—

There is no confusion here as everything other than pradhāna and puruṣa and their relationship is a matter of direct perception as it is accepted that there is no limit to knowledge through direct perception. Īśvara knows that which is not known to us. If there is something to be known then it is definitely known in some way or the other, being a knowable cannot be understood without a knower.

 Moreover, if prakṛti and puruṣa could be knowable as objects by nature, then there would be the undesirable consequence of their being objects of experience like the mind. Then they would also exist for the sake of [another.](http://# "Like objects they would be for the enjoyment of others and will not exist for themselves.")And that other will have to be imagined as other than themselves.

 ननु पुरुषाणामन्योन्यभोग्यतेति न परो भोक्ता कल्प्यः—

 किञ्च—

भोग्यत्वे सुखादिरूपताप्रसङ्गश्च पुरुषस्य। तथा च सति प्रधानस्य निर्हेतुकत्वप्रसङ्गश्चेत्येवमादयो भूयांसो दोषाः॥

 Objection—

But then, the puruṣas can know each other mutually, therefore there is no need of imagining another knower.

 Answer—

That is not so; as the puruṣas are identical there cannot be a relationship of subject and object between them. Two lamps, for instance, do not favour each other (as subject and object).

 Moreover, in the event of being experienced there is the danger of puruṣa having pleasure and so on, as its nature. And in that case there would be the difficulty of pradhāna not being the cause (for pleasure, etc.); thus there are many [defects.](http://# "Since pradhana or sattva, rajas, tamas is the cause behind all worldly experiences this cannot hold true if puruṣa is itself subject to being experienced.")

 ननु च 'परार्थात् स्वार्थसंयमात् पुरुषज्ञानम्' इति पुरुषप्रत्यक्षतां वक्ष्यति — सत्यं युक्तमुक्तम्। अत एवोच्यते पुरुषो न स्वरूपेण विषयीभवतीति। येनैवं तत्रोक्तम् न च पुरुषप्रत्ययेन बुद्धिसत्वात्त्मना पुरुषो दृश्यते। पुरुष एव तं प्रत्ययं स्वालम्बनं पश्यतीति। तथा ह्युक्तम्—

'विज्ञातारमरे केन विजानीयात्' इतीति॥

 Objection—

But then, it will be said later that there is direct perception of puruṣa in the sūtra—

parārthāt svārthasaṃyamāt [puruṣajñānam.](http://# "YS, III.35. The point is that mahat (prakṛti) and ahaṃkāra (as puruṣa) are knowable through the mind which is an effect, according to this sūtra. This is in contradiction to what has been said earlier says the pūrvapakṣin.")



 Answer—What is said is right and is the truth. That is why it is said that puruṣa is not an object (of perception ) in truth. And that is why it is said there that “puruṣa is not known through the sattva intellect which has the idea of puruṣa. But puruṣa himself realizes that notion which has himself as its [support.](http://# "'VBh., under YS, III.35. Cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. III, pp. 130 ff.")" Thus it is said in the Upaniṣad ‘By whom is the knower to be [known](http://# "Br. Up., II.4.14.")'.

 ननु पुरुषालम्बनोपरक्तं चित्तं पुरुषस्य विषयः। तथा च सति प्रत्यक्ष एव पुरुषः। यथा घटालम्बनोपरक्ते प्रत्यये पुरुषेणोपलभ्यमाने घटः प्रत्यक्ष उच्यते—

नैष दोषः—

घटवत्पुरुषस्य चित्तेनाव्याप्यत्वात्। घटादिस्तु बाह्यश्चित्तेन व्याप्यते, न पुरुषः, आनन्त्यात्॥

 परिच्छिन्नं हि चित्तं विषयीकुर्वन्नपुरुषं विषयिणमनन्तं व्याप्तुमुत्सहते । यदि पुरुषं व्याप्नोति प्रधानमपि व्याप्नुयात् ॥

 Objection—But then, the mind coloured by the puruṣa as support is the object of puruṣa. In that case puruṣa is an object of direct perception. For instance when puruṣa receives (by reflection) an idea (mind) coloured by the pot as support one says that the pot is directly [perceived.](http://# "The pūrvapakṣin argues that there is no difference between the perception of a pot and the perception of puruṣa as the process is the same.")

 Answer—There is no defect in this. The puruṣa is not pervaded by the mind as in the case of the pot. The external pot and so on, is pervaded by the mind but not puruṣa as it is limitless (infinite).

 The mind is limited and by taking on puruṣa as object it cannot pervade that infinite subject. If it pervades puruṣa then it will also pervade [pradhāna.](http://# "Since the mind is an effect of pradhāna it cannot do this. Hence the argument fails.")

 तस्माद्यथा दर्पणे मुखं छायारूपेण गृह्यते, तथा पुरुषच्छायाकारेण परिणतः प्रत्ययो गृह्यते पुरुषेण। तथा च व्यासः 'यथाऽऽदर्शतलप्रख्ये पश्यत्यात्मानमात्मनि'॥ इति।

 न तु मुक्तान्यपुरुषाकारेण परिणतौ द्वारमस्ति। यदि तदाकारेण परिणमेत, मुक्तस्यापि तत्स्वमेवेति दृश्यं स्यात्। न हि चित्तस्य परिणामादन्यत्वं नामास्ति। स्वाकारेण हि परिणतं पुरुषो न तु चित्तं न पश्यति। स्वपुरुषे स्वत्वात्सति संबन्धे परिणतिद्वारमस्ति॥

 Therefore just as one perceives the face in a mirror in the form of a reflection, similarly the idea which has culminated in the form of a reflection of puruṣa is perceived by puruṣa. Thus Vyāsa says 'As in the clearness of a mirror, one sees the self in the [self.](http://# "The source of this reference is from Trevor Leggett's Vivaraṇa, p. 154, MBh, Śāntiparva, 204.8.")'

 There is no way for the mind to take on the form of another liberated puruṣa; even if it is that of a liberated one it will be seen as one's own. There is nothing other than the transformation of the mind. Puruṣa does not fail to perceive the mind changed into its own form. When there is the relationship of being the property to one's own puruṣa there is the possibility of this transformation.

कथं तर्हि स्वपुरुषादन्यस्य स्वत्वासंबन्धिनो ग्रहणम्—उच्यते—यथा परदर्पणद्वारेण परमुखदर्शनं,तथा दर्पणस्थानीयपरसत्वाकारपरिणतं स्वसत्वं पुरुषः पश्यन् परमपि पुरुषं जानाति॥



 तस्यायमात्मा ममायमित्यन्यत्वन्त्वनुमानादेव प्रतिपद्यते स्वकीयादन्यदीयसत्वगतविशेषलिङ्गेन।सत्वानां च त्रिगुणत्वादवश्यं विशेषाः सन्ति। पुरुषाणां तु निर्विशेषत्वात्स्वरूपेण भेदो दुरवबोध एव।

 Objection—Then how can another puruṣa different from one's own (puruṣa) which has no relationship of being the owner be [accepted.](http://# "The very existence of another person other than oneself becomes suspect in such a situation.")

 Answer—

Just as one can see another face through another mirror similarly puruṣa, seeing the transformation of one's own mind into the form of another mind which is like the second mirror, comes to know another puruṣa also.

 But the distinction like 'This is his self’, ‘This is mine', comes about by inference through the special indicatory mark belonging to a mind different from one's own. Minds composed of the three [qualities](http://# "They are composed of sattva, rajas and tamas.")necessarily have special properties. But as puruṣas have no properties they cannot be thought of as being different by nature.

 तस्मादेवमभिजातमणिकल्पस्य चेतसो ग्रहीतृग्रहणग्राह्येषु पुरुषेन्द्रियभूतेषु तत्स्थतदञ्जनता।तेषु ग्रहीत्रादिषु तिष्ठतीति तत्स्थं तत्स्थताविशिष्टा या ग्रहीत्राद्यञ्जनता,तदेवाह —

तेषु स्थितस्य तदाकारापत्तिः समापत्तिरित्युच्यते॥

 सम्यगापत्तिः समापत्तिः सा च तादृशी प्रत्यस्तमितबहिर्वृत्तेरेव भवति। यद्यपि व्युत्थितचित्तस्यापि समापत्तिरस्ति।तथाऽपि सा न समीचीनतरा, रजस्तमोभ्यां चित्तसत्वस्यात्यन्ताभिभूतत्वादिति॥४१॥

 Thus, in this way, the mind like a precious gem, assumes the form of the object of support by attaining stability in it. That gaining of stability with reference to the knower, etc., and the assumption of the form of the knower,etc., qualified by that stability is described as "teṣu sthitasya tadākārāpattiḥ [samāpattirityucyate](http://# "VBh., under YS, I.41.")".

 Samāpatti is a total identification; and that is such which can only take place when there is complete absence of (any other) outside modification. Even though an active mind also has such identification still it is not a true state because the sattva-mind is completely under the control of rajas and tamas.

**तत्र शब्दार्थज्ञानविकल्पैः संकीर्णा सवितर्का समापत्तिः॥४२॥**

 Of these the 'samāpatti' accompanied by deliberation is mixed due to error regarding the word, its meaning and its idea; ( mixed due to confusing the word, its meaning and its idea as undistinguished from each other).

 तद्यथा गौरिति शब्दो गौरित्यर्थो गौरिति ज्ञानं इत्यविभागेन विभक्तानामपि ग्रहणं दृष्टम्।विभज्यमानाश्चान्ये शब्दधर्मा अन्ये अर्थधर्माः अन्ये विज्ञानधर्मा इत्येतेषां विभक्तः पन्थाः।तत्र समापन्नस्य योगिनो यो गवाद्यर्थः समाधिप्रज्ञायां समारूढः स चेच्छब्दार्थज्ञानविकल्पानुविद्ध उपावर्तते सा संकीर्णा समापत्तिः सवितर्का इत्युच्यते॥ ४२॥

 For example one finds that the understanding of the word 'cow', the intended-object 'cow', and the idea 'cow' though distinct from each other, are taken as undistinguished from each other.

 (In fact) these are distinguished from each other; the properties of words are of



one kind, the properties of the objects intended (meanings) are of another kind (and) the properties of the ideas are of another kind, thus their paths are divided.

 In this state,when an intended object like cow has entered the discernment in ‘samādhi' of a yogīwho has attained 'samāpatti',if that 'samāpatti' arises,tinged by error regarding word,meaning (and) idea, (then) that is said to be a mixed 'samāpatti' accompanied by deliberation.

 सैषा समापत्तिश्चतुष्टयी। तत्र प्रथमां समापत्तिं व्याचष्टे—

शब्दार्थज्ञानविकल्पैः सङ्कीर्णा सवितर्का समापत्तिः। शब्दश्चार्थश्च ज्ञानं च शब्दार्थज्ञानानि तेषां विकल्पाः शब्दार्थज्ञानविकल्पाः।ध्यातव्यालम्बनविषयैर्विकल्पैः संकीर्णा विमिश्रा इतरेतरप्रत्ययानुविद्धा सा संकीर्णसमापत्तिः॥

 This samāpatti is four fold. He explains the first samāpatti as *śabdārthajñānavikalpaiḥ saṅkīrṇā savitarkā samāpattiḥ.* The derivation of the word *śabdārthajñānavikalpāḥ* is as follows—

the word and its meaning and its idea is word, meaning and idea. The error regarding them is the error regarding the word, its meaning and its idea. That is *saṅkīrṇā**samāpatti* where*saṅkīrṇā*= there is a confusion, a mixing up of thoughts upon each other due to confusion as to the objects of support being meditated upon.

 ननु च शब्दार्थप्रत्यया इतरेतरव्यावृत्तस्वरूपाः,योगी चैकं वस्तु ध्येयत्वेनालम्बते शब्दमर्थं प्रत्ययं वा,तत्र कः शब्दार्थज्ञानविकल्पसङ्करः?॥

 एवमेवैतत्। तथाऽपि अयमेव संव्यवहारो लोके, यदुताविभागेन ग्रहणम्। तद्यथा गौरिति शब्दो गौरित्यर्थो गौरिति ज्ञानमित्यविभागेन लोके ग्रहणं दृष्टम्। एवं हि लोकः त्रयमपि गौरित्येव व्यपदिशति। तथाऽन्यतरग्रहणेऽवशिष्टयोरपि स्मृतिः॥

 Objection—

But then, the thoughts pertaining to the word, its meaning and its idea are by nature mutually exclusive and the yogīuses one object as a support for meditation whether it is the word, its meaning or the idea. So where is the confusion here regarding error in the word, its meaning and the idea.

 Answer—

That is the point. Even if it is so, this is how it is in the everyday world; i.e., it is grasped without making any distinction. Thus for example, one finds that in the world the understanding of the word 'cow', the intended-object 'cow', and the idea ‘cow', are understood as undistinguished from each [other.](http://# "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything to what Vyāsa says here.") In this way, in ordinary life, the word 'cow' is used for all the three (senses) and when one of them is grasped there is memory of the remaining two as well (without distinguishing them from each other).

 Objection — But then, the object (of meditation) is a thing as it is in itself.



 Answer—That is not so; because it isgrasped after knowing the convention regarding a word and its meaning.

 Objection—But then, even before the convention any general word can determine the [object.](http://# "Even before the association between the word and its meaning come into play.")

 Answer—That cannot be as there is still knowledge of many different [things.](http://# "Since there are so many things around even determining which one is to be meditated upon will involve knowing other things as well.")"[vivicyamānāścānye śabdadharmā](http://# "VBh. has 'vibhajyamānāśca' instead of ‘vivicyamānāśca'.")".The letter 'g' (in gauḥ) with high or mixed [intonation](http://# "The three intonations are high (udātta), low (anudātta) and mixed or lying in between (svarita) samāhāraḥ svaritaḥ.") being pronounced quickly, with average speed or slowly, are all grasped by the ear. They do not belong to the intended objects or to the ideas. Similarly "anye arthadharmāḥ" (the properties of the intended object are different) like the dewlap, tail, hump, hoof, horn, sight, touch and so on. So also "anye [pratyayadharmāḥ](http://# "VBh. as available today has jñānadharmāḥ, the bhāṣya in the Vivaraṇa has vijñānadharmāḥ but the Vivaraṇakāra uses pratyayadharmāḥ.")" (the properties of ideas are different) like being able to be known by puruṣa, being of the nature of knowledge, being able to cause subliminal-impressions and so on. These properties do not belong to the word or to the meaning. In truth, there is no confusion whatsoever between these properties. Therefore their “viviktaḥ [panthāsteṣām](http://# "The reading in VBh. is 'vibhaktaḥ' and not 'viviktaḥ'.")" = paths are different.

 In this state when an intended object has entered the discernment in samadhi of a yogīwho has attained [samāpatti](http://# "The VBh. has 'gavādyarthaḥ' whereas the Vivaraṇa has 'hyevārthaḥ'. Instead of samādhiprajñāyām samārūḍhaḥ in VBh. the Vivaraṇa has samādhiprajñām upārūdhaḥ.")” “sa...nuviddhaḥ” = if that arises tinged by memory of the separate aspects which is induced by the convention obtaining between word and its [meaning](http://# "Memory of the convention will then lead to the false mental construction of the object of meditation.") then that is "sā sankīrṇā...ityucyate" = said to be mixed samāpatti accompanied by deliberation.

 Because of being qualified by latent-impressions of the knowledge of the convention between word and meaning in many births the first samāpatti of the yogīis the same as the idea as is prevalent in the world. There is only this difference that, because the mind of the yogīhas attained stability there is a flow of similar ideas (in his case).

 निर्वितर्कायाः समापत्तेरस्याः सूत्रेण लक्षणं द्योत्यते—

 When again memory is purified from the remembrance of the conventional use of words, and the discernment of 'samādhi' is free from error (in the form of) ideas either of inferences or of something that has been heard (from scriptures), the intended object stays only as itself and is characterised by having a form which is its own form alone; and this is the super-deliberative (nirvitarka) balanced state. This is the superior-perception. It is the seed of inference and the scriptures. From this, inference and the scriptures come into being.This percepton is not accompanied by the ideas of inference or by anything that has been heard. Therefore the yogī's knowledge, arising from the super-deliberative balanced state, is unmixed with any other source of valid knowledge.

 The nature of this super-deliberative balanced state is indicated by the (following) sūtra:

स्मृतिपरिशुद्धौ स्वरूपशून्येवार्थमात्रनिर्भासा निर्वितर्का॥४३॥

 When memory is purified, the shining of the object alone (in the mind), which appears as if it is not there, is the super-deliberative (balanced state).

 या शब्दसङ्केतश्रुतानुमानज्ञानविकल्पस्मृतिपरिशुद्धौ ग्राह्यस्वरूपोपरक्ता प्रज्ञास्वमिव प्रज्ञास्वरूपं ग्रहणात्मकं त्यक्त्वा पदार्थमात्रस्वरूपा ग्राह्यस्वरूपापन्नेव भवति। सा तदा निर्वितर्का समापत्तिः। तथा च व्याख्यातम्।

 तस्या एकबुद्ध्युपक्रमो ह्यर्थात्मा अणुप्रचयविशेषात्मा गवादिर्घटादिर्वा लोकः। स च संस्थानविशेषो भूतसूक्ष्माणां साधारणो धर्मः आत्मभूतः फलेन व्यक्तेनानुमितः स्वव्यञ्जकाञ्जनः प्रादुर्भवति। धर्मान्तरस्य कपालादेरुदये च तिरोभवति। स एष धर्मोऽवयवीत्युच्यते। योऽसावेकश्च महांश्चाणीयांश्च स्पर्शवांश्च क्रियाधर्मकश्चानित्यश्च तेनावयविना व्यवहाराः नियन्ते।

 When memory is purified from the error of the ideas of conventional meaning of words that have been heard or are in the form of inference, the intelligence (of the balanced state) is tinged by the nature of the object (of support); (then) abandoning, as it were, itself, which is the essence of intelligence of the nature of knowing, it becomes one with the true nature of the object (of support), as if it has attained the form of the object. Then that is the super-deliberative balanced state. (The bhāṣya, according to some, ends here.)

 Thus it has been explained—

the object of support (loka) of this (super-deliberative balanced state) such as a cow or such as a pot, gives rise to a single idea (like 'this is a pot'), its essence is an object and its essence is that of a special kind of conglomeration of atoms.

 And this particular kind of arrangement (which is the object such as a cow) is the common property of the subtle elements, which is inferred by the phenomenalized individual (object); risen from itself (ātmabhūtaḥ) it appears (in its individual form) when the conditions for its manifestation unfolds itself; when another property like the piece of pot (potsherd) arises it (the earlier property like the pot) disappears.



 This same property is called a whole. And this is one and big and small and tangible and one in which actions take place and (which is) impermanent. With this (kind of) whole the work in the world is carried on.

 यस्य पुनरवस्तुकः स प्रचयविशेषः,सूक्ष्मञ्च कारणमनुपलभ्यं अविकल्पस्य तस्य अवयव्यभावात् अतद्रूपप्रतिष्ठं मिथ्याज्ञानमिति प्रायेण सर्वमेव प्राप्तं मिथ्याज्ञानमिति।

 To such a person for whom, this special conglomeration is not real and (to whom) the subtle cause is (also) imperceptible (there is only) false knowledge based on a form not its own, because of the non-existence of a whole. (Thus) nearly everything is reduced to false knowledge.Then, since there is the non-existence of (whole) objects, what would be right knowledge? Whatever is perceived, is perceived as being a whole. Therefore,(it can be said that ) a whole exists, which being connected with sizes and the like is the object of the super-deliberative balanced state.

 इदानीं निर्वितर्का समापत्तिरुच्यते। यदा पुनः शब्दसङ्केतस्मृतिपरिशुद्धौ।शब्दसङ्केतोऽस्यायं वाचकः अयमस्य वाच्य इति समयप्रतिपत्तिः। तज्जनितस्मृतिः शब्दसङ्केतस्मृतिः। तस्याः परिशुद्धिर्मिथ्या त्वाद्विनिवृत्तिः। सा रजस्तमसोर्न्यग्भावात्

 He now mentions nirvitarkā samāpatti (through the words)"yadā punaḥ śabda-sanketasmṛtipariśuddhau" and so on. Convention related to a word is the general understanding of the rule that 'this is the expression for that and that is the meaning of this expression'.The memory which is produced by it is the memory of verbal convention. Its purification is the cessation of [error](http://# "The purification of memory."); and that is due to overcoming rajas and tamas.

**** श्रुतज्ञानं आगमिकम्,अनुमानज्ञानं लैङ्गिकं,ते च सामान्यविषय एवानुमानागमज्ञाने,तयोर्विकल्पो हि विशेषाध्यारोपः तेनाध्यासेन शून्यायां योगिनः समाधिप्रज्ञायां व्यावृत्तलैङ्गिकसाङ्केतिकज्ञानाध्यासायां स्वरूपमात्रेण मात्रग्रहणं दिग्देशकालानुभावादिभ्योऽपि व्यावृत्त इत्येवमर्थं,स्वैरेव धर्मैर्महीयमानः तत्स्वरूपमात्रतयैव तस्यार्थस्य स्वरूपमात्रतयैव योगिनः प्रज्ञा अवच्छिद्यते।न तस्मादर्थाद्बहिर्देशकालादि किंचिदालोचयतीत्यर्थः॥

 Knowledge that is heard is from the scriptures, knowledge that is inference is from indicatory marks; and scriptural and inferential knowledge both deal only with (universals). The error is the superimposition of particular qualities to them.[^668]When the yogī's discernment in samādhi is free from that superimposition i.e., free from superimpositions of inferential and conventional knowledge, then the object stays glorified by its own qualities;“svarūpamātreṇa" = the word "mātra” is to show the exclusion from such things as space, location, time,experience, etc.,“tatsvarūpamātratayaivāvacchidyate" = the insight of the yogīis limited only to the true nature of the object;it does not deliberate on anything outside of the object like space, time, etc.

[^668]: "Forgetting their general import memory does this."



 स्वमपि ग्रहणात्मकं रूपं तत्प्रज्ञा नालोचयति, निर्मलतरत्वात्। ग्राह्यमात्रैव सा विभाव्यते।सा च तादृशी निर्वितर्का समापत्तिः। र्निर्गतो वितर्कोऽस्याः निर्वितर्क वितर्कोऽध्यारोपः। सोऽस्यां नास्ति॥

 This insight is not aware of itself as of the essence of knowledge as it is absolutely pure. It appears only as the object; and that is “nirvitarkā samāpattiḥ".That from which deliberation is removed is nirvitarkaḥ, vitarka is superimposition, that is absent in this (nirvitarkā). "tat" = this "param pratyakṣam" = is superior pure, direct perception. The lower perception is common to all and has been mentioned earlier under the modifications; this only belongs to a yogī.


“[tacchrutānumānayorbījam](http://# "The VBh. has 'tacca' whereas the Vivaraṇa has just 'tat'.")". Though the earlier mentioned (perception) is also the basis of both scriptural and inferential [knowledge](http://# "YS, I.7, and VBh. on it.")still, scriptures and inference which are its effects are uncertain (faulty); but when direct perception arises due to nirvitarkā-samādhi there is no error whatsoever. Thus he (Vyāsa) says "tataḥŚrutānumāne prabhavataḥ".

 न च ( ननु ) श्रुतानुमानज्ञानसहभूतं तद्दर्शनम्, श्रुतानुमानज्ञानाभ्यामसमानविषयमित्येतत्। विशेषविषयं हि तद्दर्शनं, सामान्यविषये श्रुतानुमानज्ञाने। तस्मादसङ्कीर्णं प्रमाणान्तरेण योगिनो निर्वितर्कजं दर्शनमिति (तन्निर्वितर्कायाः तदिति तस्मादिति)समापत्तेरस्याः सूत्रेण लक्षणं द्योत्यते—

 And "na ca śrutānumānajñānasahabhūtam taddarśanam” = its object is different from the knowledge got through the scriptures and through inference. That knowledge is of the particular object; whereas scriptural and inferential knowledge deal with general properties. "tasmādasankīrṇam...darśanam... [dyodyate](http://# "The Vivaraṇa does not add anything new here.")".


"[tannirvitarkāyāḥ](http://# "VBh. has only nirvitarkāyāḥ . . . and not tannirvitarkāyāḥ.")”.Thus the nature of this super-deliberative balanced state is indicated by the sūtra smṛtipariśuddhau svarūpaśūnyevārthamātranirbhāsānnirvitarkā.

 "śabdasaṅketaśrutānumānajñānavikalpasmṛtipariśuddhau". Memory is that which has error due to verbal convention, error due to scriptural knowledge and error due to inferential knowledge. It is due to memory that one superimposes the quality of one object on another object, as an object by itself cannot be projected as something else.

 ननु च कथं श्रुतानुमिते प्रत्यक्षेऽध्यारोप्येते। ननु च प्रसिद्धोऽध्यारोपः, तथा चेदं मया श्रुतमिदं मयाऽनुमितमिदमिति च पश्यति॥

 ननु तदेव तत् दृश्यमानमपि यदनुमितं श्रुतं च—

न —

सामान्यविशेषभेदात्। सामान्यं श्रुतमनुमितं च।



विशेषस्तु प्रत्यक्षस्य विषयः। तस्मिंश्च तत्सामान्याध्यासः प्रसिद्ध एव॥

 Objection—

But then, how can what is heard and inferred be superimposed on something perceived directly.

 Answer — But on the other hand, superimposition is also well-known ([in the world)](http://# "To use 'nanu' to begin a reply is rather unusual when the pūrvapakṣin has already stated his objection with 'nanu' himself.").Thus one says 'I have heard this,' 'I have inferred this,' thus it is seen as this (now).

 Objection—

But then, even if it is seen, it is only that which has been inferred and heard about.

 Answer—

That is not so, due to the distinction between generality and particularity. That which is heard and inferred is the general whereas the particular is the object of direct perception. And the superimposition of the universal on to that (particular) is well-known indeed.

 "grāhyoparaktā ... [bhavati](http://# "VBh. has ‘grāhyasvarūpoparaktā' whereas Vivaraṇa has grāhyoparaktā'. The ‘iva' after 'svaṃ' in the VBh. has been dropped in the Vivaraṇa. 'prajñāsvarūpam' in the VBh. becomes 'prajñārūpam' in the Vivaraṇa. 'padārthamātrasvarūpā' in the VBh. becomes 'padārthamātrasvabhāvā' in the Vivaraṇa. The Vivaraṇa does not add any new explanation to the bhāṣya.")".Through the word "[iva](http://# "In the word ‘grāhyasvarūpāpanneva'.")" he mentions that it (the mind) does not give up its nature of knowing. For instance a crystal does not give up its purity (transparency) when any object is placed near [it](http://# "The crystal takes on, as it were, the colour of the proximate object but does not lose its inherent nature.").Moreover, what is being said is that there is another object which is grasped different from the process of knowing. That is the super-deliberative balanced [state](http://# "According to some the bhāṣya ends here."). It is thus explained.

 “tasya [hyekabuddhyupakramo'rthātmā](http://# "The bhāṣya has 'ekabuddhyupakramo hyarthātmā', whereas the Vivaraṇa has hyekabuddhyupakramo'rthātmā'.")”.That which arises due to a single idea is "ekabuddhyupakramaḥ" i.e.,determined by a single idea. "arthātmā" = (an object) of the nature of being known.

 गवादिर्घटादिर्वा विषयः न तु बोध एव गवाद्याकारो विषयः। अणुप्रचयविशेषात्मा अणूनां तन्मात्रावयवानां प्रचयविशेष आत्मा यस्य स गवादिर्घटादिर्वा आलम्बनं बुद्धेः स च विषयः संस्थानविशेषः तथा संस्थितानि हि तानि भूतसूक्ष्माणि॥

 एतदुक्तं भवति—

भूतसूक्ष्माणां साधारणो धर्म इति आत्मभूतो न व्यतिरिक्तः। यथा सर्पस्य आभोगकुण्डलनादि॥

 The object is something like a cow, a pot, etc., and knowledge itself is not in the



form of a cow and so [on](http://॑॑# "Unlike the Buddhist Vijñānavādin who subscribes to this view."). “aṇupracayaviśeṣātmā"=that whose essence is a special kind of conglomeration of atoms, i.e.,parts of subtle elements.A cow, a pot, etc., is the support of the mind and that object is a particular kind of arrangement of the subtle elements.

 Thus it is said that [this](http://# "This particular arrangement.") is the common property of the subtle elements of its own essence and not different from them just like the hood, coils, etc., are not different from the snake.

 येषां पुनरत्यन्तव्यतिरिक्तमन्यदेव कारणात् कार्यं तेषां कारणतन्त्रत्वं कार्यस्य न प्राप्नोति।अंशुतन्त्रो हि तन्तुः तन्तुतन्त्रश्च पटः।न चात्यन्तान्यत्वेऽन्यतन्त्रत्वं दृष्टमन्यस्य। यथा मृत्पिण्डतन्त्रता न पटस्य, तन्तूनां वा॥

 किञ्च—

तद्विनाशानुविनाशित्वं च न शक्यं, न हि कपालविनाशमनुविनश्यति पटः॥

 As for those who hold that the effect is absolutely different from the [cause](http://# "A reference perhaps to the asatkāryavāda of the Naiyāyika.") they cannot explain the dependency of the effect on the cause. The thread is dependent on the fine filaments (which make it) and the cloth is dependent on the threads. When two things are absolutely different, then it is not seen that one of them is dependent on the other. Thus cloth is not dependent on a lump of clay nor are the threads.

 Moreover—

it is not destroyed along with the destruction of the other.Thus cloth does not follow the destruction of the potsherd.

 अथोच्येत, सम्बन्धः कारणमिति। पटस्य हि तन्तवस्तन्तूनाञ्चांशव इति सम्बन्धस्तत्र हेतुः कारणं तत्तन्त्रत्वतदनुविनाशयोरिति॥

 अत्रोच्यते — चैत्रक्षेत्रादिसम्बन्धेऽपि प्रसङ्गःस्यात्। चैत्रस्यापि क्षेत्रादितन्त्रता तदनुविनाशित्वं च सम्बन्धविशेषात् प्रसज्येत॥

अथापि स्यात्—

समवायलक्षणः सम्बन्धः कारणमिति—

न—

तस्यापि संबन्धत्वाविशेषादहेतुत्वं,यथान्यसंबन्धः संबन्धिनोरन्यतरतन्त्रत्वाद्यहेतुः एवं समवायलक्षणस्यापि संबन्धत्वादन्यतरतन्त्रत्वादावहेतुत्वम्॥

 Objection—

Then it is said that relationship is the cause. The threads are related to the cloth and the fine filaments to the threads. Thus relationship is the cause (of the effect). It is the cause for dependence and for [destruction](http://# "Relation is the cause for the origin and for destruction.").

 Answer—

This will apply incorrectly to the relation between Caitra and his field. Thus the dependence of Caitra on the fields, etc., will mean his destruction when the fields are destroyed.

 Objection—

Then it can mean that cause is the relation called inherence.

 Answer—That cannot be as that (inherence) is also not different from being a relation; therefore it cannot be the cause. Just as other relationships are not causes because of mutual dependence of the relata similarly, inherence being a relationship is not a cause in the dependence, etc., of one upon another.

 अपि च न द्रव्यव्यतिरेकेण कर्मसामान्यविशेषसमवायाः सन्ति। द्रव्यतन्त्रत्वाद्युपपत्तेरेव।तत्रापि सम्बन्धस्याप्यहेतुत्वमेव॥

 किञ्चान्यत्—

संबन्धस्य च संबन्धिनोरेवान्यतरतन्त्रत्वादिहेतुत्वे समवायस्यापि समवायान्तरं तस्याप्यन्य



इत्यनवस्था प्रसज्येत। यथा गुणादीनां समवायलक्षणात् संबन्धात् द्रव्यतन्त्रत्वं, तथा समवायस्यापि द्रव्यव्यतिरिक्तत्वे द्रव्यतन्त्रत्वार्थं समवायान्तरं कल्प्येत, तस्याप्यन्यत्तस्याप्यन्यदित्यनवस्था स्यात्॥

 Moreover inherence of action, universal properties and particular characteristics cannot exist apart from a [substance](http://# "It is only in a substance can all these inhere."),as they are obtained only as dependent on a substance. Even there relation has no causality.

 Moreover there is another reason. If a relation has causality of mutual dependence of the two relata then there has to be another (second) inherence for the first inherence and another for that (second) and so on ad infinitum. Just as qualities are dependent on substances due to the relationship of inherence similarly since inherence also is different from the substance, in order to make it dependent on the [substance](http://# "Inherence is a separate substance according to Nyāya-Vaiseṣika.")one has to imagine a second inherence; then again another for that second and again another for that (third) and thus there will be infinite regress.

 प्रागुत्पत्तेरभावात् कार्यस्य कारणेन संबन्धानुपपत्तिः,अविशिष्टं चासत्वं शशविषाणस्य घटस्य च। तत्र घटेनैव कारणस्य संबन्धो न शशविषाणादिभिरिति हेतुर्वदितव्यः॥

 प्राक् असन्नोत्पद्येत शशविषाणवत्। यस्तु तन्तुभ्योऽन्यः स तन्तुभ्यो नोत्पद्यते, तन्तुभ्योऽन्यत्वात्। यथा तन्तुभ्यो घटः॥

 As the effect is non-existent before its coming into being it can have no relation with the cause; the non-existence of a rabbit's horn and of a pot are not different. There is relationship of the cause with a pot only and not with a rabbit's horns, etc., the reason for this is to be [explained](http://# "As non-existence of any substance is just plain and simple absence one may as well talk of the cause of a rabbit's horm, a pot, cloth or anything else. It will make no difference whatsoever. But one does not talk of causes for things which do not exist like a rabbit's horns.").

 Just like a rabbit's horn what is non-existent before cannot come into existence. That which is different from threads cannot come into being from threads as it is different from threads; as for instance a pot from threads.

 इतर आह—प्राक् सन्नपि नोत्पद्येत, सत्वात्, विद्यमानघटवदिति।यो यस्मादनन्यः सोऽपि तस्मान्नोत्पद्यते, विद्यमानत्वात्, स्वरूपवदिति॥

अपर आह—यदि सन्नोत्पद्यत इति सत उत्पत्त्यभाव उच्येत, सिद्धसाध्यता स्यात्।अथाभिव्यक्त्यभावः,तदा दृष्टान्ताभावः॥

यदप्युच्यते यो यस्मादनन्य इति तत्रापि सिद्धसाध्यता दृष्टान्ताभावश्च।स्वरूपादेव ह्यभिव्यज्यते, नासत्यभिव्यङ्गयस्वरूपेऽभिव्यक्तिरभिव्यञ्जकसहस्रेणापि शक्यते कर्तुम् ॥

 Objection—Another one says, even that which is existent before cannot come into existence, as it is (already) existent like a pot which is existent now. That which is identical with something else also cannot come into existence from that as it is already existent, like its own self.

 Answer—If it is said that the existent does not come into existence so there is no coming into existence of the existent then there will be the fallacy of proving some-



thing already [established](http://# "Existent things are already in the world. So one is trying to prove what is already present before one's eyes.").Then there will be absence of manifestation (of objects) and there will be absence of any [example](http://# "In any logical syllogism, to prove one's point, there has to be an example cited both for and against, like the kitchen and lake in the case of smoke and fire. If nothing comes into being there can be no examples and one cannot prove one's point through reasoning.").

 In the case of something which is identical with something else not coming into being, there also is the fallacy of proving something already established and the absence of any example. A thing is manifested by its own nature; in case there is absence of the nature to be manifested then there can be no manifestation even with a thousand manifesting factors.

 किञ्चान्यत्—सर्वव्यवहारलोपश्च। कथं? यदा देवदत्तस्य गौरश्वो वा प्रातर्विद्यमानकर्णलाङ्गूलः पुनरटवीं गतः केनचिल्लूनकर्णो लूनलाङ्गूलो वा स्यात्,तदा पूर्वावयवविभागाद्विनष्टः,अन्यस्तु नवः प्रलूनकर्णलाङ्गूलोऽस्वामिकः सञ्जात इति येन केनचिदुपादीयेत, तथा चावयवविभागः सर्वत्र सम्भवतीति स्वस्वामिसम्बन्धादिनियमाभावादशेषव्यवहारलोपः स्यात्॥

 Moreover, there will be a disappearance of ordinary day-to-day activity in the world. How so? If the cow or horse of Devadatta seen in the morning having ears and tail goes to the forest (for grazing) and has its ears or tail cut off then, because of separation from its earlier parts, it is destroyed and another new one with ears and tail cut off is born, which has no owner; therefore anyone can take it (as his). In that case separation of parts (of things) will occur everywhere and in the absence of the rule of relationship between the owner and the owned, etc., there will be a total disappearance of worldly transaction.

अथ ब्रूयात्—पूर्वोपार्जितावयवैरेवावयवी नवः प्रलूनकर्णलाङ्गूल आरब्ध इति—नैवम्—न हि मातापित्रादिव्यतिरेकेणेदानीन्तनलूनकर्णलाङ्गूलावयव्यन्तरप्रत्यारम्भिणो दृश्यन्ते॥

 किंच— यस्य च क्षेत्रे लूनकर्णलाङ्गूलो जातस्तस्यैवासौ स्यात्, न पूर्वावयविकस्य, तत्क्षेत्रजाततृण-पलाशादिवत्॥

 यथा चान्यक्षेत्रगतानि बीजानि सलिलौघेनान्यक्षेत्रमुपनीतानि चेत्तत्तद्बीजनिष्पन्नसस्यं क्षेत्रवानेव गृह्णाति,न तु पूर्वबीजवान् (तः)। न चास्यासौ प्रतिबध्नाति विद्वानपि मदीयबीजपरिनिष्पन्नं सस्यमहमुपादीयेति॥

 तथा लूनकर्णलाङ्गूलमपि क्षेत्रवानेव गृह्णीत। न तत्र प्रतिबन्ध(रूप) नीयम्मदीयावयवैरारब्धोऽयमवयवीति॥

 Objection—Then it can be said that the new whole (animal) with ears and tail cut off has come into being only through the earlier parts already acquired.

 Answer—That is not so; one does not see the creators of these different wholes instantly with ears and tail cut off, without father and mother and so on.

 Moreover, the animal without ears and tail belongs to him in whose land it is born and not to one who owned the earlier whole animal just as the grass, palāśa tree, etc., which grow on that land.

 If seeds from one field are carried by flood water to another field then the corn which grow from those seeds are taken by the one owning that latter field and not by the one who owned the earlier seeds. No one, not even a learned man can dispute this saying that 'I know that the corn has grown from my seeds so I would take it.'



 Similarly the animal with the ears and tail cut off will be taken by the one who owns the land (where the animal is found); he cannot be prevented by saying that this whole animal has come into being through the earlier parts belonging to him.

 येषामप्येकस्मिन्गृहीते तस्मिन्नश्वे लूनकर्णलाङ्गूलके जाते स्वक्षेत्रे च दृष्टे स एवाश्वदाता अन्योयं (वितिसन्योयं) महत्तमादश्वान्मया दत्तो महत्तम इति हरेत। हरतामिति चेत्सर्वव्यवहारलोपप्रसङ्गः शास्त्रकोपश्च। तस्माद\[नन्योऽ\]वयवेभ्यः कारणेभ्य एकोऽवयवी कार्यमिति सिद्धम्॥

 Again when the horse with ears and tail cut off, born on his land, is seen by him and is taken by him another who has done the cutting can say that he has produced that great horse from another greater horse and will claim it. If it is given to [him](http://# "If it is given to the one who has done the cutting of the ears and the tail.")there will be the collapse of all ordinary dealings and it will also contradict the scriptures. Therefore it is established that the effect is a single whole caused by many parts.

 यदप्युच्यते—

 The statement that the effect is different due to difference between word, idea and properties, etc., is also not [correct](http://# "The cause and effect are described differently and have different properties. "). Even when there is difference in word, etc., (describing them) it is seen that they are not different. Thus the same object is called by different words as hastaḥ, karaḥ, pāṇiḥ, [etc](http://# "These different words describe the same object.").,the same person is thought of at different times as being a father and a son and the same person can be bound and then freed, staying in one place and having gone [away](http://# "These different ideas refer to the same person."). The capacity to burn and the capacity to cook, etc., are different [properties](http://# "These different properties are of the same object."). Differences of direction and place, etc., are not conclusive ([proofs](http://# "One cannot use them as conclusive proofs for conclusions.")). Therefore he (Vyāsa) says “ātmabhūtāḥ” and so on.

 And that is “[svaphalena vyaktenānumitaḥ](http://# "VBh. has 'phalena' whereas Vivarana has svaphalena'.")”;“phalena" = by carrying and holding water, etc., (in case of a pot). That whose result, effect is available in a manifest form,certainly exists. “anumitaḥ” is used with reference to many, mutually connected [ideas](http://# "Sometimes the manifest object can give rise to many different opinions regarding its true nature."); i.e., with reference to its common property or with reference to its powers. It is directly perceived (at present ) by its result, its effect called a pot, but is inferred as



existing earlier in an unmanifest form in the state of clay and made manifest through the action of agencies (causes) like a potter, his staff and string. That same pot is now manifest through its manifesting causes like staff, etc., "dharmāntarodaye..."= and disappears when another quality appears."sa eṣa... tyucyate" (This same property) of the subtle elements (is called a [whole](http://# "Coming into being, disappearing, being in a latent state and so on, all make up the object in this system as it believes in 'satkāryavāda'.")).

 किञ्च—

अमी अप्यन्ये हेतवोऽवयविसद्भावे—

योऽसावेकश्च महांश्चाणीयांश्च क्रियाधर्मकश्चानित्यश्च। प्रत्येकमेते हेतवः॥

 It is said that since the minutest atoms are imperceptible it is not correct to speak of appearance and disappearance ([of objects](http://# "As they cannot be perceived it is meaningless to talk of objects in these terms.")). But they do happen. Therefore that which appears also disappears when another property comes into being as it is contradictory (to it). That which depends on manifesting factors for its appearance is called "so' vayavītyucyate" = a whole. And that of this characteristic is different from the atoms.

 Moreover, there are these other causes in (for) the existence of the whole i.e.,"yo' sāvekaśca ... [nityaśca](http://# "The Vivaraṇa just repeats the bhāṣya without adding anything new. The word 'sparśavānśca' is missing from the Vivaraṇa-perhaps a mistake on the part of the scribe.")”.These are causes separate from each other.

 अपि च—

एको घट इति घटशब्दवाच्यस्यैकत्वेन सामानाधिकरण्यात्।अस्ति चेदं सामानाधिकरण्यं योऽसावेक इति।न हि बहूनामणूनामेकत्वेन सामानाधिकरण्यमुपकल्पते॥

 Moreover, in the expression 'one pot' the meaning denoted by the word 'pot' has the same relationship to oneness (denoted by the word one). This same relationship is there in the expression 'that one is this'. But in the case of many atoms the same relationship to oneness is not there.

 So also with size. Atoms which are without size do not have the same relationship with something with size; so also (its relationship) with something which is minute (is not the same). It is not correct to say that in relationship to other atoms the atoms are small; after all they are all atoms. Again the minuteness of the atoms is not known from the (other) atoms but in the case of minuteness the smallness of other objects will be the reason (for knowing it).

 Moreover “kriyādharmakaśca". That which has action as a property is “kriyādharmakaḥ". It is said that it (function ) has a result which is accomplished by action. Atoms do not have (any) function (result) which is accomplished by action, as they cannot be used by people like [us](http://# "Atoms are imperceptible."). Moreover results (substances) are impermanent whereas atoms are not so.

 Moreover they are seen whereas atoms are not seen. Similarly they are tangible, they can be left alone or obtained or held and so on. (With this whole, worldly life goes on) and not with atoms.

 यस्य पुनः इत्थं प्रमाणसुप्रसिद्धसत्ताकोऽपि अवस्तु \[कः\] अवयवी, स प्रचयविशेषः सूक्ष्मं च कारणमनुपलभ्यं अण्वादि, तस्यावयव्यभावादतद्रूपप्रतिष्ठं मिथ्याज्ञानमिति प्रायेण सर्वमेव विषयज्ञानं प्राप्तं मिथ्याज्ञानम्॥

ततश्च प्रत्यक्षानुमानयोरप्याभासत्वमेव तेनाभ्युपेतं तयोरपि शब्दादिविषयत्वात्॥

 

If such a whole which has an existence well-known through sources of valid knowledge is denied as real because "sa pracayaviśeṣaḥsūkṣmam ca kāraṇamanupalabhyam”=the atoms which are the subtle causes are not perceived then (to him) "tasyāvayavyabhāvādatadrūpapratiṣṭham mithyājñānamiti prāyeṇa sarvameva prāptam mithyājñānam" = all objective knowledge is false. All knowledge whether it is in the form of sound, etc., or in the form of [pleasure](http://# "All external sense-experiences and internal sense-experiences are covered by these two terms.")
and so on,are obtained in the form of knowledge. Sound and so on,are considered wholes which take on the form of knowledge but are not real.Even pleasure and so on,being objects (of experiences), also belong to the category of wholes. As their knowledge is assumption of the form of knowledge it follows that its nature is false and thus everything is [false](http://# "This is the Vijñānavādin's viewpoint.").

 

And thus the false appearance (falsity) of perception and inference follows from that, as they also have objects like sound and so on.

 यदपि सर्वज्ञज्ञानमनित्यदुःखशून्यानात्मकत्वादिविषयं तस्यापि विषयाभावात्तदपि मिथ्याज्ञानं प्राप्तमिति, स्वतन्त्रस्य तीर्थकरस्य चाप्रामाण्यं, तत्र तीर्थकरसहधर्माभावश्चाभ्युपगतो भवति। शब्दादिवत्प्रमाणविषयत्वाविशेषात्॥

And the knowledge of the omniscient one (Buddha) having objects that are impermanent, painful, empty and without any essence is also without any [object](http://# "As there is no outside object different from the mind.");and since



that has no object that will also be false knowledge; then the words of the free Arhat will be without any authority and thus there will be no connection between the Arhat and his duties (preachings) since the objects of valid knowledge are not different from objects like sound and so [on](http://# "Thus he attacks the Buddhist doctrine.").

 Thus he indicates "samyagjñānamapi... nāghrātamiti". Knowledge is not different from the form of that which is presented to it. But (the Buddhist) does not accept any object which lends its form to it (knowledge); thus all knowledge which has its own form is rendered false by [him](http://# "The object also being provided by knowledge in the Vijñānavāda view is not correct, says he.").

 तथा च सम्यग्ज्ञानमपि किं स्यात्, यदपेक्षया मिथ्याज्ञानमभिसन्धीयते॥

 यदा चावयविनं सर्वप्रमाणसम्यक्सर्वज्ञानसिद्धमपह्नुते तदा न सम्यग्ज्ञानस्य विषयः सम्पादयितुं पार्यते॥

 यदा च न पारयति,तदा कथमभिसन्दधीत सर्वं मिथ्येति। सम्यग्ज्ञानमपेक्ष्य मिथ्याज्ञानं मिथ्याभावमासीदति आपेक्षिकत्वात्सम्यङ्मिथ्याज्ञानयोः॥

 Then what would be right knowledge with reference to which one judges false knowledge? When one denies the whole which is established by the correct knowledge of [all](http://# "It is a matter of common knowledge and not of one person.")(people) and by all proofs then it is not possible to obtain any object for right knowledge. And when it is not obtained how can one judge that everything is false. False knowledge is with reference to correct knowledge, as when one says ‘it was false'; there is thus a mutual reference between correct and false knowledge.

 यश्चापि मन्यते—निर्विषयं ज्ञानं सम्यगिति,तस्यापि स्वरूपाग्रहणात् तदस्तित्वानुपपत्तिः।गृह्यते चेद्विषयत्वादवयविमिथ्यात्वं, तन्मिथ्यात्वाच्च तज्ज्ञानमिथ्यात्वं, तथा तज्ज्ञानमपीति सर्वमिथ्यात्वमुक्तं पूर्वमेव॥

 अथापि ब्रूयात्—यत्सविषयमिवाभाति तन्मिथ्याज्ञानं, यदत्यन्तनिर्विषयं तत्सम्यगिति। तथाऽपि तस्यास्तित्वे प्रमाणाभाव इत्युक्त एव दोषः। तस्मादवयवी सम्यग्ज्ञानस्य विषयोऽवश्याभ्युपगन्तव्यः इत्याह तस्मादस्त्यवयवी यो महत्वाद्व्यवहारापन्नः समापत्तेर्निर्वितर्काया विषयीभवतीति॥४३॥

  Objection—It can be said that right knowledge is knowledge without an object.

 Answer—But since there is no knowledge of its own nature its existence cannot be explained. If it is known then being an object it will be a false whole, and by its being false its knowledge will also be false and then its knowledge also (will be false) and thus everything will be false as already mentioned.

 Moreover if right knowledge is without object then the knowledge of all (people) not having any objects will be without objects and will be correct knowledge. In that case one has to explain what false knowledge will be as all knowledge will be right.

 Objection—One can say that what appears to have an object is false and what is absolutely without an object is correct.

 Answer—Even then there is the defect already mentioned that there is no proof for its existence. Therefore one has to definitely accept a whole as the object of correct (right) knowledge. Thus he says "tasmādastyavayavīyo mahattvā... viṣayībhavatīti".



**एतयैव सविचारा निर्विचारा च सूक्ष्मविषया व्याख्याता॥४४॥**

 By this (above-mentioned deliberative and super-deliberative balanced states) the reflective and super-reflective (balanced states) having subtle objects (as their support) have been explained.

** **तत्र भूतसूक्ष्मकेष्वभिव्यक्तधर्मकेषु देशकालनिमित्तानुभवावच्छिन्नेषु या समापत्तिः सा सविचारेत्युच्यते। तत्राप्येकबुद्धिनिर्ग्राह्यमेवोदितधर्मविशिष्टं भूतसूक्ष्ममालम्बनीभूतं समाधिप्रज्ञायामुपतिष्ठते। या पुनः सर्वथा सर्वतः शान्तोदिताव्यपदेश्यधर्मानवच्छिन्नेषु सर्वधर्मानुपातिषु सर्वधर्मात्मकेषु समापत्तिः सा निर्विचारेत्युच्यते। एवंस्वरूपं हि तद्भूतसूक्ष्ममेतेनैव स्वरूपेणालम्बनीभूतमेव समाधिप्रज्ञास्वरूपमुपरञ्जयति।

** **Between those two, that which refers to subtle elements having manifested properties and which are conditioned by an experience of place, time and cause, is the reflective. In that stage also, the support which is a subtle object, is present in the discernment of 'samādhi' as fit to be grasped through a single idea characterised by its manifested properties.

** **And that state-of-balance, which at all times and at all places is concerned with (subtle objects) unconditioned by the properties of past (śānta), present (udita) and future (avyapadeśya) (but) are the basis of all properties and are the essence of all properties, is called the super-reflective (nirvicārā).

** **

The subtle element is indeed of this nature (and) having become an object of support in this essential form it colours (uparañjayati) the discernment of 'samādhi'. When the discerning intelligence (prajñā) appears as devoid of its nature (of knowing) (and) (appears as) the object alone, then it is called super-reflective.

** **Amongst these stages, that having an object of magnitude (mahadvastu) as an object (of support) is the deliberative and the super-deliberative; and that having a subtle object as an object (of support) is the reflective and super-reflective. Thus, through this same super-deliberative (balanced state) the destruction of error in these two (reflective and super-reflective) has been explained.

** **एतयैव सविचारा निर्विचारा च सूक्ष्मविषया व्याख्याता। तत्र भूतसूक्ष्मेष्वभिव्यक्तधर्मकेषु तन्मात्रेष्वेव देशकालनिमित्तानुभवावच्छिन्त्रेषु देशावच्छिन्त्रेषु कालावच्छिन्त्रेषु निमित्तावच्छिन्नेष्वनुभवावच्छिन्नेष्विति प्रत्येकमवच्छिन्नशब्दः। सर्वं हि वस्तु देशादिभिरवच्छिद्यमानं विषयिणा ज्ञात्रा संबध्यमानं व्यवहाराय कल्पते। तेष्वेवंभूतेष्वेवंभूतैव देशादिविकल्पाभिसंहितैव या समापत्तिः सा सविचारेत्यच्यते। ततश्च सविचारायाः सवितर्काविशेषत्वं सिद्धम्॥

** ***etayaiva savicārānirvicārā sūkṣmaviṣayā vyākhyātā.* “tatra...vacchinneṣu” = in the subtle elements itself having manifested properties, which are conditioned by an experience of place, time, cause and experience—thus the word conditioned (avacchinna) is connected with each word. All objects, being conditioned by place, etc., and related to the subject, the knower, become fit for worldly experience. With



reference to such objects the *samāpatti* along with such wrong notions (misapprehensions) like place, etc., is called savicārā. Thus it is established that savicārā is not different from [savitarkā](http://# "In both there are qualifications or wrong attributes associated with the object, one being gross and the other subtle.").



कथम्? इहाप्यध्यासाविशेषात्। अयन्तु विशेषः शब्दसङ्केतार्थज्ञानदेशादिसर्वाध्यासाः सवितर्कायाम्॥

 

इह पुनस्तन्मात्रसूक्ष्मधर्मेषु शब्दसङ्केतस्याप्रसिद्धत्वाद्विशिष्टनामसङ्केतज्ञानानध्यासः देशाद्यध्यासश्च सूक्ष्मविषयत्वञ्चेति सवितर्काविशेषत्वसिद्धिः॥



तत्राप्येकबुद्धिनिर्ग्राह्यमेवोदितधर्मविशिष्टं उक्तदेशादिधर्मविशिष्टमुद्भूतधर्मविशिष्टं वा भूतसूक्ष्ममालम्बनीभूतं न तु निर्विषयं ज्ञानमेव समाधिप्रज्ञायामुपतिष्ठते।

** **

How is that so? Because here also there is no difference from superimposition. This is the only difference that in savitarka there is the superimposition of everything like verbal convention, meaning, idea, place and so [on](http://# "In savicārāthere is no superimposition of verbal convention of meaning and idea since it deals with subtle objects.").

** **

In this case, as verbal convention is not known with reference to subtle elements there is no superimposition of the convention of name, meaning and idea; but there is the superimposition of place, etc., and it has a subtle object (as support). Thus the non-difference from savitarkā has been [proved](http://# "By the arguments given earlier, supra, n. 1.").

** **

“tatrā...tiṣṭhate" = (the subtle object which is a support of savicārā) is qualified by the said characteristic of place, etc., or qualified by some manifest characteristic: it is not bare knowledge without any object that "samādhiprajñāyāmupatiṣṭhate" (is present in the samādhi insight).

"[yadā punaḥnavacchinneṣu](http://# "It is 'yā punah' in VBh. whereas in the  Vivaraṇa it is ‘yadā punaḥ'.")".“sarvathā = in all ways. “sarvataḥ” = at all places. The properties that are past, present and future are 'śāntoditāvyapadeśya-dharmāḥ'';not conditioned by them is “anavacchinneṣu”. “sāntaḥ” = The past is the quality of cessation after performing its function; “uditaḥ” = the present is that which has activity (now); “avyapadeśyaḥ” = that which is neither past nor present nor whose productive cause is visible (seen).Thus in the case of gold its powers to give rise to many shapes (forms) not heard or seen would be the undetermined (future) characteristics.

** **

The subtle elements are not conditioned by those. “sarvadharmānupātiṣu"=they correspond to all attributes, as the subtle elements are the source of all qualities. But both are basically wrong notions of the object.



“[sarvātmakeṣu](http://# "VBh. has 'sarvadharmātmakeṣu' whereas Vivaraṇa has sarvātmakeṣu'. ")"= as the subtle elements are not different from all [objects](http://# "The basis of all objects.").The ‘samāpatti’ in such an object is nirvicārā. Whatever is the characteristic of 'nirvitarkā' all that is seen here in '[nirvicārā](http://# "The comparison is based on being unconditioned by any properties even though the object of samāpatti is different in nirvitarkā and nirvicārā. ")'.

He indicates that (through the words) "evamsvarūpam...[muparañjayati](http://# "Instead of 'etenaiva' in the bhāṣya the Vivaraṇa has 'anenaiva'.")" = the subtle object devoid of the attributes of place, time, cause,experience, etc.,of the essence of all objects and corresponding to all properties (is the support and colours the samādhi-insight).

** **

"prajñā ca...nirvicārā” = in that state ‘nirvicārā' is distinguished from 'nirvitarkā'. He indicates that himself (through the words) “mahadvastuviṣayā” and so on. The compound “mahadvastu" is dissolved as 'that object of magnitude is the object having magnitude' similar to the 'the head of Rāhu'. That which has that as an object is "mahadvastuviṣayā savitarkā....[nirvicārā ceti](http://# "VBh. ends with 'ca' whereas Vivaraṇa has 'ceti'. Nirvitarkā has an object with magnitude as support while 'nirvicārā has a subtle element as support.")".

By these two samāpattis called 'savitarkā' and 'nirvitarkā' the two samāpattis, ‘savicārā' and 'nirvicārā' have been explained. “ubhayoḥ” = of the two ‘savitarkā' and 'nirvitarkā' “nirvitarkāyā”vyākhyātā = nirvicārā' has been explained (through nirvitarkā) i.e., 'savicārā' has been explained through 'savitarkā' as in both places there are common qualities. The distinction (between the two) has also been mentioned.

The subtle object extends upto the 'aliṅga' (prakṛti).

Of the atom of earth the subtle object (of the reflective and super-reflective states) is the subtle element of odour (as being the cause of the earth atom). Of (the atom of) water (it is) the subtle element of taste. Of (the atom of fire) it is the subtle element of colour. Of (the atom of) air (it is) the subtle element of touch. Of (the atom of) ether it is the subtle element of sound. Of these (subtle elements) it is the 'sense of I'. Of this also, the 'liṅga' (mahat) alone is the subtle object (of the reflective and super-reflective states). Of the mere 'liṅga' also the 'aliṅga'(prakṛti) is the subtle object. There is no (other) subtle object beyond 'prakṛti'.

 

It may be said that there is the subtle 'puruṣa'; the reply is that this is true. (But) the subtlety of ‘alinga' (which is) beyond the 'linga' does not similarly belong to 'puruṣa'. However, ‘puruṣa' is not the material cause (anvayīkāraṇam) of the 'liṅga' but is the instrumental cause (hetu). Therefore the subtlety in ‘prakṛti' has been explained as being unexcelled.

It is mentioned that 'savicārā' and 'nirvicārā' samāpattis are concerned with subtle-objects. In that context, the limit of subtlety is considered (through the sūtra) *sūkṣmaviṣayatvañcālingaparyavasānam.* In connection with earth the subtle object is only of the nature of the essence of smell of the atom of [earth](http://# "VBh. has 'pārthivasyāṇorgandhatanmātram' whereas Vivaraṇa has 'gandhamātra' which is not correct as it is referring to the subtle element of smell."). Even its nature as essence of smell has only the [liṅga](http://# "Liṅgamātram is not found in VBh. at all."),the essence of mahat as the subtle object.

 

It is called liṅga because (1) the subtle elements which come out of mahat which is liṅga alone, get absorbed in it along with ahaṁkāra (ego) or (2) after absorption they come out of the liṅga from [pradhāna](http://# "Pradhāna is aliṅga but liṅga comes out of pradhāna therefore it is mentioned here along with liṅga.").The opposite of that is aliṅga, pradhāna, which does not get absorbed nor does it come out of something else after absorption. "lingamātrasya...viṣayaḥ" = (of the mere liṅga also aliṅga is the subtle object).

 

There is no other subtle object beyond prakṛti.Subtlety is that which is the cause with reference to a gross object and that reaches its limit in aliṅga. There is no other subtle cause beyond pradhāna, the aliṅga "[nanu puruṣa iti](http://# "VBh. has ‘nanvasti' whereas Vivaraṇa has 'nanu puruṣa'.")".

** **

Objection—But then, surely purusa comes at the limit in the order of subtle causes?

 

Answer—There is no defect here. Some people accept puruṣa also as a cause; it is with such a doubt that it is mentioned "nanu puruṣa” and so on.The subtlety of aliṅga is due to its being of the nature of [aliṅga](http://# "It does not come into existence and so is not an effect, whereas all the others come into being and are thus effects.").How is this [so](http://# "Puruṣa does not give rise to mahat but prakṛti does.")?Because the cause of liṅga is aliṅga. The rule is that whatever is the natural (material) cause of something else is subtle with reference to the latter.

** **

Objection—But then, puruṣa is also of the nature of aliṅga.

 

Answer–Quite right, but purṣua is not subtle with reference to [liṅga](http://# "If objects have consciousness or if puruṣa is an effect, puruṣa can be an object of experience.").How is that? Because puruṣa is not the natural (material) cause of linga though he is of the nature of aliṅga. This is because an effect has no correlation with consciousness.

** **

किञ्च–पुरुषस्यापि भोग्यत्वप्रसङ्गः।तथा च पारार्थ्यं सुखदुःखमोहात्मकत्वं च,निर्हेतुकत्वं च प्रधानस्य च (पुरुषस्य)।तच्च सर्वप्रमाण (प्राण) विप्रकुपितमित्यत आह—हेतुस्तु भवतीति।प्रधानप्रवृत्तौ भोक्तृत्वेन निमित्तं भवतीत्यर्थः।अतः प्रधानस्य सौक्ष्म्यं निरतिशयं व्याख्यातम्॥४५॥

** **

Moreover, there will be the danger of puruṣa being experienced (in such a situation). Then it will be for the sake of another being of the nature of pleasure, pain and delusion and pradhāna will not be the cause (as understood in the system). And that will upset all the known proofs. Thus it is said "hetustu bhavatīti" i.e., in the activity of pradhāna,purusa is the (efficient) cause by being the experiencer."ataḥ [pradhānasya](http://# "VBh. has pradhāna whereas Vivaraṇa has pradhānasya.")...." (Therefore the subtlety in pradhāna has been explained as unexcelled).

**ता एव सबीजः समाधिः॥४६॥**

**  **

All these (are) concentration (s) having seed(s).

**** 

ताश्चतस्त्रः समापत्तयः बहिर्वस्तुबीजा इति समाधिरपि सबीजः।तत्र स्थूलेऽर्थॆसवितर्कोनिर्वितर्कः,सूक्ष्मेऽर्थॆसविचारो निर्विचारः, इति चतुर्धापसंख्यातः समाधिरिति॥४६॥

** **

These four balanced-states have outside objects as their seeds, so the concentration also is (said to be) with seed. Amongst these that (balanced-state directed) towards a gross object is deliberative (and) super-deliberative; that balanced-state directed towards a subtle object is reflective and super-reflective. (In this way) that concentration has been explained as of four kinds.



** **

ता एव सबीजः समाधिः। चतस्रः समापत्तयो बहिर्वस्तुविषया इति बहिर्वस्तुविषयत्वं हेतुः सबीजत्वे। समाधिरपि सबीजः सम्प्रज्ञातो 'वितर्कविचारानन्दास्मितारूपानुगमात्सम्प्रज्ञातः' इत्युपव्याख्यातः। स्थूलेऽर्थे सवितर्को निर्वितर्कः, सूक्ष्मेऽर्थे सविचारो निर्विचार इति चोपव्याख्यातः वितर्कादिलक्षणसूत्रेण॥४६॥

** **

*tāeva sabījaḥsamādhiḥ.* Four [samāpattis](http://# "savitarka, nirvitarka, savicāra, and nirvicāra.") have external objects (as supports); thus the reason for calling them with seed' is because their objects are external (things). "samādhirapi sabījaḥ” = samprajñāta is also with seed which has been explained in the sūtra *[vitarkavicārānandāsmitārūpānugamātsaṃprajñātaḥ](http://# "YS, I.17.").*When the object is gross it is savitarka and nirvitarka, when the object is subtle it is savicāra and nirvicāra—thus it has been explained by the sūtra describing vitarka, etc.

**निर्विचारवैशारद्येऽध्यात्मप्रसादः॥४७॥**

** **

On attaining clarity (vaiśāradya) of the super-reflective state there is purity proceeding from the self (adhyātmaprasādaḥ).

** **

अशुद्ध्यावरणमलापेतस्य प्रकाशात्मनो बुद्धिसत्वस्य रजस्तमोभ्यामनभिभूतः स्वच्छः स्थितिप्रवाहो वैशारद्यम्। यदा निर्विचारस्य समाधेः वैशारद्यमिदं जायते, तदा योगिनो भवत्यध्यात्मप्रसादो भूतार्थविषयः क्रमानुरोधी स्फुटः प्रज्ञाऽऽलोकः।  
 

तथा चोक्तम्—

प्रज्ञाप्रासादमारुह्य अशोच्यः शोचतो जनान्।  
भूमिष्ठानिव शैलस्थः सर्वान्प्राज्ञोऽनुपश्यति॥ ॥४७॥

** **

The pure steady flow of the 'sattva-intelligence', which is not overpowered by 'rajas' and 'tamas', which is of the nature of brightness (and) from which the dirt of the impure covering has been removed is (called) clarity. When this clarity of the super-reflective concentration comes into being, then the yogīis possessed of purity proceeding from the self. (This purity) has as its object the thing as it is; (it is) a clear flash of insight which does not follow (the usual) process (of experience).

** **

Thus it is said :—Just as a person on top of a mountain looks at those on the surface of the earth, the discerning (yogī) who is free from pain,having climbed (the mountain in the form of) the purity of 'samādhi-intelligence', sees all others as suffering.

** **

तथा चोक्तम्—

 *nirvicāravaiśāradye'dhyātmaprasādaḥ.* "aśuddhyāvaraṇamalāpetasya" = impurity itself is the covering, it is the dirt consisting of afflictions,etc., free from that."prakāśātmanaḥ...[tmaprasādaḥ](http://# "Nothing new is added in the Vivaraṇa and the bhāṣya is repeated.")" (adhyātmaprasādaḥ) i.e., discriminate knowledge regarding the self, [etc](http://# "Knowledge of the distinction between the self and sattva-intellect.").The explanation of this is (through the words) "bhūtārthaviṣayaḥ [kramānurodhī sphuṭaḥ prajñālokaḥ](http://# "Both Vācaspati Miśra and Vijñānabhikṣu have ‘kramānanurodhī' instead of 'kramānurodhi'.The bhāṣya has 'sphuṭaḥ' while the Vivaraṇa uses sphuṭam. If it qualifies 'prajñālokaḥ' it is grammatically incorrect.")"i.e., gradually, till such time as the afflictions are totally obstructed the flash that is insight follows a course of getting clearer (and clearer); and by that, one knows the object as it truly is.

 Thus it is said—Just as a person on top of a mountain looks at those on the surface of the earth, the discerning (yogī) free from pain... sees all others as [suffering](http://# "The bhāṣya has 'aśocyaḥ' whereas the Vivaraṇa has 'na śocyaḥ'. No further explanation is also added by the Vivaraṇakāra.").

ऋतम्भरा तत्र प्रज्ञा॥४८॥

 In that (super-reflective balanced-state) there is discernment known as 'ṛtaṃbharā'.

 तस्मिन् समाहितचित्तस्य या प्रज्ञा जायते, तस्या ऋतंभरा इति संज्ञा भवति। अन्वर्था च सा, सत्यमेव बिभर्ति, न च तत्र विपर्यासज्ञानगन्धोऽप्यस्तीति।  
तथा चोक्तम्—

“आगमेनानुमानेन ध्यानाभ्यासरसेन च।  
त्रिधा प्रकल्पयन् प्रज्ञां लभते योगमुत्तमम्॥” इति॥४८॥

 The discernment which arises in one who has attained stability in that state (super-reflective state) has the name 'ṛtaṃbharā'.This name follows its meaning—(for) it only bears truth and nothing else;in that, there is not even a trace of error. Thus it has been said 'Training the discernment in three ways through the scriptures (āgama), through inference and through the practice of meditation,the yogī attains the highest yoga.'

 ऋतंभरा तत्र प्रज्ञा। तस्मिन् प्रज्ञालोकेऽध्यात्मप्रसादे समाहितस्य या प्रज्ञा जायते विवेकजन्मा, तस्या विवेकजन्मनः ऋतम्भरेति संज्ञा भवति। अन्वर्थैव सा सत्यमेव बिभर्ति न तत्र विपर्यासज्ञानगन्धोऽप्यस्ति। प्रक्षीणसकलविपर्यासकल्मषस्य हि जायते। जायमाना च विषयकलङ्कमपनुदति॥

 *ṛtaṃbharātatra prajñā.* "tasmin" = in the light of insight, in the discriminate knowledge regarding the self, "samāhitasya yā prajñā jāyate"= the discernment (in one who has attained stability in that nirvicāra state) "tasya" = that discernment (is called ṛta*ṃ*bharā). "anvarthaiva... [pyasti](http://# "VBh. has 'anvarthā ca sā' whereas Vivaraṇa has 'anvarthaiva sā'. Instead of 'na ca tatra' in the bhāṣya the Vivaraṇa has 'na tatra'. There is an additional 'iti' in the bhāṣya, which is missing in the Vivaraṇa.")".It appears in one in whom the taint of error is completely removed; and having appeared it destroys the impurities



** **

associated with the object of [knowledge](http://# "There is no scope for any error in this knowledge and the object is known as it truly is.").

**  **

तथा चोक्तम्—

आगमेनानुमानेन ध्यानाभ्यासरसेन च।

** **

Thus it is said—"agamenānumānena... yogamuttamam". Discernment (insight) due to the practice of yogic means are threefold. The first is that which follows the instructions in the śāstra and taught by the preceptors. The second deals with the same subject with the object of establishing it firmly by rejecting, through proper reasoning, whatever is in contradiction to scriptural teaching. Whereas the third is constant pursuit of the same idea (knowledge), the object of support (in meditation), which has been understood from the scriptures, and by [reasoning](http://# "The meaning of the compound word 'rasopayogī' in this context is difficult to follow."). In this manner, the yogī, training in the three ways, attains yoga.

Has a different object from that of the intelligence arising from the scriptures and inference; because it has a particular as its object.

** **

तस्मात् श्रुतानुमानप्रज्ञाभ्यामन्यविषया सा प्रज्ञा विशेषार्थत्वात् इति॥४९॥

** **

The knowledge which arises from the scriptures, which is heard, deals with generic objects. It is not possible to indicate a particular through the testimony of the scriptures.Why is it so? (Because) the scriptures (śabda) do not have the convention (of the relationship between a word and its meaning) established, keeping the particular (in mind). Similarly, (knowledge based on) inference, also deals with only generic objects. As, for instance, where there is reaching some place there is motion' and 'where



there is no reaching some place there is no motion'. And through inference there is conclusion in general terms (only).Therefore the object of (the knowledge of) the scriptural word and inference is not any particular.

 And there is no grasping of this subtle, hidden, far-away object through ordinary perception. (It should not be argued) that this particular, which is not the object of any source of valid knowledge, does not exist. That particular, whether it refers to a subtle element or to the puruṣa, is to be grasped by the discernment of 'samādhi' only. Therefore, that discernment (ṛtaṃbharā) has a different object from that of the intelligence arising from the scriptures and from inference, because it has a particular as its object.

 “[sā puna](http://# "The introduction in the bhāṣya to sūtra I.49.")[ḥ](http://# "The Vivaraṇa and the bhāṣya therein has the reading ")['](http://# "The introduction in the bhāṣya to sūtra I.49.")'' = ṛtaṃbharā prajñā has a different object from the object of knowledge of ordinary people. Thus he says—śrutānumānaprajñābhyāmanyaviṣayā. *viśeṣaḥ*; there is an endless number of particularities (particular objects); thus it is not possible to have convention dealing with them. A word has conventional connection only with the universal. And with that word it is not possible to make known or denote a particular if the convention with that particular is not already known.

 "tathānumānam..." (knowledge based on inference deals with universals) and that has already been mentioned as "[sāmānyāvadhāraṇapradhānā vṛttiḥ](http://# "VBh. under YS, I.7.")". It has been indicated by the example "[yatra prāptiḥ…gatiḥ](http://# "The Vivaraṇa and the bhāṣya therein has the reading ")”“anumānena...hāraḥ” = it is only the universals that inference can lead to. "tasmā ...[kaścidasti](http://# "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add much to what Vyāsa says in the bhāṣya. ")".

 यद्येवं न लोकप्रत्यक्षेणापरेण भूतसूक्ष्मगतः पुरुषगतो वा विशेषः प्रज्ञायेत। नान्यच्च प्रमाणत्रयव्यतिरिक्तं प्रमाणमस्ति, येन तद्विशेषं सञ्जानीमहे इति चेदाह—न चास्य सूक्ष्मव्यवहितविप्रकृष्टस्य वस्तुनो लोकप्रत्यक्षेण ग्रहणम्।न चास्य विशेषस्याप्रमाणकस्याभावोऽस्तीति। प्रमाणावगम्यमानरूपो हि भावोऽस्ति राजवीथीमधिरोहति। तस्मात् समाधिप्रज्ञानिर्ग्राह्य एव विशेषो भवति भूतसूक्ष्मगतः पुरुषगतो वा॥

 Objection—If that is so then the particular pertaining to the subtle elements or to puruṣa cannot be perceived by any ordinary perception. Nor is there another valid proof other than the three[proofs](http://# "Perception, inference and scriptural authority in the Sāṅkhya-Yoga system.")by which we could know that particular.

 Answer—He then says (in reply) “na cāsya" and so on. Anything that exists has a form that can be known through proofs; it ascends on the king's [path](http://# "A way of saying that it surely exists without any doubt.").
Therefore



"samādhi....[vā](http://# "The attention to detail in following the text as it is, is missing in the Vivaraṇa as pointed out on many occasions. Here also the “sa” before ")”(that particular, whether it refers to a subtle element or to the puruṣa, is to be grasped by the discernment of samādhi only).

 ननु च ते सूक्ष्मगता विशेषाः प्रत्यक्षेणावगम्यन्ते इति किमीश्वराज्ञापितम्? वस्तुत्वादवगम्यन्त इति चेत्—अगमानुमानाभ्यां सन्तीत्यवगम्यन्त एव। न च नियामकं किंचिदस्ति प्रत्यक्षेणैव निर्ग्राह्या इति। न हि विशेषा हस्ततलगता अपि सर्वे गृह्यन्ते—न— अन्यवस्तुगतविशेषाणां प्रत्यक्षग्राह्यत्वस्यानुमेयत्वात्॥

कथम्? एवं मन्यते—भूतसूक्ष्मादिगता विशेषाः प्रत्यक्षग्राह्याः कस्यचित् कार्यवस्तुविशेषत्वात्,गृह्यमाणस्वपाणिगतविशेषवदिति। तस्माच्छ्रुतानुमानप्रज्ञाभ्यामन्यविषया सा प्रज्ञा, विशेषार्थत्वादिति। विशेषार्था हि सा॥ ४९॥

 Objection— But then, you say that those particulars pertaining to the subtle elements are known through direct perception; so does it mean that they are not made known by [Īśvara](http://# "If direct perception in samadhi is the only means then what about the belief in Īśvara making known the objects.").

 Answer — They are known as substances that exist. Objection They are known as existing from the scriptures and through inference; and there is no rule that one should know them only through direct perception. And not everyone grasps particulars even when placed on one's palm.

 Answer—That is not so; it is inferred that particulars pertaining to any object can be perceived directly. How is that possible? It is thought thus-particulars pertaining to subtle elements, etc., can be directly perceived by anyone as they are special effects, just like the particular (object) placed on one's hand can be grasped. “tasmācchrutā ...[viśesārthatvāditi](http://# "Nothing new is added to the bhāṣya.")"= ( thus ) it has a particular as its object; it is indeed a particular (special) object.

  समाधिप्रज्ञाप्रतिलम्भे योगिनः प्रज्ञाकृतः संस्कारो नवो नवो जायते।

 When a yogīattains the discernment of samādhi there arise ever new subliminal-impressions created by (that) discernment.

तज्जः संस्कारोऽन्यसंस्कारप्रतिबन्धी॥५०॥

 The subliminal-impression arising from that (r̥tambharā) is opposed to other sub-liminal-impressions.

**** समाधिप्रज्ञाप्रभवः संस्कारो व्युत्थानसंस्काराशयं बाधते।व्युत्थानसंस्काराभिभवात् तत्प्रभवाः प्रत्यया न भवन्ति।प्रत्ययनिरोधे समाधिरुपतिष्ठते। ततः समाधिजा प्रज्ञा,ततः प्रज्ञाकृताः संस्काराः इति,नवो नवः संस्काराशयो जायते। ततश्च प्रज्ञा,ततश्च संस्कारा इति। कथमसौ संस्काराशयश्चित्तं साधिकारं न करिष्यतीति?न ते प्रज्ञाकृताः संस्काराः क्लेशक्षयहेतुत्वात् चित्तमधिकारविशिष्टं कुर्वन्ति। चित्तं हि ते स्वकार्यादवसादयन्ति। ख्यातिपर्यवसानं हि चित्तचेष्टितमिति॥५०॥



 The subliminal-impression arising from the discernment of 'samādhi' obstructs the (unwakened) deposit of the subliminal-impressions of activity. When the sub-liminal-impressions of activity are overcome there are no ideas (modifications) which arise from them. When the ideas are restricted 'samādhi' follows. Then (comes) discernment born of 'samādhi', then the subliminal-impressions created by discernment; thus are born again and again deposits of subliminal-impressions. Thus from (samādhi) discernment (comes into being) and from that the subliminal-impressions (of samādhi).

 Question—How is that this deposit of subliminal-impressions do not make the mind equipped with power (to come back to activity)?

 Answer—Because they cause the destruction of the afflictions, those subliminal-impressions created by discernment do not make the mind qualified by power. They make the mind lose the capacity to produce its effects. The activity of the mind ends with (the rising of) discriminate-discernment.

 समाधिप्रज्ञाप्रतिलम्भे योगिनः प्रज्ञाकृतः संस्कारो नवो जायते। प्रज्ञा हि संस्कारारम्भिणीति सिद्धम्।प्रज्ञाभिनवत्वात्तत्संस्कारः प्रत्यग्रतरो जायते इति विशेषः।प्रज्ञानवत्वं तु तस्या (सामान्य) अन्यविषयत्वात्।तज्जस्संस्कारोऽन्यसंस्कारप्रतिबन्धी ऋतम्भरप्रज्ञाप्रभवसंस्कारो व्युत्थानसंस्काराशयं अन्यं बाधते विशिष्ट्यथार्थविषयप्रभवत्वात्प्रतिबध्नाति। आमोक्षाच्छेत इति संस्काराशयः।

 "samādhi...[jāyate](http://# "Bhāṣya introduction to YS, I.50.")"it is established that insight (knowledge) gives rise to subliminal-impressions. Insight being new gives rise to strong subliminal-impressions—this is its special [characteristic](http://# "Ordinarily a new event creates a strong impression; the same principle is mentioned here."). The novelty of (this) knowledge (insight) is because its object is [different](http://# "Different from ordinary objects.").


[*tajjassaṃskāro'nyasaṃskārapratibandhī*](http://# "The sūtra has 'tajja' whereas the Vivaraṇa makes the sandhi and has 'tajjas . . .'. "); the subliminal-impression arising from ṛtaṃbharā obstructs the other (unawakened deposit of the subliminal-impressions of activity)-it obstructs because it arises from a special true object. “saṃskārāśayaḥ" is so-called as it lies there upto the time it is liberated.

 व्युत्थानसंस्काराभिभवात् व्युत्थानसंस्काराशयस्य समाधिप्रज्ञासंस्कारेणाभिभवात् तत्प्रभवाः व्युत्थानसंस्कारप्रभवाः प्रत्यया न भवन्ति। प्रत्ययनिरोधे व्युत्थानप्रत्ययनिरोधे समाधिः सम्प्रज्ञात इव उपतिष्ठते। ततः समाधिजा प्रज्ञा, ततः प्रज्ञाकृताः संस्कारा इति, एवं नवः संस्काराशयो वर्धते। ततश्च प्रज्ञा ततश्च संस्कारा इति॥

 "vyutthānasaṃskārābhibhavāt"= because the deposit of the subliminal-impressions of activity are overcome by the subliminal-impressions of the samadhi-insight; "tatprabhavāḥ" = those (the ideas) arising from the subliminal-impressions of activity (are not there). And "pratyayanirodhe" = when the ideas of activity are restricted, "samādhiḥ upatiṣṭhate" = what follows is samprajñāta, as it [were](http://# "The use of 'iva' is not clear. Perhaps he means that in fact it is something more, as it is prajñā alone or a state of deep insight. In samprajñāta there is still knowledge of an object but here the emphasis is on the state of prajñā and not on the object of knowledge.").Then (comes prajñā born of samādhi and then subliminal-impressions created by prajñā). In this manner,



the newer and newer (deposit of saṃskāra) grows. From that there is again prajñā and again from it (prajñā) saṃskāras.

 Objection—

It is said that the deposit of saṃskāras which arise due to samādhiprajñā is the cause of activity of the [mind](http://# "All impressions give rise to activity; therefore the opponent says that this prajñā-saṃskāra must give rise to activity.")as it gives rise to ideas, similar to the deposit of saṃskāra that arises from activity and like that it is the subliminal-impression of the mind. He indicates this (objection through the words) "kathamasau saṃskārāśayaḥ...." and so on. (How is the mind not connected with subliminal- impressions of activity?).  
 Answer—

There is no defect here, as there is opposition to it (activity).

 Objection—

How is that?

 Answer—

"te saṃskārāḥ... kurvanti". The subliminal-impressions which arise due to thoughts of activity have the afflictions like 'avidyā', etc., as their cause and are responsible for the mind coming face-to-face with those subliminal-impressions. But arising from thoughts which are opposed to it (activity) the subliminal-impressions which arise from thoughts which give rise to samādhi are not the cause for making the mind inclined towards activity.

 किञ्च—

चित्तञ्च ते स्वकार्यात् संस्काराभिमुखवृत्तिभ्योऽवसादयन्ति विरमयन्ति। ख्यातिपर्यवसानं हि चित्तविचेष्टितम्। पुरुषख्यातिश्च जाता संस्कारश्च भवतीति विरुद्धम्॥

 यो हि विगततृष्णासमुदायो,नासौ पानीयं पिपासति। एतावदेव चित्तेन पुरुषस्य करणीयम्। न हि कश्चित् कृतं करणीयं चिकीर्षति॥५०॥

 Moreover—"cittañca te ....[vasādayanti](http://# "Instead of 'cittam hi' in the bhāṣyas we have cittañca' in the Vivaraṇa.")"= they make the mind turn back from activities that are inclined towards (in keeping with) the subliminal-impressions. “khyāti... [ceṣṭitam](http://# "In the bhāṣya we have cittaceṣṭitam' whereas in the Vivaraṇa we get 'cittaviceṣṭitam'.")". It is a contradiction to say that there is knowledge (insight) regarding puruṣa and there is subliminal-impression (of activity).

 One in whom thirst has disappeared has no desire to drink anything. Similarly it is only up to achieving this (knowledge of puruṣa) that puruṣa has work to be done by the mind. No one desires that which is done as something to be [done](http://# "The idea seems to be that once the task is done no one considers it as something to be done again. Thus 'puruṣa-knowledge' having dawned it is not something which will have to occur again. And so the mind has accomplished its task and has nothing further to do.").



 किं चास्य भवति—

 Moreover what else does he gain?

तस्यापि निरोधे सर्वनिरोधान्निर्बीजः समाधिः॥५१॥

 On restricting even that (prajñā-samskāra) since all is restricted, (there arises) the ‘samādhi' without seed; or on restricting that (prajñā-saṃskāra) and the (discernment) also, since everything is restricted (there arises) the 'samādhi' without seed.

 स न केवलं समाधिप्रज्ञाविरोधी,प्रज्ञाकृतानामपि संस्काराणां प्रतिबन्धी भवति। कस्मात्? निरोधजः संस्कारः समाधिजान् संस्कारान् बाधत इति।

 इति श्रीपातञ्जलयोगसूत्रभाष्ये श्रीमद्वेदव्यासकृते प्रथमः समाधिपादः॥

 That (seedless samādhi) is not only the enemy of the 'samādhi-discernment', but also the opposer of the subliminal-impressions created by discernment. How is that? The subliminal-impression,born of restriction, obstructs the subliminal-impressions born of ‘samādhi'.

 By the experience of the lapse of time in the restricted state, one can infer the existence of the subliminal-impressions created by the restricted mind. The mind, together with the subliminal-impressions born of the 'samādhi' which restricts activity, (and together with the subliminal-impressions) which lead one to liberation (kaivalyabhāgīyaiḥ), is absorbed into its (cause) the permanent 'prakṛti'.Therefore, those subliminal-impressions (of the restricted state) of the mind, being the opposers of (the mind’s) power, are not the cause of its (restricted) 'samādhi' state. Because of this, the mind with its power exhausted, turns away (from its activity) together with the subliminal-impressions which lead to liberation.

 When the mind turns away (from activity) the 'puruṣa' stays in its own essence and is therefore called the pure, the isolated,the free. Thus in the commentary of Vyāsa on the Yoga-śāstra of Patañjali (this is) the first quarter on 'samādhi'.

 "[kiñca...](http://॑# "The introduction to sūtra I.51.")" *tasyāpi nirodhe [sarvanirodhānnirbījasamādhiriti](http://# "There is no 'iti' in the sutra in the available readings. But the Vivaraṇa has an 'iti' at the end of the sūtra.")*.The word iti indicates the [end](http://# "Does it indicate the end of the pāda or the end of the practice? It probably indicates the end of the practice according to the Vivaraṇakāra.").

* tasyāpi nirodhe* = when the newer and newer subliminal-impressions which arise from samādhi-prajñā (are restricted); the word *api* means when even that samadhi-prajñā which is the cause of the subliminal-impressions is restricted then there is sarvanirodhaḥ = (restriction of all). The twofold means of restriction called superior-detachment and 'practice of cessation of modifications' has already been [mentioned](http://# "YS, 1.18.").

 Now what is that *sarvam* (all) which will be restricted? They are the state of activity, samādhi-prajñā, and their subliminal-impressions. Then since all is restricted, there is seedless-samadhi.

 "sa na kevalam... pratibandhī"= the subliminal-impression created by ṛtambharā prajñā restricts that ṛtambharā prajñā of [samādhi](http://# "While Miśra and Bhikṣu interpret sa as asaṃprajñāta (seedless-samādhi) the Vivaraṇakāra takes it to mean ṛtambharā-prajñā or the highest point of saṃprajñāta.").Similarly, through restraint (restriction) there is opposition to itself (prajña) and even to the subliminal-impressions created by its own causal prajñā along with similar prajñās.

 कस्मात्? निरोधजः संस्कारः यस्मात्समाधिप्रज्ञायास्तज्जन्मनश्च संस्कारस्य निरोधे निरोधकः समाधिप्रज्ञाजनितसंस्कारादन्यो जायते,स चापि यतः समाधिप्रज्ञां तज्जनितसंस्कारांश्चातिरस्कृत्य न जन्म प्रतिपद्यते,तस्मात्स निरोधजः संस्कारः समाधिजान्संस्कारान्बाधत इति॥

 कथं पुनरसौ निरोधजः संस्कारोऽस्तीति गम्यते? विद्यमानेऽपि स बाधको भवतीति? आह—

निरोधस्थितिकालक्रमानुभवेनेति। निरोधस्य स्थितिस्तस्याः कालः स च कालः क्रमेणानुभूयते,यतः प्रत्यभ्यासमभि वर्धते,तस्मात्तेन निरोधस्थितिकालक्रमानुभवेन निरोधचित्तकृतं निरोधावस्थचित्तकृतं संस्कारास्तित्वमनुमेयम्॥

 How is this possible? “nirodhajaḥ...bādhate” i.e., when samādhi-prajñā and the subliminal-impressions arising from it are restrained then there arises a (subliminal-impression) belonging to restraint which is different from the subliminal-impression created by samadhi-prajñā.And since that does not appear without removing samādhi-prajñā and the subliminal-impressions created by it, it "nirodhajaḥ saṃskāraḥ samādhijānsaṃskārānbādhata iti". (obstructs the subliminal-impressions born of samādhi).

 How does one know that there is subliminal-impression born of total restraint? Also even if it exists how does it oppose? He says "“nirodhasthitikālakramānubhavena". The analysis of the compound is as follows—

the existence of nirodha, its time, and the experience of that time by successive longer periods; thus when there are longer periods of practice then "nirodhasthiti....anumeyam" = (by experience of the lapse of time in the restricted state one can infer the existence of the subliminal-impressions created by the mind in a restricted state).

 "vyutthānanirodha... [bhavantīti](http://# "There is no 'bhavanti' in the bhāṣya but it is there in the Vivaraṇa.")". As the mind, along with the subliminal-impressions born of samādhi which restricts activity and the subliminal-impressions born of restraint along with the subliminal-impressions which lead one to liberation, has lost its power (for bondage) it is dissolved in its cause ahamkāra i.e., [asmitā](http://# "Asmitā is what is meant here and not the sense-of-ego denoted by ahaṃkāra.").Hence those subliminal-impressions brought about by restriction of knowledge (prajñā) being the opposers of the power of the mind (for bondage) are not the causes for existence.


"yasmādavasitādhikāram...[ityucyate](http://# "All available readings have 'vinivartate' whereas the Vivaraṇa has 'vivartate'. The Vivaraṇakāra omits the words atah śuddhaḥ' while quoting the bhāṣya.")". The mind then turns away from that purusa whose purpose (of release) has been achieved. And release (liberation) is only the cessation of modifications of the mind.

 Thus this is the first chapter, the Samādhipāda,in the Vivaraṇa of the *Pātañjalayogasūtrabhāṣya* written by Śrī Śaṅkarabhagav*ā*n the Paramahaṃsasannyāsin,who is the disciple of Śrī Govindabhagavatpūjyapāda.



**साधनपादः**

**Sādhanapadaḥ**

 उद्दिष्टः समाहितचित्तस्य योगः। कथं व्युत्थितचित्तोऽपि योगयुक्तः स्यादित्येतदारभ्यते—

 Yoga achieved by one who has a steadied mind has been mentioned. This (chapter) is begun (in order) to indicate how even one with an active (restless) mind can attain yoga.

तपःस्वाध्यायेश्वरप्रणिधानानि क्रियायोगः॥१॥

 Self-discipline, study (of the scriptures) (and) devotion to Īśvara are yoga in the form of action.

 नातपस्विनो योगः सिध्यति। अनादिकर्मक्लेशवासनाचित्रा प्रत्युपस्थितविषयजाला चाशुद्धिर्नान्तरेण तपः संभेदमापद्यत इति तपस उपादानम्। तच्च चित्तप्रसादनमबाधमानमनेनासेव्यमिति मन्यते।

स्वाध्यायः प्रणवादिपवित्राणां जपो मोक्षशास्त्राध्ययनं वा।  
ईश्वरप्रणिधानं सर्वक्रियाणां परमगुरावर्पणं तत्फलसंन्यासो वा॥

 A man without self-discipline cannot achieve yoga; the impurity (in the form of tamas and rajas in the mind) which is variegated due to the beginningless karma (deeds), kleśa (afflictions) and vāsanā (subliminal-impressions) and which (make the mind) face the snares of sense objects, cannot be weakened without austerity; therefore, austerity is included in the sūtra. And that austerity, which does not adversely affect the clarity of the mind, is to be practised by a yogī.

 Svādhyāya is the repetition of purifying mantras such as Om or study of scriptures pertaining to liberation.

 Īśvarapraṇidhāna is the dedication of all action to the Supreme God (guru) or renouncing the (desire for) the fruit of all actions.

 अथेदानीं द्वितीयः साधनपाद आरभ्यते। कैवल्यस्य साधनं सम्यग्दर्शनम्। योगसाधनानि च योगद्वारेण सम्यग्दर्शनसाधनान्येव। तानि च प्राधान्येनास्मिन्पादे प्रतिपाद्यन्त इति साधनपाद इत्युच्यते॥

 तथा, योगसाधनानुष्ठानप्रवृत्तस्यानुषङ्गिकविभूतेः प्राधान्येन प्रतिपादनाद्विभूतिपाद इत्युच्यते तृतीयः॥

 तथा, सकलयोगैश्वर्यविभूतिभ्यो विरक्तस्य सर्वोपसंहारद्वारेण कैवल्यस्य प्राधान्येन प्रदर्शनात् कैवल्यपाद इत्युच्यते चतुर्थः॥

 तथा, समाधिः प्राधान्येनादावुपाख्यात इति प्रथमः समाधिपाद इत्युच्यते॥

 Now then is begun the second chapter (called the) Sādhanapādaḥ.The means to kaivalya is correct knowledge. The aids (means) to yoga are only the means to correct (right) knowledge through yoga. And they are importantly dealt with (explained) in



this chapter; therefore this chapter is known as Sādhanapādaḥ.

 Thus because of indicating importantly the powers that invariably come to one engaged in the practice of the means to yoga the third chapter is called Vibhūtipādaḥ.

 Similarly because of indicating importantly kaivalya as a final conclusion (end) which comes to one who is detached from all the attainments of yogic powers the fourth chapter is called the Kaivalyapādaḥ.

 Similarly since samādhi has been explained prominently at the beginning (in the first chapter) the first chapter is called the Samādhipādaḥ.

 तपआदिसाधनमनुक्रम्यते-तपस्स्वाध्यायेश्वरप्रणिधानानि क्रियायोगः।

 Thus he (Vyāsa) says (in the introduction to this pāda)..."uddhiṣṭaḥ...[iti](http://# "There is no “iti")",i.e., with regard to one not attached to karma (yoga has been explained). Regarding a yogīwho has attained steadiness through the practice of such meditative means as friendliness, compassion, etc.samādhi-without-seed (nirbīja) achieved by superior-detachment and practice of cessation of modifications has been mentioned (in the first pāda). "katham...ārabhyate" = how can even one who is of a distracted mind become fit for samādhi ? In order to answer that (question) this pāda is begun.

It describes in succession the means like tapas (austerity,self-discipline),etc.,as *tapassvādhyāyeśvarapraṇidhānāni kriyāyogaḥ.*

 Objection—

Since self-discipline, study of the scriptures and devotion to Īśvara are going to be described under [niyama](http://# "YS, II.32.")why are they mentioned here?

  Objection—But then,is it only for the purpose as already stated, that even an active mind can be steadied in yoga?

 Answer —

That is not so; where the niyamas are mentioned this result is also [mentioned](http://# "Under the bhāsya in II.32, the result of niyama is given as the attainment of the final end of yoga.").

 Question—

Then is it for the sake of weakening of the afflictions?



 Answer—

It is not so,as that is also mentioned there itself asyogāṅga.....*[kṣaye](http://# "YS, II.28.").aśuddhiḥ* are the afflictions,etc. The practice of devotion as samādhi also comes under the practice of the means to yoga.Thus the sūtra samādhi... nāt.

 Question—

Therefore the mention of austerity, etc., in this context is meaningless.

 Answer—

It is not so; it serves the purpose of indicating that the practice of the aids of yoga, which is a means to right vision, precedes true insight. All the means to yoga, being the means to true insight, precede true insight. Amongst them a part of niyama has been mentioned in this context indicating the priority of all means (to true insight). Even though the priority in time is established by the very meaning (of the word) because of its being the [means](http://# "The means will necessarily precede the end — so the word 'upāya' is itself self-explanatory."),
still, as it stands, there is (more) [clarity](http://# "This is a strange argument hardly serving any epistemic purpose.").

 ननु चैवमपि प्राक् सम्यग्दर्शनादनन्तरं पठितव्यम्—

उच्यते—

न —

किं अविद्यायास्तपआदिः साक्षात्प्रतिपक्षः? किं वा सम्यग्दर्शनमेवेति॥

 Objection —

But then; even though it is prior to true insight it is to be mentioned after [it](http://# "Not here but very much later, before discussing right vision.").

 Answer—

That is not so; true insight alone is directly opposed to afflictions and so on. Avidyā is the basis of all difficulties. And that (avidyā) is made to cease through true insight which directly opposes it. If austerity, etc., are mentioned (discussed) later than that (avidyā), there will be interruption between avidyā and right [vision](http://# "The idea being that avidyā as the basis of saṃsāra should directly precede discussion on saṁyakdarśana, without other subjects like niyama intruding. ").Then will arise the doubt whether austerity, [etc](http://# "tapaḥ, svādhyāya and Īśvarapraṇidhāna.").,directly oppose avidyā. Or does right vision alone oppose (avidyā).

 किञ्च—

विषयश्च प्रथमं दर्शनीयः सम्यग्दर्शनशास्त्रस्य। स च क्लेशकर्मविपाकाशयाभिभूतः पुरुषः। यथा रोगार्तः चिकित्साशास्त्रस्य विषयः। तपआदेस्तदनन्तरं समाम्नाने विषयविषयिणौ व्यवधीयेयातां, ततश्चायं विषयोऽयञ्च विषयीति न विविच्येत॥

 पादादौ च पाठे सम्यग्दर्शनोपायत्वं च प्रतिपादितं भवति, प्रथमपादसम्बन्धश्च व्याख्यातः स्यात्-समाहितचित्तस्य योग उद्दिष्टः, व्युत्थितचित्तोऽपि तपआदिसाधनः कथं योगयुक्तः स्यादिति॥

 किञ्च —

समाधिभावनक्लॆशतनूकरणार्थत्वञ्च तपआदीनां दर्शयितव्यम्॥

 Moreover, one has to first point out the subject-matter of the discipline of true insight. And that is puruṣa overpowered by afflictions, karma and the result of karma; just as one afflicted by disease (or a patient) is the subject-matter of the science of medicine. If austerity is brought in after that, there will be interruption between the subject and the subject-matter; hence it will be difficult to distinguish the two as 'this is the subject-matter and this is the subject'.

 When it (tapaḥ, etc.) is mentioned (discussed) at the beginning of the chapter its



being a means to right vision is indicated; its connection with the first chapter is also [explained](http://॑# "Explained by Vyāsa in the introduction to YS, 11.1.")as 'yoga achieved by one who has a steadied mind has been mentioned; and how can even one whose mind is restless, who is following the means (of yoga) like austerity, etc., achieve yoga.' Moreover, it will be shown how austerity, etc., have the purpose of bringing about samadhi and weakening the [afflictions](http://# "YS, II.2.").

 ननु परस्तादेवैतद्वक्ष्यति— “समाधिसिद्धिरीश्वरप्रणिधानात् कायेन्द्रियसिद्धिरशुद्धिक्षयात्तपसः” इत्येवम्। प्रत्येकसाधनानां सिद्धिं च वक्ष्यति॥

 नैतदस्ति—सिद्धानामिह तत्र साधनस्तुत्यर्थमनुवादात्। अत्र हि तादर्थ्यमुच्यते। तथा चाह “समाधिभावनार्थः क्लेशतनूकरणार्थश्च” इति। तत्र ह्यनूद्यन्ते साधनस्तुतये॥

 Objection—But then, he will mention this later as [*samādhi.....nāt*](http://# "YS, II.45.")(because of devotion to god there is attainment of samadhi) and also as [*kāyen....tapasaḥ*](http://# "YS, II.43.")(because of austerity, due to removal of impurities, there is perfection in the body and sense-organs). The end achieved by each one of the means will also be mentioned.

 Answer — This is not so;here the result to be achieved (is mentioned) whereas there it is supplementary praise for the means. It is here that its meaning is [mentioned](http://# "The difference between YS,II.43, 45, ff., where the perfections that come about by practice of these means and the present sūtra, where the meaning of the words tapaḥ, etc., are discussed."). Thus he sayssamādhi......[nārthaśca.](http://# "YS, II.2.") [Therein](http://# "YS, II.43, 45, ff."),there is repetition in order to praise the means.

 सम्प्रति सूत्राक्षराणि व्याख्यायन्ते—तपश्च स्वाध्यायश्चेश्वरप्रणिधानञ्च तपस्स्वाध्यायेश्वरप्रणिधानानि।तान्येव क्रियारूपो योगः क्रियायोगः। तपआदिक्रिया च योगार्थत्वाद्योग इत्युच्यते। चित्तधर्मो हि समाधिर्योगः। तदर्थश्चायं क्रियायोगः।तस्मादनेन क्रियायोगेन योगीति॥

 तप इति कृच्छ्रचान्द्रायणादि, शीतोष्णादिद्वन्द्वसहत्वम्। स्वाध्यायः—प्रणवस्य मोक्षशास्त्राणां चोपनिषत्प्रभृतीनां पवित्राणां जपः। ईश्वरप्रणिधानं—क्रियाणां परमगुरावीश्वरे समर्पणम्। तासां वा फलसंन्यासः परमेश्वरे संन्यसनम्॥

 Now there is explanation of the meaning of the words of the sūtra. The word *tapaḥ... nāni* means austerity, study of the scriptures and devotion to Iśvara. Kriyāyogah = they are yoga in the form of action. As action like austerity, etc., have the purpose of (achieving) yoga they are called [yoga](http://# "kriyāyoga."). Yoga is samādhi which is a quality of the mind. This kriyāyoga has that as its purpose. Therefore through this kriyāyoga (one who practises it is called) a yogi.

 Tapaḥ = fasts like kṛcchra and cāndrāyaṇa, and enduring the opposites like heat and [cold](http://# "These are very difficult austerities."). Svādhyāyaḥ = the constant recitation of the syllable Oṃand the sacred scriptural texts that deal with liberation beginning with the Upaniṣads, etc., Īśvarapraṇidhāna = the surrender of all deeds (action) to Īśvara the supreme teacher;



or the renunciation of their fruit (result), i.e., the reunciation with references to [Īśvara](http://# "The Gītāconcept of renunciation of the fruit of action, or the dedication of all one's actions to Īśvara. The former is karma-yoga while the latter is bhakti-yoga.").

 कथं पुनश्चित्तसमाधानं प्रति विप्रकृष्टस्य कायक्केशादिरूपस्य तपसो योगत्वम्? स्वाध्यायेश्वरप्रणिधानयोस्तु युक्तमन्तरङ्गत्वाद्योगत्वमिति, तदर्थमाह—नातपस्विनो योगः सिध्यतीति॥

 शरीरादिपोषणाभिरतचित्तस्य कायेन्द्रियमनः खेदपरिहारपरायणस्यात्यन्तशरीराद्यात्मत्वदर्शिनः सुकुमारतरंमन्यस्य न योगः सिध्यतीति तपस उपादानम्॥

किञ्च—अनादिवासनाचित्रा—विषयग्रहणवासनाभिरनादिकालाभिरुपरचितविचित्रभावा।तथा प्रत्युपस्थितविषयजाला—वर्तमानकाला विषया एव जालं,तेन च वर्तमानविषयाख्येन जालेन आनायेन झषानिव चित्तं अशुद्धिः पाशयति या सा प्रत्युपस्थितविषयजाला सती यस्मात् नान्तरेण तपः तपसा विना सम्भेदं विनाशम् आपद्यते,असम्भिन्नाशुद्धेश्चित्तस्य कुतः समाधिः इति तत्सम्भेदनाय च तपस उपादानम्।तच्च तपः चित्तप्रसादनं समाध्यन्तरङ्गं अबाधमानमनेनासेव्यमिति योगा मन्यन्ते। चित्तप्रसादार्थत्वात्तपसस्तमेव चेद्बाधेत तादर्थ्यमेव हीयेत॥१॥

 Question—How can austerity which is different of the nature of causing pain to the body have the capacity to achieve yoga through steadying the mind? As far as the study of the scriptures and devotion to Īśvara are concerned they have the capacity towards yoga because of their internal nature. It is therefore said "nātapa... dhyati" (a man without practice of austerity cannot achieve yoga). One who looks upon the body, etc., as the self, as very delicate, having his mind inclined towards protecting the body, etc., (and) engaged in averting pain to the body, sense-organs and mind cannot achieve yoga-therefore there is the inclusion of austerity.

 Moreover, "[anādi... trā](http://# "The bhāṣya reading is “anādikarmakleśavāsanācitrā” whereas the Vivaranakāra has "anādivāsanācitra". ")"= (the mind) is coloured by the collection through begnningless time, of latent-impressions of acquisition of knowledge of sense-objects.So also "pratyu ... jālā" = it is entrapped in the net of sense-objects which are present; therefore, through the net in the form of the present sense-objects the mind is trapped like the fish; when that net of sense-objects is present "nāntareṇa... upādānam" without self-restraint it cannot be destroyed; how can that mind whose impurity has not been destroyed achieve samādhi—therefore, in order to get rid of that “tapasa aupādānam" (self-discipline is mentioned). "tacca....[manyante](http://# "The bhāṣya has “manyate" but the Vivaraṇakāra has "manyante".")", i.e., different [yogas](http://# "It appears that the Vivaraṇakāra is talking about different types of yogas all aimed at purifying the mind. Or he is indicating each one of the limbs like yama, niyama, etc., as yoga, which would not be technically correct as only samādhi (the last), is considered to be yoga or the aṇgī whereas the others are aṇgas.")including samādhi (are to be practised for that purification, it is believed). Since it is aimed at the clarity ( purity) of the mind, if austerity (self-discipline) obstructs that, then it will destroy its own purpose.



 स हि क्रियायोगः—

 That kriyā-yoga (is)

समाधिभावनार्थः क्लेशतनूकरणार्थश्च ॥२॥

 For the sake of bringing about samādhi and for the sake of minimising the kleśas (afflictions).

 स ह्यासेव्यमानः समाधिं भावयति क्लेशांश्च प्रतनूकरोति।प्रतनूकृतान्क्लेशान्प्रसंख्यानाग्निना दग्धबीजकल्पानप्रसवधर्मिणः करिष्यतीति,तेषां तनूकरणात्पुनः क्लेशैरपरामृष्टा सत्त्वपुरुषान्यतामात्रख्यातिः सूक्ष्मा प्रज्ञा समाप्ताधिकार प्रतिप्रसवाय कल्पिष्यत इति॥

 That kriyāyoga, when practised (properly), brings about samadhi and weakens considerably the kleśas. The kleśas, when considerably weakened, become like burnt-up seeds through the fire of prasaṃkhyāna and are made unfit to give rise (to saṃsāra). When they are weakened there arises the subtle insight which is the discriminate discernment between the intellect and puruṣa.

 “sa hi kriyāyogaḥWith the idea of clarifying the purpose of kriyāyoga (and) to indicate its achievement of the purpose of [another](http://॑# "kriyāyoga is to achieve samādhi for puruṣa.")he says *samādhibhāvanārthaḥ kleśatanūkaraṇārthaśca.*

 Question—

How does it have this twin purpose?

 Answer—

"sa hi...tanūkaroti", i.e., combined with other means to yoga it brings about sam*ā*dhi (and weakens the[afflictions](http://# "The Vivaraṇakāra has different readings. Instead of “pratanūkaroti")).He will later sayyogāngānuṣṭhānād...[vivekakhyāteḥ.](http://# "YS, II.28.")

 Thus he says "[tanūkṛtān....kariṣyati](http://# "Again the Vivaraṇakāra has ")”, i.e., because of the weakening of the afflictions due to repeated practice of right (correct) knowledge (insight) which arises, they (afflictions) are like seeds which have their potency to sprout burnt; therefore they are “aprasavadharmiṇaḥ” they who do not have any birth; are ones without birth; not giving birth and having this nature (is what is denoted by) “aprasavadharmiṇaḥ";



therefore kriyāyoga will make them "aprasavadharmiṇaḥ" = devoid of the power to give rise to any birth.

 तेषां तनूकरणानुजन्मा पुनः क्लेशैरपरामृष्टा सत्वपुरुषान्यतामात्रख्यातिः समाप्ताधिकारा प्रज्ञा प्रतिप्रसवाय \[कल्पिष्यते\] संसाराभिमुखतायै पुनर्न कल्पिष्यते॥

 यद्यपि शास्त्राचार्योपदेशेन योगाङ्गानुष्ठानादृतेऽपि सत्वपुरुषान्यतामात्रख्यातिरुपजायते, तथाऽपि न क्लेशाधर्मादीनतीवातिरस्कृत्य सा जायेतेति पुनः पुनः क्लेशादिभिः परामृश्यत इत्येतद्दर्शयति पुनः क्लेशैरपरामृष्टेत्यनेन॥२॥

  "teṣām...[kalpiṣyate](http://# "The reading available is ")". (The weakened afflictions...) are not fit again to enter (come face to face with) the circle of births and [deaths](http://# "They are absorbed into their final cause.").

 Even though there arises discriminate-discernment regarding the intellect and [puruṣa](http://# "Insight into the difference in nature of the intellect (sattva) and puruṣa is what is known as anyatākhyāti in the system."),just by guidance from the guru and through instructions in the śāstras (authoritative books) without practising the (various) means to yoga still, the words “punaḥkleśairaparāmṛṣṭa” indicate that unless the afflictions, adharma and so on, are uprooted (abolished) totally that (prajñā) will not come into being (and) one will be troubled by the afflictions again and again.

 अथ के ते क्लेशाः ? कियन्तो वा ? इति—

 What are the afflictions ( kleśas) and how many are they ?

**अविद्याऽस्मितारागद्वेषाभिनिवेशाः क्लेशाः ॥ ३ ॥**

 Avidyā (misapprehension),asmitā (sense of I), rāga (attachment), dveṣa (aversion) and abhiniveśa (clinging to life) are the kleśas.

 क्लेशा इति पञ्च विपर्यया इत्यर्थः। ते स्यन्दमाना गुणाधिकारं। द्रढयन्ति, परिणाममवस्थापयन्ति,कार्यकारणस्त्रोत उन्नमयन्ति, परस्परानुग्रहतन्त्रीभूत्वा कर्मविपाकं चाभिनिर्हरन्तीति।

  This means that the five kleśas are five kinds of misapprehension. When they are active they strengthen the sway of the gunas (sattva, rajas, and tamas), they establish change, they bring about the flow of cause and effect; depending on each other for mutual benefit, they achieve the fructification of action.

 के ते क्लेशाः स्वरूपेण, कियन्तो वा संख्यया इति संख्यास्वरूपप्रतिपादनार्थं सूत्रं प्रणीयते—अविद्यास्मितारागद्वेषाभिनिवेशाः क्लेशाः एषामेकैकस्य लक्षणं सूत्रैरेव व्याख्यायिष्यत इति \[न\] व्याख्येयत्वे यत्नः क्रियते, व्याख्येयं त्वेतावदेव॥

  यथा प्रमाणविपर्ययविकल्पादयः परस्परभिन्नाः, न तथा क्लेशानां विपर्ययाद्भेदः। किन्तर्हि? विपर्ययस्यैवैते भेदा इति। कस्मात्? विपर्ययभावभावित्वादित्येतदाह—पञ्च विपर्यया इत्यर्थः॥



 “[ke...iti](http://# "The bhāśya has an additional ")”= Now what is the nature (of the kleśas) and how many ( are they)? In order to indicate the nature and number (of the kleśas) he composes the (following) sūtra *avidyāsmitārāgadveṣābhiniveśāḥ kleśāḥ.*

* *The definition of each one of these will be explained later on through (different) sūtras; therefore no attempt is made to give an explanation (right now); only this much (what follows) will be explained.

 While correct knowledge, misapprehension, mental [construction](http://# "The sūtra reads... pañcakleśāḥ in most texts."), etc., are different from each other it is not so with regard to the difference between the afflictions and misapprehension. How is that so? These are different forms of misapprehension alone. How is that so? As they all come to have the nature of misapprehension it is said (by Vyāsa) “pañca viparyayā ityarthaḥ".

 ननु च यथा वृत्तिभेदव्याख्याने प्रमाणवृत्तेः “प्रत्यक्षानुमानागमाः प्रमाणानि” इति त्रिधा भेदस्तत्रैव व्याख्यातः, तथा कस्मात्तत्रैवास्य विपर्ययस्यापि भेदः पञ्चधा नोपव्याख्यातः? चित्तवृत्तिरेव च विपर्यस इत्युक्तम्। तथा चोदाहतं, सद्विषयेणैकचन्द्रदर्शनेन द्विचन्द्रदर्शनं बाध्यते इति॥

 Objection — But then, while explaining the different modifications (of the mind) he explained the different kinds in the case of the modification of correct knowledge as [*pratyakṣā... pramāṇāni*](http://# " YS, I.6."),in that context itself. In a similar manner, why is it that he did not explain there itself the fivefold nature of misapprehension as [well](http://# "YS, I.7."). He mentioned misapprehension as a modification of the mind and he also gave an example there (in the following words) "[sadviṣayeṇa...bādhyata iti](http://# "YS, I.8.")".

 Answer — There is no defect in that, as the afflictions are not mental modifications. The afflictions are not thoughts but the modifications (of the mind) are thoughts. The afflictions are the impurity of the mind, just as cataract (timira) is in the case of the eye. When there is separation from the dirt of afflictions there will be an absence of thoughts of misapprehension of the mind.

 यदि हि प्रत्यय एव विपर्ययः, तदा यथा क्लेशनिरोधेऽपि योगिनः स्मृतिप्रमाणप्रत्यया भवन्ति तथा विपर्ययोऽपि भवेत्। न तु विपर्ययः क्षीणक्लेशानाम्। तस्माच्चक्षुष इव अयथार्थग्रहणनिमित्तं प्रत्ययस्य मलं विपर्यय इत्युच्यते॥

 तस्माच्चावृत्तित्वाद्वृत्तिभेदत्वेन न तत्र क्लेशा व्याख्याताः। तथा चोक्तम्—“चित्तमलप्रसङ्गेनाभिधायिष्यन्ते” इति क्लेशानां न वृत्तित्वं, मलत्वमेवेत्यभिप्रायेण। अभेदोपचारेण तु प्रत्ययेन सामानाधिकरण्यं, यथा धूमो मलैरग्निं गर्भादशान्तवृत्तास्तथा ज्ञानमेतेनेति, (?) तथैवात्रापि॥



 Question—If misapprehension is only a thought then just as the yogīhas thoughts (like) memory and correct knowledge even when the afflictions are restricted, similarly misapprehension can also happen.

 Answer—Misapprehension does not occur when the afflictions are weakened. Therefore, as in the case of the eye, misapprehension is the dirt which causes knowledge to grasp what is false.

 Again it (misapprehension) cannot be understood nor explained without recourse to thought. Therefore it is explained through a thought process as 'viparyayo[vṛttiḥ](http://॑# "The Vivaraṇakāra has a different reading of the bhāṣya; ")'.Thus the modifications are qualified by afflictions as "[kliṣṭākliṣṭāśceti](http://# "These words do not occur either in the sūtra 1.6. or in the enunciation to it. The Vivaraṇakāra just takes viparyaya from the sutra and vṛtti from the bhāṣya and states it here.")”.It is not logical to qualify modifications (of the mind) through modifications (of the mind) [themselves](http://# "In the introduction to YS, 1.6.").[There](http://# "That will lead to a logical fallacy, a kartṛkarmavirodha, where the qualifier itself becomes the qualified.") they are explained as caused by afflictions. And it is not logical to state that modifications (of the mind) are caused by modifications (of the mind).

 Because of (all these reasons) not being a modification (of the mind) and being different from a modification, the afflictions were not explained there. And it is stated (there) "[cittamala.....nte](http://# "Cf. bhāṣya on YS, I.5.")";thus the afflictions are not modifications (of the mind) and the idea is that they are of the nature of impurity. In the figurative use of identity it has the same locus as [thought.](http://# "Bhāṣya under 1.8, states that these afflictions will be explained later in the context of the impurities of the mind.") Just as by indwelling in fire, smoke makes it disturbed (without the flames being smooth), so also knowledge is distrubed by this ([affliction](http://# "Both thought and affliction are spoken of as identical figuratively and they both have the same locus as well, i.e., the mind.")). Similar is the case here [also](http://# "The same locus of knowledge and the afflictions as well as the distraction the afflictions cause in knowledge, is brought out by this analogy. But the construction is not easily intelligible. Will Śankara the BSBh. author write such a style? Or has the scribe missed out some words connecting the various ideas? As it stands there is no justification in reading verses III.38 and 39 into this context as Trevor Leggett has done.").

किञ्च—कर्मविपाकांश्चाभिनिर्वर्तयन्ति। कर्म त्रिविधं, तद्विपाकांश्च जात्यायुर्भोगानिति॥३॥

 He (Vyāsa) indicates their opposition to (right) knowledge (through the words)



"[te spandamānā](http://॑# "This line makes it appear as if something is missing in the earlier portion. ")" and so on. "spandamānāḥ" = springing forth through processes of thought; i.e., they are not active on their own accord (and) they are like colour, etc., in a [cloth](http://# "The reading available is ")."guṇādhikāram draḍhayanti" = they strengthen the capacity for activity (i.e., activity under the sway of the guṇas). The mind is never devoid of the capacity to act when they (afflictions) are active (throbbing with activity).

 "pariṇāmamavasthāpayanti" = it only means that they bring about change (constantly) again and again. “kārya...yanti" = they increase the flow of activity of the limbs of the body like the eyes, etc.

 Question— How do they do this?

 In answer to that he says "paraspara....tva” = avidyā, [etc](http://# "Like a quality depending on its support for action, afflictions function through thought processes.").,act mutually as causes and effects (to bring about activity).

 Moreover "[karma...yanti](http://# "avidyā, asmitā, rāga, dveṣa, and abhiniveśa.")".i.e., activity is of three kindsand its results are birth,span of life and [experiences](http://# "Instead of ").

**अविद्या क्षेत्रमुत्तरेषां प्रसुप्ततनुविच्छिन्नोदाराणाम्॥४॥**

 Avidyā is the breeding ground of the others whether they be dormant, weakened, interrupted or fully manifest.

** **अत्र अविद्या क्षेत्रं प्रसवभूमिः उत्तरेषां अस्मितादीनां चतुर्विधविकल्पानां प्रसुप्ततनुविच्छिन्नोदाराणाम्।

 Amongst these (afflictions) avidyā is the field (or) the breeding ground of the later asmitā, etc., in their dormant, weakened, interrupted or fully manifest state.

 Of these (four), what is the dormant state? It is the presence in the mind (of asmitā, etc.) in a potential state, in the form of a seed. Its awakening is its coming face-to-face with its object. In the case of one in whom prasaṃkhyāna has arisen, the seeds of kleśa being burnt, this awakening is absent, even when face-to-face with its object; for how can a burnt seed germinate? Therefore, he whose afflictions are weakened (and) who is fortunate, is said to be in his last birth. It is in him that the fifth stage of the afflictions which is the burnt-seed stage is present and nowhere else. In that stage, though the kleśas are present their seed power has been burnt; therefore, even when face-to-face with its objects there is no awakening (of these kleśas). Thus, the dormant state and the non-sprouting of the burnt seed stage has been mentioned.





तनुत्वमुच्यते—

प्रतिपक्षभावनोपहताः क्लेशास्तनवो भवन्ति।तथा विच्छिद्य विच्छिद्य तेन तेनात्मना पुनः पुनः समुदाचरन्तीति विच्छिन्नाः। कथम्? रागकाले क्रोधस्यादर्शनात्।न हि रागकाले क्रोधः समुदाचरति। रागश्च क्वचित् दृश्यमानो न विषयान्तरे नास्ति। नैकस्यां स्त्रियां चैत्रो रक्त इत्यन्यासु स्त्रीषु विरक्तः। किं तु तत्र रागो लब्धवृत्तिः, अन्यत्र तु भविष्यद्वृत्तिरिति। स हि तदा प्रसुप्ततनुविच्छिन्नो भवति। विषये यो लब्धवृत्तिः स उदारः।

 (Now) the weakened state is being spoken of.The afflictions, when over-powered by (their) opposite (thoughts), become weak. Similarly, when they are intercepted frequently and then again and again manifest themselves in their own nature they are called interrupted. How is this (possible) ? At the time of attachment anger is not seen; thus at the time of attachment anger is not manifest. When attachment is felt towards one object it is not as if it is non-existent with reference to another object. Just because Caitra is attached to one woman (at present) it does not imply that he is disinterested in other women. But the fact is that in the one, attachment is active (now), while in the other, it will become active in the future. This (future activity) is at that moment either dormant, weakened or interrupted. That which is active with reference to an object is (known as ) fully manifest.

 

सर्व एवैते केशविषयत्वं नातिनामन्ति।

 कस्तर्हि विच्छिन्नः प्रसुप्तः तनुरुदारो वा क्लेशः?इति—उच्यते—

सत्यमेवैतत्, किन्तु विशिष्टानामेवैतेषां विच्छिन्नादित्वम्। यथैव प्रतिपक्षभावनातो निवृत्तः, तथैव स्वव्यञ्जकाञ्जनेनाभिव्यक्त इति।

 सर्व एवामी क्लेशाः अविद्याभेदाः।कस्मात्? सर्वेष्वविद्यैवाभिप्लवते।यदविद्यया वस्त्वाकार्यते तदेवानुशेरते क्लेशाः विपर्यासप्रत्ययकाले उपलभ्यन्ते क्षीयमाणाञ्चाविद्यामनु क्षीयन्त इति॥४॥

 All these do not go beyond the sphere of the kleśas. In that case which is the interrupted, the dormant, the weakened or the fully manifest kleśa? In answer to that it is said—that is (indeed) true. But only when they are thus distinguished are they called interrupted and so on. Just as by contemplation on opposite thoughts they cease to be, so also they manifest themselves through the appearance of their causes.

 All these (different) kleśas are varieties of avidyā How is this so? Avidyā alone permeates them all. When an object is given a form through avidyā, then the kleas are invariably connected with it. They are present when there is misapprehension and when avidyā is weakened they also get weakened.

 avidyā kṣetramuttareṣām prasuptatanuvicchinnodārāṇām.

 Question — How are avidyā and others misapprehensions?

 The answer is given through the sūtra [itself](http://# "'YS, II.4."). "avidyā . . . bhūmiḥ” = (avidyā)

is



the ground furthering its own interest; just as the earth (allows the growth of ) grass, creepers, groups of trees and shrubs which are not different from itself, so also from avidyā each one of the fourfold asmitā, etc., which are not different from misapprehension (come into being), “[prasupta....avidyā](http://# "The Vivaraṇakära has the following readings instead of what is available. Thus ")”(in their various forms like dormant, weakened, interrupted and fully manifest).

 Thought processes which are misapprehensions depending on it (avidyā), benefit themselves. Therefore it is avidyā alone which changes into the fourfold form of asmitā and the others.

 तत्र का प्रसुप्तिरिति।अस्मितादीनां प्रसुप्तिर्नाम धर्म उच्यते,नाविद्यायाः।कारणत्वात्। सर्वास्मितादिविकल्पेष्वनुगमात्सर्वदा प्रबुद्धैव सा,न प्रसुप्ता।प्रस्वपने व्यवहाराभावात्। अस्मितादीनामन्यतमस्य प्रसुप्तावन्यतमस्यावस्थानमवश्यमेव। अन्यथा क्लेशान्तरस्योद्भव एव न स्यात्। तस्मादस्मितादीनामेव चतुर्णां प्रसुप्तादिचतुर्विकल्पत्वम्॥

 चेतसिशक्तिमात्रप्रतिष्ठानमित्यस्य व्याख्यानं करोति—

बीजभावोपगम इति। यथा बीजं सदेवानङ्कुरीभवदपि भूमिगतं तिष्ठति, तथा चेतस्यस्मितादयः शक्तिरूपेणानभिव्यक्तस्वरूपाङ्कुराव्यवतिष्ठन्ते॥

 तस्य प्रबोध इति — तस्य क्लेशस्यास्मितादेः प्रबोध उद्भवः आलम्बने विषये सम्मुखीभावः स्वव्यञ्जकाञ्जनस्य॥

 “tatra kā prasuptiḥ" = the property of asmitā and others like (being) dormant is mentioned (but) not that of [avidyā](http://# "Avidyā has no shades as it is the basis of asmita, etc. It is the basis of the others which can have different forms of existence."),because it is the cause (of the others). As she (avidyā) underlies all the misunderstanding like asmitā, etc., she is always awake and (never) asleep (dormant), as there is no activity in the sleep [state](http://# "Activity in a worldly sense."). On the other hand, when each one of these (four), i.e., asmitā, etc., is dormant the other one is necessarily present. Otherwise there will be no coming into being of any other [affliction](http://# "One sees pleasure, pain, etc., not all present at the same time in one person. Therefore it will have to be inferred that when one is present the other affliction is dormant."). That is why there is the fourfold differentiation of dormant and so on, in the case of the four asmitā, etc.

 He explains "cetasi....[sthānam](http://# "The Vivaranakära has ")”.“bījabhāvopagamaḥ". Just as a seed (potentially) active, though not presently sprouted, lies (dormant) inside the earth, so also asmitā, etc., lie in the mind in a potential state without being manifested in their sprouted nature.

 "tasya prabodha" is the rise of the afflictions asmitā and so on; i.e., its manifestation in the presence of the object which stimulates its rise.

 तत्रैतत् स्यात्,सर्वदैव क्लेशस्य बीजभावोपगमः प्रबोधश्च नियमेन स्यादिति। तत आह—प्रसंख्यानवतः सम्यग्दर्शनाभ्यासवतः अदग्धक्लेशबीजस्य योगिनः संमुखीभूतेऽप्यालम्बने नासौ बीजभावोपगमः। दग्धस्य

 Question—There is this possibility that regularly, by turns, there will be the presence of the afflictions in the seed-state and its awakening into the manifested state at all times.

 In answer to that he says— "prasaṅkhyāna..." and so on. In the case of the yogi who has continuous true insight (the seeds of afflictions though not [(the seeds of afflictions though not burnt)](http://# "The reading given by the Vivaraṇakāna is "))do not have the capacity to become potential seeds, i.e., (give rise to afflictions) (even when the object is present face-to-face), “dagdhasya...", i.e., because of being burnt (because of not having the potential for maturity) "kutaḥ... prabodhaḥ" (whence can there be) its germination? It is only a seed present (in a potential state of germination) which will sprout when it comes into contact with its efficient causes like soil, water, etc., and not a seed which has its seed-potential burnt; so is the case with afflictions.

 यद्येवम्, एषा पञ्चमी कस्मादवस्था नोक्ता दग्धप्रसुप्ततनुविच्छिन्नोदाराणामिति— न—असाधारणत्वात्। न हि सर्वदेहिनां साधारणी पञ्चमी क्लेशावस्थायोगिन एव हि सा, ततो नाम्नायते॥

 Question— If it is so then why is this [fifth state](http://# "The burnt-stage.")not mentioned as burnt, dormant, weakened, interrupted and fully manifest.

 The answer is— it is not mentioned as it a [special state](http://# "This is not the common property of the afflictions but one which occurs only in the case of a yogī."). The fifth stage of the afflictions is not common to all the people. That state belongs only to the yogi, that is why it has not been enumerated.

 Question—Why is it a special state? In answer he says "tatraiva... nyatra", i.e., only in the case of one who has continued practice of true insight (is it burnt, not elsewhere).

 "kṣīṇa ....deha iti" = the yogī is mentioned as one with true insight. “[tatrai...sāmarthyam](http://# "The Vivaraṇakāra has “tadānīm” instead of “tadā” and has “dagdham” before “bījasāmarthyam”, and omits  ")”.This is similar to seeds like barley seeds, etc., having the potential to sprout losing that seed-potential when fried. "[viṣaya... prabodhaḥ](http://# "The Vivaraṇakāra has not got the word ")”, i.e., in thecase of one with true insight, as there is only the stage of the residual latent-impres-



[sions](http://॑# "It now becomes clear that this is the jīvanmukti stage or the last stage of samprajñāta."),(he resembles) the arrow which is freed from its target.

 "uktā prasuptiḥ". (the dormant stage has been mentioned). Moreover, in the case of the yogī, the non-awakening of the afflictions whose seeds are burnt has been [described](http://# "This is just a repetition or summary of what went before.").

 He now "tanutvam...ucyate" = (describes the weakened stage) (through the words) "pratipakṣa..." and so on; i.e., those are described as weakened, i.e., which are of feeble influence, as they have been made powerless by reflecting on the opposite (thoughts) like the inferior nature of the body, etc.

 "tathā... vicchinnāḥ". (The interrupted are) those which do not show themselves (appear) in the intervals when other thoughts arise but (then) again manifest themselves in the same form in which they appeared earlier. Or they are those which do not manifest themselves in succession (one after another) in their true form, during [intervals](http://# "While in the former description their total absence is stressed in the latter it is only their manifest nature which is being denied.").

 तथा रागश्च क्वचिद्दृश्यमानो न विषयान्तरे नास्ति। कुतः? विषयविरोधादत्र।पूर्वत्र रागेण विरोधादसमुदाचरणं क्रोधस्य। अत्र तु विषयाणामन्योन्यविरोधात्। न हि विषय एकस्मिन्नुपजनयति रागं विषयान्तरमपि तस्यैव रागस्योत्पादकम्॥

 तद्यथा—नैकस्यां स्त्रियां चैत्रो रक्त इत्यन्यासु विरक्तः। किन्तु तत्र रागो लब्धवृत्तिः यस्यां रक्तः। अन्यत्र भविष्यद्वृत्तिः अन्यासु स्त्रीषु स हि भविष्यद्रागव्यक्तिविशेषः तदा प्रसुप्तस्तनुर्वेति॥

 “katham”...(In order to answer the question as to how this happens) he gives the (following) example..."rāga...carati" (at the time of attachment, anger is absent).This is so because manifested modifications of the mind and manifested forms (of objects) are in opposition (to other forms and other [modifications which are not fully manifest](http://# "Modification as pleasure which belongs to the mind will be opposed to any other modification while it lasts; so also modification of the mind into the shape of an object will be opposed to any other experience while that lasts. ")).Thus when attachment is manifest (the other emotions) being [hidden](http://# "Only hidden but not destroyed, as they do appear later.")they exist in their own forms in an unmanifest manner, therefore they are interrupted.

 Thus (as Vyāsa says) "ragaśca...nāsti" (when attachment is there for one object it is not as if it is not there for another object). How is that so? Because there is an



opposition between objects here. In the previous example there was non-manifestation of anger because of its opposition to attachment. Whereas here it is the mutual opposition between objects (which is emphasised). When attachment is generated with regard to one object, that same attachment cannot be generated with reference to another object.

 Thus for example "[naikasyām...viraktaḥ](http://# "The Vivaraṇakāra does not have the bhāṣya reading ")”. “kintu . . . vṛttiḥ”, i.e., (it is manifest) towards one to whom he is attached; "anyatra.....[prasuptatanurveti](http://# "The Vivaraṇakāra has an additional ")".i.e., with regard to other women the same modification is characterised by a future manifestation of attachment (and at the moment it is dormant or weakened).

 Objection—

But then, what is the purpose of the bhāṣya statement that (attachment is seen towards one object) and so on?

 Objection—

But then, (it is known that) this is the nature of attachment, that in this manner, due to the presence of different objects, attachment has the nature of being manifested and having a future manifestation. All this is true. Still it is not relevant to the point under discussion. The topic begun is discussion on [interruption](http://# "Interrupted afflictions ")and this is not a discussion on interruption; nor is there a connection with the fully manifest state which is to be described (just after) as there is no expectation of this in that [state](http://# "Ākānkṣā is expectation which is one of the conditions needed to be satisfied in a meaningful sentence. In order to understand 'udāra' it is not necessary to understand 'vicchinna' or 'viccheda'. So the objection.").

 Objection—

In that case, this is just what is left of the [former](http://# "The answer is given as to how this can be derived from the earlier one. Thus it is what is left out and is implied by the other three.").Why does one say so? It is thought that there is just no characteristic like being interrupted apart from being dormant, weakened or fully manifest. How is that? Till such time as it becomes active it (the modification) is dormant. When it is defeated by an opposite thought, being of slow activity it is called weakened. And that (affliction) which has reached an active state is known as fully manifest. The interrupted is that which having sometimes manifested itself is again manifested (active). It is like the flow of the river Sarasvatī. For instance, when attachment is manifest anger is never seen to exist (at that moment). Therefore, there is no characteristic called interrupted as it is not seen (to exist).

 Answer—

If the interrupted (interruption) is not accepted because it is not seen (to



exist) then when attachment is existing in one place its non-existence in another place can be its total absence.

 नन्वस्त्वेवाभावः, अन्यत्रादर्शनात्।न हि। कस्मात्? क्वचित् दृश्यमानत्वादेव।न हि विषयान्तराभिमुखो न भवतीति धर्मिण्यपि चेतसि नास्ति। न हि चक्षुः कदाचिद्रजाभिमुखं न भवतीति घटाभिमुखप्रवृत्तं सन्नास्ति। घटाभिमुखदर्शनादेव। तदेतदाह—क्वचित् दृश्यमानो न विषयान्तरे नास्तीत्यादि।

 तथा क्रोधोऽपि रागेणोद्भूतेनाभिभूतत्वाद्विच्छिन्नदर्शनो भविष्यति,सरस्वतीस्रोतोवदेव। स हि रागो विषयान्तरे प्रसुप्तः तनुर्वा। तदाभिमुख्येनादृश्यमानविशेषत्वात्॥

 Objection—Let it be total absence as it is not seen with regard to another.

 Answer—That is not so. Why? Because it is seen sometimes (again). Just because it is not manifest with regard to another object does not mean that it is not present in the[qualified mind](http://# "The mind is qualified with all these in their various forms.").For instance the eye when not facing an elephant and which is engaged in seeing a pot cannot be considered to be non-existent because of the fact that it is engaged in seeing a [pot](http://# "Existence in the world means the commencement of various experiences and thus the appearance in a continuous manner of these experiences. But when one experience like anger disappears for the present and surfaces again later one concludes that it belongs to the category of the interrupted stage. The only obstacle to the disappearance is when the afflictions are burnt-up; so in the absence of that this is the only way one can explain it."). Therefore, he (Vyāsa) says “kvacit . . . nāsti”.

 Thus when attachment arises anger also is seen to be interrupted because of its opposition (to attachment), similar to the interruption of the flow of the river Sarasvatī. That same attachment is either dormant or weakened with regard to another object as it is not seen at that moment with reference to the object in question (which is facing it).

 Question—

Then what is the difference between that which is dormant and that which is interrupted, since in both places what is common is its being invisible (unmanifest then).

 Answer—

As there is continuity because of the absence of mutual opposition, disappearance of the continuance of the manifestation of that which has commenced is (known as) the interruption of the unburnt (afflictions). But the dormant stage is



when the causes present (for manifestation) of the unburnt-seeds, which though absent by being vanquished by the overpowering opposition (to it), remains in a seed-form.

 Objection—But then, if this is so, there is a contradiction in the statement (of thebhāsya) “sa hi tadā prasuptastanurveti''[^669]; it is only the discontinuity of the manifestation of that which has begun which is seen by the appearance of another object[^670].

[^669]: "Earlier in the commentary under II.4. Vyāsa mentions this."

[^670]: "The opponent argues for the total disappearance of the previous experience for the new one to appear."

 Answer—

That is not so as the appearance of another object is the intended meaning of that. Appearance of another object means that the property (quality) of attachment is at that moment dormant, or weakened, but not attachment (as such ). Attachment is not dormant or weakened at all times by itself, because it is manifest sometimes. Anger dormant or weakened by itself is not manifest towards objects whenattachment is present.

 Or in order to indicate another example of the interrupted stage the commentatorsays “rāgaśca kvacit”[^671] and so on. How is this? He indicates two kinds of the interrupted stage. One is where there is the disappearance altogether (everywhere) of thecontinuity of that appearance which was manifest due to the overpowering influenceof the obstacle. Thus for example, he states "raga.... nāt".

[^671]: "Earlier in the commentary under II.4."

सर्वे चैते क्लेशविषयत्वान्नातिक्रामन्तीति।न हि शत्रुः प्रसुप्तोजनिष्यमाणो वा नापकरिष्यति ॥  

 Similarly, this is another kind (of interruption) which is manifest with reference toa particular object and is not manifest with reference to another object even when thecause (for manifestation) is there[^672]. For instance, Caitra who is attached to one womanshows no attachment towards other women even though they are present (in front ofhim). “tatra...vr̥ttiḥ”, i.e, with reference to some object that which is seen to beactive at present is to come into existence in future with reference to another object—

[^672]: "Like Caitra not interested in any other woman except his wife. Both his wife and other womentheoretically are the efficient causes for the appearance of desire or attachment. But it appears only withreference to his wife and not towards the others."

that is also the interrupted state[^673] the absence of anger for instance when attachment is present; (2) the absence of a modification like attachment, anger, etc., with reference to one object at present but whichcan also come into being in future with regard to another object.").

[^673]: "Thus the two kinds are (1



 He mentions the reason why it is not seen elsewhere (through the words) "sa hi...”, etc. In this context it is not his intention to indicate the dormant or weakened states (dormant or weakened will not serve the purpose). Be that as it may. There, what is intended by absence (non-manifestation) is the interrupted state.

 "viṣaye . . . udāraḥ".

 Objection— But then the dormant, weakened and interrupted (in truth) are not afflictions as they are not capable of giving rise to any effects (results). The dormant, weakened and interrupted in the states which govern the dormant, (weakened[^674])and interrupted states are not capable of giving rise to any effects. An enemy who is not born as yet is not capable of fighting (taking part in a
fight[^675]).Nor is it possible to take a bath in a place where the stream (flow) is interrupted. Therefore the statement should have stopped with 'avidyā is the field (basis) for the others'. What is the purpose served by talking about these dormant, weakened and interrupted states which are incapable of achieving any results.

[^674]: "''tanutā' has been left out in the reading which is probably an oversight of the scribe."

[^675]: "This is an epithet associated with many divinities as also Yudhiṣṭhira."

 Keeping this in mind he gives the answer (in the following words) "sarve..." and so on. An enemy does no harm to one who is asleep or to one who is to be born in future.

 "kastarhi ... kleśaḥ ...", i.e., it is not proper to divide them as such. One example alone should suffice. Apart from the fully manifest state no other will accomplish any purpose.

 "satya...". (This is true); still he refutes it (through the words) "kiṃtu ....ditvam", i.e., only those which have not abandoned the property of afflictions (are called interrupted, etc.). Even during the interrupted state the potency to do harm is not destroyed; therefore there is no harm (in their enumeration).

 Question—

If it is said that at that time they are ineffective then the answer is that the (next) statement prescribes meditating on opposite thoughts (in order to check these[^676]).With regard to an enemy who is unseen, who is asleep or who is yet to be born, it is not as if there is no need to prepare for fight. It is heard that Indra, out of

[^676]: "It is not a definite statement and can be understood differently. It can mean that for the moment it is ineffective but not always ineffective as when there is a need it will come into being. Therefore to extinguish it totally, meditating on the opposites has been urged."



fear of opposition,cut the foetus in the womb of Diti into seven parts[^677].The reason(for calling these afflictions) is also indicated by their own nature as follows:"yathaiva... abhivyaktiḥ" (they manifest themselves when their causes are present).Since they come into existence again then again disappear and yet again come intobeing, therefore even if they are in the dormant stage they have to be mentioned inorder to allow for meditation on opposite thoughts (to get rid of them) because theyare not beyond the sphere of being afflictions[^678].

[^677]: "Indra is constantly in fear of defeat and in one instance is said to have destroyed the daityas in the womb of Diti."

[^678]: "As they are within the sphere of afflictions they have to be overpowered through practices like meditation on opposite thoughts."

 He (Vyāsa) now concludes (through the words) "sarva...plavate". (These are allsub-divisions of avidyā) because in asmitā and other (afflictions) it is (avidyā alone)which is prominent, i.e., which is seen as manifest.

 Moreover, “yadavidyayā...” taking from (through avidyā ) the afflictions likeattachment, etc., come into being in connection with that object. As for instance,objects like women, etc., are to be shunned (avoided) but due to avidyā one thinksthat 'this is to be enjoyed' and gets attached to it with pride. When knowledge dawns(as a result of) dwelling on opposite thoughts one shuns the object.

 Question—

How is it that they (the afflictions) are connected with it (avidyā)?

 Answer—

\(1\) Since “viparyāsa....kṣīyante" they are different forms of avidyā? (2) Since asmitā and the other afflictions are destroyed along with the destruction ofavidyā. When avidyā is absent there is no possibility of any affliction coming intoexistence.

 Amongst them the nature of avidyā is being mentioned.



**अनित्याशुचिदुःखानात्मसु नित्यशुचिसुखात्मख्यातिरविद्या ॥५॥**

 Avidyā is the idea of permanence, of purity, of pleasure and of self in those whichare impermanent, impure, painful and not-self.

 There is an idea of permanence in non-permanent things such as the permanenceof earth, the permanence of the sky along with the moon and stars, the immortality ofthe gods &c.

 Similarly, there (is this idea) of purity in the impure, terribly disgusting body. Thewise consider this body to be impure due to its place of birth,due to its origin, due toits sustenance (in the body), due to its secretions, due to death and due to the need tokeep it artificially clean.

 This girl is beautiful like the crescent moon, her limbs appear to be made out ofhoney and nectar; she appears to have emerged from the moon; she has eyes whichare large like the petals of a blue lotus; with coquettish movements of the eyes sheseem to console the world (of men). What is being compared to what (here ) ? Thusthis is the misconceived idea of purity in impurity. Through this is explained the ideaof merit in demerit and the idea of usefulness in what is useless. Similarly he willmention the idea of pleasure in what is painful as 'To the discriminating all is pain due to the pains of (causing suffering in) the end, due to anguish, due to subliminal-impressions and due to the contrary nature of the guṇas.' (YS, II. 15 ). In this contextthe idea of pleasure is avidyā.

In thisconnection it is said 'All those who believing the animate or inanimate object to bethe self rejoice, thinking their prosperity to be their own prosperity and are sad thinking their troubles to be their own troubles, are unenlightened."

 This fourfold avidyā is the basis of this flow of kleśa and of the latent impressionsof karma, along with its fruition.

 This avidyā should be understood as a real substance like (the use of the words)'amitra ' (enemy) and 'agoṣpada' (a big place). Just as the word 'amitra' does notmean the absence of a friend nor just a friend, but means its opposite, i.e., an enemy;and just as the word 'agoṣpada' does not mean the absence of a cow's foot nor just acow's foot but is a large place different from both,so also avidyā is neither rightknowledge nor a negation of right knowledge;on the other hand,avidyā is a differentknowledge which is the opposite of true knowledge.

[^679]: "The introduction to sūtra II.5."

 Question**—**

What is the purpose of describing the nature of avidyā?

 Answer**—**

The commentator himself will explain that through the words "avidyāmūlamasya kleśasantānasya”[^680]and so on. When the nature of the basis of the group ofafflictions is unknown it is not possible to completely destroy it along with its roots;therefore he describes its nature.

[^680]: "Later on in the bhāṣya under II.5."

 anitya... avidyā. What is it? "anitye...." (in impermanent things) the misapprehension of its being permanent as for instance "dhruvā...divaukasaḥ iti"[^681].

[^681]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything new."

 Objection— But then, it is for this reason known (from what is said) that the earth,etc., are permanent[^682] “dhruvā”, etc. makes that clear according to the opponent."). How are these then considered to be effects?

[^682]: "The statement (quotation

 Answer**—**

There is no defect (in that) because of dependency (on something else).Earth, etc., are permanent when compared to human beings and so on. Their beingeffects and their being impermanent are proved through all proofs from the scripturalstatement, 'There was (not) the sky (then) neither the earth, nor the atmosphere[^683]andso on.

[^683]: "Not traced. As it stands it affirms the sky and denies the earth and atmosphere. But it could also denyall of the three; therefore 'not' has been put in brackets."

 Similarly "tathā.....kāye" with reference (to the body) which is impure, which isa house of the nature of a prison (for the self), which gives rise to extreme hatred(and) which creates great excitement, he mentions why there is disgust for it (throughthe verse) “sthānād..." and so on. “sthānādaśuciḥ[^684]"= there is impurity because it issituated (before birth) in the womb of the mother; “bījādaśucih" = the body is after all(the product of) the white and red seed, “upasthambhāt" = it is supported by wind(gas), bile and phlegm (and) their impurity is well-known. "nisyandāt" = due to therebeing a constant flow of dirt like sweat, urine, faeces, etc., “nidhanādapi" : becauseof death, one recalls the impurity (observed) for ten days by the relatives of the dead[^685].

[^684]: "A word by word meaning is given by the Vivaraṇakāra."

[^685]: "This definitely places the author in a region which observes ten days of impurity after death of a close relative."

 Objection—But then, if the body is impure by nature then the ( religious) rules forits purification are futile. In answer to that he says “kāya.....iti”, i.e., purity is imposed on it only through authoritative texts and by its own nature it is not pure.  

 Or, alternatively, instruments[^686] like the sattva-intellect, etc., being of the nature ofsattva are pure; thus in the body this purity is brought in and because that is pure this(body) is also pure[^687].When there is separation from the basis (support) of the sattva-intellect etc.; it is seen to be extremely impure.  

[^686]: "The instruments through which the body functions. In yoga, as there is the element of sattva in all products, that at least has to be granted its purity. Therefore an alternative explanation is attempted forthe impurity of the body."

[^687]: "The author uses reasoning for proving the purity as opposed to the scriptural authority given earlier."

 “tasmātpanditā .......viduḥ[^688]"= the (mention of the ) understanding of the wise is toremind one that those who are confused have the idea of purity (in that which isimpure). In the case of the deluded "aśucau....dṛśyate" (purity in impurity is experienced).

[^688]: "The Vivaraṇakāra uses words which are not there in the bhāṣya. After "

 “naveva... bhavati[^689] in place of "madhvamr̥tā."itis"amr̥tā..."")”.(The idea conveyed is) with regard to the true nature of thebody, etc., and how there can be the idea of purity in impure objects.

[^689]: "The Vivaranakara has the following readings: (a

 "etena....." (the idea of merit in demerit) is like that between one who is bound,(thinking) he is free. “tathaiva.....", i.e., the idea of possessing wealth in one who iswithout wealth as in the case of robbers. "tathā.....avidyā"[^690](thus) in the entire world(the idea of pleasure) in what is pain (is avidyā).

[^690]: "The Vivaraṇakāra just repeats the bhāṣya without adding anything new."

 "tathā.....ātmakhyātiriti" (thus there is the idea of self in the not-self both in theanimate and inanimate) like cows, etc., and pots, etc.

 In this context the question is raised as to who has in his mind this idea of self inthat which is the non-self.

 Objection— But then, the idea is only in (of) the mind.

 Answer—What is put forth is this—it is mentioned that avidyā is the modificationknown as misapprehension. It is the mind having obtained the nature of consciousness (by reflection) which considers itself to be conscious like 'I am the seer' or 'I amthe hearer, this is mine', etc., without distinction[^691].

[^691]: "Without distinguishing itself from the conscious self."


"tathaitadatra....."[^692].In connection with that it is said that (with reference to) allthings beginning with pradhāna, bodies, sense-organs, etc., up to particular objectsare either subject to experience or subject to inference or subject to scriptural proof;believing those animate and inanimate objects to be the self "saṃpadam anunandati" =one rejoices in their prosperity in their excellence "ātmasaṃpadam manvānaḥ” =thinking ‘I am prosperous through this wealth, this is my wealth' “tasya.....śocati” =(and) grieves about its destruction (loss) (thinking) 'My wealth is lost, I am destroyed.'"sa... buddhaḥ" = (all such persons) are falsely proud, ignorant.

 “esā ...[^693]"

[^693]: "The bhāṣya has “catuṣpadā” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “catuṣpadī"

 Objection—But then, along with the thought of merit in demerit' and 'demerit inmerit' it should be sixfold[^694].

[^694]: "Avidyā should be of six kinds instead of four if we include this, says the opponent."

 Answer—Not so; as this is included wherever possible within the fourfold division.

 “avidyā mūlam—" = (avidyā is) the seed which is the source of the continuousfunctioning of the afflictions ending with abhiniveśa (the clinging to life). In additionit means "karmāśayasya..." = ( avidyā is the basis) of the entire world of birth anddeath characterised by the three fold nature of birth, span-of-life and experience.

 "tasyāśca... " = (this) avidyā (should be known) as a different kind of substance.Why is this being mentioned ( here ) as it has already been said that it (avidyā) ismisapprehension having an object.

 Answer—This is the idea. The word 'avidyā' is a tatpurusa compound denotingnegation. This can either denote prominence to the second word as in the case of‘rājapuruṣa[^695]'or it can point to the importance of the first word as in the example‘ardhapippalī[^696]'.Therein if the first part (nañ) is important then (it would mean that)there is an absence of knowledge as authority[^696];" whenever there is connection withknowledge because of having the property of modification of the mind there will beunderstanding of it as another modification (like memory, etc., and) there will beunderstanding of something special which is uncertain. And then, as already defined,avidyā as misapprehension will become its technical name.

[^695]: "The king's man, thus pointing to the importance of the second part, i.e., man."

[^696]: "Half of a pepper — thus the half is what is important here."



 Question— Where is the defect in that?

 Answer — On hearing the word 'avidyā' doubt will arise (in the mind) (as folows). Is the technical meaning of the word well-known for the sake of dealing withhe authoritative texts (scriptures); for instance it is said 'In the world when wordshaving their meanings well-known are used in sūtras the same meanings should beunderstood. Or is the meaning something which does not belong to the word like 'iko guṇavṛddhi[^698]'.Then when the meaning of a word is not definite it will not be possible to function in the world using the word avidyā[^699].

[^698]: "Meanings which have special significance and are peculiar to their own areas as in this case, grammar 'Ika' stands for the letters i, u,r, l, 'guna' letters are e, o and vṛddhi letters are ai, au. As it is ambiguous and has no fixed meaning."

[^699]: "As it is ambiguous and has np fixed meaning."

 

The other case (alternative) is when both words are in the same case and the second pada (word) is prominent as in the example ‘nīlotpala' (blue lotus[^700] qualifying utpalamlotus). The qualified is 'utpalam' and the qualifier is 'nīlam'.")).In thatexample as well, there is no opposition (ambiguity) in the words and their meaningsand the relation of qualifier and qualified is proper.

[^700]: "Nīlam utpalam-both being in nominative singular but nīlam (blue colour

 But here (in our example) through 'nañ' (negation) cessation is indicated; andthrough the word 'vidyā' knowledge is indicated. Therein if, with relation to theprominent second word, i.e., vidyā, negation, i.e., nañ is subsidiary (becomes thequalifier) it will entail the non-existence of the meaning of the word (i.e., vidyā); inthat case it will destroy its own nature as the qualifier[^701]. Nor can the other pada beprominent (in that case).

[^701]: "Being a qualifier of a negative nature."

 He who starts to achieve some purpose but ends up by destroying that very purpose cannot have the nature of being subsidiary to the accomplishment of that purpose[^702].Nor can the end purpose be of any importance in that case. Therefore the

[^702]: "The same thing is being paraphrased again. If the end is not achieved the subsidiary is also destroyedin the process."



qualifier has to be of such a nature as to be within the control of the main purpose.Therefore (in this case) there is only indication of absence of something else in knowledge; the negation nañ by itself just serves a subsidiary purpose; therefore what isknown is just knowledge.[^703] for philosophical purposes comes out clearly here.")

[^703]: "The tendency to use language of grammar (or grammar of language

 

Thus coming to a conclusion he (Vyāsa) says “tasyāvijñeyam"; just as “yathā ...[^704]"(in a tatpuruṣa compound) when the first word is important as in the case of‘ardhapippalī' (it does not mean) absence of knowledge. As indicated, when thesecond word is important (in the tatpuruṣa compound) the (negation) has to functionas a subsidiary within the control of the main word (in this case vidyā) and not bydestroying it completely. Thus it is said in the section dealing with negation (nañ) inthe Vārttika[^705]—When one is asked to bring in a man who is not a brāhmaṇa it will result in a man who is just a brāhmana (by caste) being brought in[^706].(Therefore) in case of the second word (in the compound) being prominent, the negation functions as subordinate (to the second word[^707]).Thus (it is) in the example 'amitra'; is it similarin avidyā (as in the example agoṣpada[^708]).

[^704]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has “amitro no mitrābhāvaḥ"

[^705]: "Kātyāyana's Vārttika."

[^706]: "Mahābhāsya, II.2.6. Cf Leggett, op. cit., p. 189."

[^707]: "In order to avoid problems like the examples already given."

[^708]: "Somebody other than a friend and something other than correct knowledge."

 

Or it is like "yathā...antaram", i.e., it is another substance different from absence of a cow's foot or just a cow's foot (space visited by cows).

 Question—How is this so, when one (understands) the meaning as a cow's foot(space visited by cows) or as the absence of a cow's foot (space visited by cows)?

 Answer—It is said that due to usage one understands its meaning as nothing to dowith a cow’s foot.

 Question—How ?  

 Answer—The negation 'nañ' (here) has a meaning opposite to what is asserted. Itconveys the sense of absence of whatever it is used with[^709]."

[^709]: "Thus being used with 'goṣpada' here, it signifies the absence of a cow's foot and denotes the space."

अत्रासेवितग्रहणे पुनः क्रियमाणे च बहुव्रीहिरयं विज्ञायते, अविद्यमानसेवितोऽसेवित इति। (तस्मात्)एवमविद्या न प्रमाणं न च प्रमाणाभावः। किन्तु विपरीतं ज्ञानान्तरमिति॥५॥



 Therefore the word "agoṣpadam" can have three possible meanings: (1) the well-known meaning connected with 'goṣpada'; (2) just a cow's foot; (3) something different from a cow's foot. If it is taken to be a mere cow's foot then the usage of 'nañ'(negation) has not served any purpose. If the usage of 'nañ' in ‘'agoṣpada' conveysthe meaning of absence of something (here cow's foot) even then it has not served itspurpose.

 

Then if the meaning of 'goṣpada' is taken as that which is connected with thecontext even then 'nañ' will be used in a subordinate sense as it cannot be understoodas absolutely not used by the cows[^710]. Because even though there is the possibility of itsuse (by cows) in future the use of words is proper when it applies (equally) to all threetimes[^711]. The primary meaning (of the word agoṣpadam) is that when there is no connection with cows (in all three times), i.e., there was none in the past, there is nonenow and there will be none in the future. Therefore, if the meaning of negation is possible that alone is correct; (but it is not possible); so the desired meaning is neitherconnected with usage nor is it restricted only to the bare use (of space by cows). (Onthe contrary) what is denoted by the word "agoṣpadam" is 'space other than thatassociated with a cow's foot' (space used by a cow).

[^710]: "It is not possible to assert that cows do not use that place all the time. Therefore the negation will notbe conveying its main sense, i.e., the first option."

[^711]: "Past, present and future-which cannot be true here."

 

Question—How can its meaning be like the compound 'blue-lotus' having a relationship of qualifier and qualified, as there is an opposition between what exists andits absence[^712]. Here the opposition is the negating of knowledge itself; so it cannot be compared to the compound nīlotpalam.").By just indicating its absence (absence of knowledge), there can be noworldly dealings; therefore that subject with reference to which absence is predicatedthat itself is cognised as a different substance. Thus it is said, "We have the formgoṣpada when it is meant visited or not visited by cows[^713]."

[^712]: "Like a karmadhāraya (tatpuruṣa

[^713]: "Pāṇ. Aṣtā., VI.1.145."

 

If one understands the word as 'not visited' then it will be understood as a bahuvrīhicompound whose etymological explanation would be that which has no visit', i.e.,is'not visited'. Thus then "evamavidyā... iti[^714]".

[^714]: "The Vivaraṇakāra concludes with Vyāsa's words without adding anything new. He leaves out "

**दृग्दर्शनशक्योरेकात्मतेवास्मिता ॥ ६ ॥**

 

Asmitā is the feeling of identity between the power of seeing and the power bywhich one sees.

Puruṣa is the power of seeing, intelligence is the power by which one sees; thus the

appearance of identity of essence between these two is the kleśa known as I-sense.When the power of the experiencer and of the thing to be experienced, which arequite distinct and different from each other, are looked upon as if they are identicalwith each other, then experience is possible. When their real nature is known, thenisolation (liberation) is possible—how can there be (any) experience (then)? Thus itis said 'When due to delusion one fails to see that the highest puruṣa is differentfrom intelligence by its nature, its character and its consciousness he (commits theerror of) considering that to be the self.'

 "dṛgdarśanaśaktyorekātmatevāsmitā"

 He now describes the misapprehension known as asmitā. (Puruṣa) is the knower,the seer and he is the power. That by which one sees is seeing, it is the power of thenature of complete identification with the mind. dṛgdarśanaśaktyoḥ, i.e., of these twowhich are of the nature of seeing and identification (with it[^715]);ekātmateva = it is oneand it is the self, such a state is (a feeling of) oneness. By the use of the word iva[^716]heindicates the absolute difference (between the two). "ekasvarūpa... cyate", i.e., that‘I-thought’ in which no difference between the intellect and puruṣa is felt that 'I-thought' is the affliction called asmitā.

[^715]: "The Vivaraṇakāra analyses the meaning word by word."

[^716]: "In the sūtra."

 Earlier in the context of describing the mind as an instrument of puruṣa it was saidthat 'avidyā' is only a misapprehension like the idea of self in the non-self*.*[^717]Here, onthe other hand, the difference is that asmitā is a knowledge of identity 'as it were'between the intellect and puruṣa, a knowledge of oneness 'as it were' of their essential nature[^718].

[^717]: "Cf. YS, II.5, and bhāṣya therein."

[^718]: "In the one instance the experiences were being attributed to puruṣa but here the identity that isfeltbetween the intellect and puruṣa is referred to."

 Thus it is said "bhoktṛ...ktayoḥ" = these two are quite distinct "avibhāga...kalpate”, i.e., it is the affliction called asmitā that is the cause for experience. Whenthere is the ‘I-sense' there is connection with pleasure, pain and so on like 'I amhappy', 'I am sad', etc. Therefore it (the affliction) is of this nature.

 “svarūpa...iti" = When discrimination dawns in the form, 'There is no I, mind,etc.' then there is no mixing up of (the natures of) the intellect and puruṣa Only whenthe cause of identity between the 'I-sense' and the self (puruṣa) exists is there theeffect in the form of experience, when that cause is absent there is no experience.Without superimposing consciousness in the mind it is not possible to experience(know) either pleasure or pain. That which is the object of the thought of I (i.e., thesubject I-sense) is the support for the idea of pleasure, pain, etc. There is the samelocus in such statements as, 'I am happy', 'I am sad', etc[^719] and ideas like pleasure, pain, etc., is the same. Therefore theyI have the same locus."). Therefore the cause forexperience is the 'I-sense' called asmitā.

[^719]: "The locus of the 'I-sense' (subject

 Thus it is said “buddhitaḥ........mohena[^720]".The other (puruṣa) is “vibhaktam" = different from the intellect. In answer to the question, 'By what properties is it different?” he says “ākāra.....bhiḥ[^721]”– by identity with the modification (of the mind),“silena" = by identity with the intellect, "vidyayā" = by the nature of consciousness.Or “ākāreṇa” = by being pure and infinite, “śīlena" = having no movement becauseof having no change, "vidyayā" = by being the power of consciousness. By all theseproperties it is different from the intellect.  

[^720]: "Attributed to Pañcaśikhācārya."

[^721]: "Instead of “vidyādibhiḥ” the Vivaraṇakāra has “vidyābhiḥ”."

 तथा बुद्धेरपि आकारेण सुखदुःखमोहात्मकत्वेन, शीलेन प्रख्याप्रवृत्तिस्थित्यात्मना, विद्ययासर्वार्थाध्यवसायात्मकत्वेन पुरुषात् विभागः। इत्थमन्योन्यमाकारशीलविद्याभिर्विभक्तं पुरुषं अपश्यन् कुर्यात्तत्रतस्यां बुद्धौ आत्मबुद्धिंआत्मप्रत्ययं मोहेन लोक इति। विद्याशीलाकारैरत्यन्तविभक्तयोर्बुद्धिपुरुषयोरविभागइव तद्दर्शनमित्यनेनांशेनोदाहरणम्॥

Similarly (one can describe the properties of) the intellect as well. “ākāreṇa” =having the properties of pleasure, pain and delusion[^722],“śīlena” = having the nature ofillumination, activity and inertia. “vidyayā" = having the nature to determine all things(to decide)—(because of all these properties) it is different from puruṣa. In this man-

[^722]: "The three constituents sattva, rajas and tamas, give rise to such feelings."



ner, without distinguishing the puruṣa which is different (from the intellect) throughthe qualities of its make up, its characteristics, and its power of determination, onehas the conception of I (ātman) in that intellect through delusion. What is illustratedhere through this example is the appearance of identity, as it were, between the puruṣaand the intellect which are of a totally different nature with respect to consciousness,character and intrinsic nature.  

 

And "vibhaktam...buddhim" = (this identification) has already been mentionedas avidyā. Or all this can be explained as one whole example since asmitā (sense-of-I) is a division of ignorance. "apaśyam kuryāt", i.e., avidyā is ignorant of the truenature of puruṣa; and the cause of asmitā is the colouring of the mind by the seer andthe seen; and the ignorance (as it were) of puruṣa is its seership itself[^723].

[^723]: "Puruṣa has no ignorance in truth, but its role as seer itself, imposed on it due to the reflection, can becalled its ignorance."

**सुखानुजन्मा रागः॥७॥**

 

Attachment is that which follows (experience of) pleasure.

 

सुखाभिज्ञस्य सुखानुस्मृतिपूर्वः सुखे तत्साधने वा यो गर्धस्तृष्णा लोभः स राग इति॥ ७॥

 The hankering or thirst or greed for pleasure or its means which is preceded byremembrance of pleasure of one who knows pleasure is attachment.

 सुखानुजन्मा सुखानुशयी रागः। अनु जन्म, अनु उत्पत्तिर्यस्य सः। सुखानुशयी तथा दुःखानुशयीतिअन्येषां पाठः। सुखानुशयी रागः दुःखानुशयी द्वेष इति ते व्याचक्षते, सुखमनुभवितुं शीलमस्य स सुखानुशयी,तथा दुःखानुशयीति। उभयधाऽप्यनुजन्मतैव। तदेव ताच्छील्यम्। तथा च वक्ष्यति—'धर्मात्सुखं सुखाद्रागः ' इति॥

 कथं सुखानुशयित्वमिति तदाह—सुखाभिज्ञस्य सुखे आभिज्ञानमभिज्ञा यस्य स सुखाभिज्ञः सुखं यउपलब्धवांस्तस्य, सुखाभिज्ञस्य सुखानुस्मृतिपूर्वः सुखं पूर्वानुभूतमनुस्मरन् सुखे ह्लादे तत्साधने वाअगरुचन्दनादावनुरज्यते। तत्र योऽसौ गर्धः स उच्यते तृष्ण लोभो राग इति॥७॥

 "sukhānujanmā rāgaḥ[^724]", i.e., that which follows pleasure (is attachment). Thecompound anujanmā can be etymologically explained as that which rises after. Thereare other readings as sukhānuśayī and duḥkhānuśayī (the next sūtra) as well[^725].Theyread them as sukhānuśayī rāgaḥ (and) duḥkhānuśayi dveṣaḥ.Then (the compound)sukhānuśayī can mean that which has the nature of 'pleasure-experience' and similarly with duḥkhānuśayi[^726]. But in both cases it arises after[^727]; that is its real nature (inboth cases). Thus he will say later—'From virtue arise pleasure (and) from pleasureattachment.[^728]

[^724]: "The texts available now have sukhānuśayī instead of sukhānujanmā in the sūtra."

[^725]: "The author of the Vivaraṇa knew these variant readings as well."

[^726]: "The compound as split here will present problems when applied to duḥkhānuśayī. It will then meanthat which has the nature of 'pain experience'. On the other hand, splitting it as 'that which arises afterpleasure and that which arises after hatred' will be a straightforward explanation."

[^727]: "In the first it arises after pleasure and in the second it arises after pain."


[^728]: "Vyāsabhāṣya under YS, IV.11."


 In order to explain why there is the follow up of pleasure he (Vyāsa) says “sukhā-bhijñasya” and so on. One who recognises pleasure, i.e., one who has experiencedpleasure is a “sukhābhijñah”. “sukhānusmṛtipūrvaḥ" = He by recollecting the earlierexperienced pleasure gets attached to "sukhe" = pleasure or to “tatsādhane" suchobjects like agalloch (amyris aloes eaglewood[^729]), ' sandal paste, etc. (The hankering)for those (objects) is called (thirst, greed, attachment).

[^729]: "Type of tree in Eastern India whose hard inner wood contains a resinous substance which is fragrantwhen burning- Chamber's Dictionary."



**दुःखानुजन्मा द्वेषः॥८॥**

 A version is that which follows (experience of) pain.

 दुःखाभिज्ञस्य दुःखानुस्मृतिपूर्वादुःखे तत्साधने वा यो मन्युः, उज्जिहासा, क्रोधः, स द्वेषः॥८॥

 The feeling of wrath or the desire to hurt (others) or anger towards pain or itsmeans, which is preceded by remembrance of pain, in the case of one who knowspain, is aversion.

 दुःखानुजन्मा दुःखानुशयी द्वेषः। दुःखमुक्तम् 'येनाभिहताः प्राणिनस्तदपघाताय प्रयतन्ते' इति।दुःखाभिज्ञस्येति पूर्ववद्व्याख्यानम्। दुःखानुस्मृतिपूर्वो दुःखे तत्साधने वा सतस्करादौ यो मन्युरुज्जिहासाउद्धातुमिच्छा क्रोधः स द्वेषः। रागेण तुल्यं व्याख्यानं सर्वम्॥८॥

 “duhkhānujanmā dveṣaḥ”, i.e, that which follows pain (is hatred). Pain is described as that by which living beings are overcome and for the destruction of whichthey strive[^730].“duḥkhābhijñasya” is explained as before[^731]. “duḥkhānusmṛtipūrvo. (Dueto recollecting the earlier experienced pain) "yo manyuḥ...[^732]"(the wrath) desire to destroy, (or anger) towards pain or its means, like anything which is bad or contemptible, “sa dveṣaḥ” is hatred. All explanation here is similar to (that given in the earliersūtra) with regard to attachment.

[^731]: "As explained in the case of  "

**स्वरसवाही विदुषोऽपि तथा रूढोऽभिनिवेशः॥ ९॥**

 Clinging to life is that which flows by its own potency and which is firmly fixedeven in the minds of the learned as in that of the ignorant.

 सर्वस्य प्राणिन इयमात्माशीर्नित्या भवति 'मरणं माऽन्वभूवं, भूयासम्' इति।

All living beings have this craving for one's self ceaselessly—'would that I werenever to experience death; may I live.' And this craving for one's self cannot exist inone who has not experienced the nature of death. And from this the experience of aprevious life is inferred.

 

This same kleśa called abhiniveśa flows by its own potency. Even in a worm justborn, the fear of death which is the knowledge of annihilation not experienced eitherthrough direct perception, or through inference, or through scriptural evidence, makesone infer that the pain of death had been experienced in a previous life.

 

Just as this kleśa is seen present in those who are extremely ignorant so also it isfirmly fixed even in (the minds of) the learned who have realised the beginning andend of life. Why is this so? Because the experience of the pain of death being similarboth in the case of the learned and the ignorant, this latent impression is there (in bothalike).

 

स्वरसवाही विदुषोऽपि तथा रूढोऽभिनिवेशः स्वरसेन स्वभावेन चित्तस्याविद्यामात्रेण वोढुं प्रवर्तितुंशीलमस्य। वहतेरकर्मकस्यापि दर्शनात् यथा नदी वहतीति। अथवा स्वरसं स्वभावं वोढुं शीलमस्य स्वरसवाहीविदुषोऽपि सम्यग्दर्शनस्यापि। अपिशब्दादविदुष एव युक्तो मरणत्रास आत्मोच्छेदमानिन इत्यभिप्रायः।सम्यग्दर्शनस्यात्मानुच्छेदमानिनोऽयुक्त इति। तथा विमूढतरबुद्धिष्वात्मोच्छेददर्शिष्वयमभिप्रायो मरणत्रासोरूढोऽभिनिविष्टः स्थिरो यथा तथैव विदुषोऽप्यात्मानुच्छेददर्शित्वादयुक्तोऽपि रूढः॥

 "svarasavāhī viduṣo'pi tathā rūḍho'bhiniveśaḥ"

 (The word svarasavāhī can be exaplained as) that which due to only the ignoranceof the mind becomes one's natural behaviour. The root ‘vaḥ' is also seen used as anintransitive verb as in such cases as the river flows, etc.[^733]Or one can explain it(svarasavāhī) as the tendency of clinging on to one's nature, viduṣopi (which is seen)even in the case of the learned.[^734]By the use of the word api the idea conveyed is thatfear of death is proper in the case of the ignorant, i.e., those who believe in the destruction of the self and in the case of the discriminate wise one, who knows about theindestructibility of the self, it is improper.[^735]Thus, just as in the case of those who arevery ignorant and who believe in the destructibility of the self this fear of death isfirm, constant and fixed (in their minds) so also even in the case of the learned,though this is unreasonable due to his knowledge of the indestructibility of the self[^736],it is firmly fixed (in the mind).

[^733]: "The first explanation is by taking the root 'vaḥ' as intransitive and the second taking it as transitive."

[^734]: "If samyagdarśana is taken to mean one who has discriminate-discernment, then it will give rise to thequestion of whether such a one will naturally cling on to life. Therefore, the word samyagdarśana cannotfit in this context. Viduṣo can only mean a learned person."

[^735]: "The Vivaraṇa uses ‘ātmānucchedamāninaḥ' in the case of the wise one also-that cannot fit in thecontext. So the reading has to be ‘samyagdarśanasyātmānanucchedamāninaḥ”."

[^736]: "The reading again has to be ‘ātmānanucchedadarśitvāt' to make sense."

 How is this fear of death firmly fixed (in the mind) by its own nature. Since"sarvasya..." (there is this constant craving) in the form "maraṇam mānvabhūvam" =



may I not be destroyed (may I not die[^737]). Or there is this craving “bhūyāsam” = may Ibe associated (always) with good qualities, with good people and may there never beseparation from them. In the ignorant there is prayer for continuity of sensual pleasures as well as one's self[^738].  

[^737]: "In available texts the reading is "

[^738]: "Of course the foolish only understand the ego as the self and are not aware of the higher truth."

 Question—What does one learn from this craving?

 Answer— (is given through the words) “na cānanubhūta.." and so on. “etayāca" = by this craving for one's self "pūrva..." (one infers a previous existence).Thus it is said-There cannot be desire (for pleasure) unless pleasure was previouslyexperienced and there cannot be the desire for avoiding it (pain) unless pain had beenexperienced previously. Through this craving for the (continuity of the) self what isinferred is the previous experience of death for one who has not experienced pain ofdeath either directly or indirectly (in this life). And as that does not take place withoutbirth the experience of a previous life (is also inferred). And then it is inferred thatthere is a continuity of birth and death-experience again and again; and the idea isthat it is without beginning, "sa cāyam...".

 He explains the reason for the experience of death as follows—“pratyakṣa..." and so on. "ucchedadṛṣtyātmakaḥ"=the cause for achieving the destruction of one's(worldly) experience; "pūrva ... yati[^739]".“yathā...rūḍhaḥ”, i.e., (just as the affliction is seen) in worms (and inferior creatures) (it is seen in the wise as well).“pūrvāntikam[^740]”is bondage and “aparāntikam" is liberation. This (affliction is firmlyfixed) even in the case of one who has realised both bondage and liberation.

[^739]: "The Vivaraṇakāra is not explaining anything afresh but repeats what Vyāsa says."

[^740]: "The word is “pūrvāparāntikasya"

 Question—Then how is it firmly fixed in the (mind of the) wise one similar to thefoolish one?

 Answer—(In answer to that) he says "samānā[^741]..."and so on.

[^741]: "In Instead of "

 When the mind of a yogī has fulfilled the purpose of its existence and gets absorbed in prakṛti, those five kleśas, which have become like burnt-seeds, also getabsorbed along with it.

 Patañjali will (later) mention.

 'kleśamūlaḥ karmāśayaḥ[^742]'and sati mūle tadvipākaḥ[^743]; therefore, the afflictions arefit to be destroyed. And they have been indicated in order to be destroyed. And hewill mention the means for their destruction as dhyānaheyastadvṛttayaḥ[^744].In that context, it is not clear as to what object is to be destroyed by meditation. Is the object theburnt-seed stage of action (karma) and afflictions or does it have everything as itsobject.[^745].")

[^742]: "YS, II.12, i.e., kleśa is the basis of deposit of karma."

[^743]: "YS, II.13, i.e., when the basis of kleśa is there, then there is vipāka."

[^744]: "YS, II.11, i.e., the modifications are to be destroyed through meditation."

[^745]: "All stages of the afflictions and of action (karma

 In order to distinguish the object (relevant) he (Patañjali) commences this (following) sūtra—

te pratiprasavaheyāḥ sūkṣmāḥ.

 "te... gacchanti", i.e., it is thus said: The afflictions of the mind (of a yogī) whichhas achieved the goal of puruṣa, which has its seed capacity (to give rise to results)burnt by the fire of constant practice of discernment (insight), gets absorbed alongwith the absorption of the mind (in prakṛti); there is no dependence on the practice ofmeditation for the coming into being of absorption[^746]. That which is already burntneeds no burning nor does that which is powdered (crushed) into a paste needs further powdering (crushing). The mind (of a yogī) having accomplished its goal andnot having any more purpose for existing, withdraws itself.

[^746]: "In the case of such a yogī there is no need of meditation for the destruction of afflictions."

 स्थितानां तु बीजभावोपगतानाम्—

 Those kleśas which are actively present as seeds in the mind—



**ध्यानहेयास्तद्वृत्तयः॥११॥**

 Their modifications are to be destroyed through meditation.

** **क्लेशानां या वृत्तयः स्थूलास्ताः क्रियायोगेन तनूकृताः सत्यः प्रसंख्यानेन ध्यानेन हातव्यायावत्सूक्ष्मीकृता यावद्दग्धबीजकल्पा इति।यथा वस्त्राणां स्थूलो मलः पूर्वं निर्धूयते पश्चात्सूक्ष्मोयत्नेनोपायेन चापनीयते तथा स्वल्पप्रतिपक्षाः स्थूला वृत्तयः क्लेशानाम् सूक्ष्मास्तु महाप्रतिपक्षाइति॥११॥

 Those gross (active) modifications of the kleśas being weakened by kriyāyoga,are to be destroyed through meditation known as prasankhyāna, till they becomesubtle, i.e., till they become like burnt seeds. Just as gross dirt in clothes is first shakenoff and then the subtle dirt is removed by effort and other means, similarly, the grossmodifications of the kleśas can be fought easily, while the subtle ones need powerfulopposition.

 In answer to the question as to which afflictions need the help of meditation, etc.,(to be destroyed) he says "sthitānām... gatānāmiti[^747]".

[^747]: "Introduction to YS, II. 11."

 dhyānaheyāstadvṛttayaḥ. "kleśānām....tanūkṛtāḥ", i.e., the afflictions "tanū-kṛtāḥ” = (which have been weakened) already by self-discipline, study (of scriptures)and devotion to īśvara which are known to oppose the gross form (of afflictions) arenow reduced to a potential seed state due to being weakened. "prasaṅkhyānena...sūkṣmīkṛtāḥ = they are now to be (destroyed) through the great obstruction of constant practice of discriminate-discernment with great skill; and up to (their subtlestate); more than that “yāvaddagdhabījakalpāḥ" = till they become devoid of theirseed-potential[^748].

[^748]: "No more sprouting is possible and the kleśas would be totally burnt effectively."

 And how is that done? "yathā....apanīyate", i.e. (After the gross dirt is removed,later the deeper) dirt which is caused by grease, etc., (is removed by effort) and throughspecial means (ingredients) like salt, etc. Similarly, "tathā svalpa....mahāpratipakṣāiti” (the gross modifications of the afflictions) are obstructed by self-discipline, study(of scriptures), devotion to īśvara, and by the practice of various means to yoga likeyama, niyama, etc. “sūkṣmāstu....iti", i.e., the subtle afflictions which depend onthe seed potential need great obstruction like continuous bright effulgence of discriminate-discernment which is obtained by the practice of self-discipline, study of



the scriptures and so on[^749].

[^749]: "While the surface afflictions can be overcome by kriyāyoga the subtle ones need to be overcome bycontinuous practice of meditation."

**क्लेशमूलः कर्माशयो दृष्टादृष्टजन्मवेदनीयः॥१२॥**

 The latent deposit of karma (action) has kleśas as its basis and is to be experiencedeither in a seen or unseen life.

 तत्र पुण्यापुण्यकर्माशयः।लोभमोहक्रोधप्रभवः।स दृष्टजन्मवेदनीयश्चादृष्टजन्मवेदनीयश्च।तत्रतीव्रसंवेगेन मन्त्रतपः समाधिभिर्निर्वर्तित ईश्वर देवतामहर्षिमहानुभावानामाराधनाद्वा यः परिनिष्पन्नःस सद्यः परिपच्यते पुण्यकर्माशय इति।यथा तीव्रक्लेशेन भीतव्याधितकृपणेषु विश्वासोपगतेषु वामहानुभावेषु वा तपस्विषु कृतः पुनः पुनरपकारः स चापि पापकर्माशयः सद्य एव परिपच्यते।यथानन्दीश्वरः कुमारो मनुष्यपरिणामं हित्वा देवत्वेन परिणतः तथा नहुषोऽपि देवानामिन्द्रः स्वकं परिणामंहित्वा तिर्यक्त्वेन परिणत इति।तत्र नारकाणां नास्ति दृष्टजन्मवेदनीयः कर्माशयः।क्षीणक्लेशानामपिनास्त्यदृष्टजन्मवेदनीयः कर्माशय इति॥१२॥

 The latent deposit of karma of merit and demerit arises due to desire, greed, delusion or anger. And it is felt in the present life or in a future life. Out of these, the latentimpressions of merit gathered by intense practice of samādhi, of austerities and ofsacred prayers, or which is gathered by worship of Īśvara, gods, saintly beings or great men, fructifies at once. Similarly the latent deposit of demerit of the repeatedevil done, due to intense kleśas, towards those who are frightened,sick or miserable,towards those who place confidence in the evil-doer, towards the noble-minded, ortowards those engaged in austerities, fructifies at once.

 Just as, for instance, the boy Nandīśvara passed out of the human form and waschanged into a god; similarly Nahuṣa, the ruler of gods, passed out of his own formand was changed into a lower being (snake).

 Amongst these, the latent deposit of karma felt in this life is not for those whoseaction results in a life in hell. And of those (yogīs) whose kleśas have dwindled, thereis no latent deposit of karma which is to be experienced in a future life.

 Question—

Why should one try to get rid of afflictions?

 The answer (is given in the sūtra)....because kleśamūlaḥ karmāśayo dṛṣṭādṛṣṭa-janmavedanīyaḥ. The word kleśamulaḥ can be analysed as follows—

that latentdeposit of karma (action) which has avidyā, etc.,as the cause for birth (in the world),that is kleśamūlaḥ karmāśayaḥ[^750].

[^750]: "Kleśas are avidyā, etc., already mentioned in YS, II.3. Without the kleśas there will be no actionwhatsoever and without action there will be no birth, etc., in the world. Thus everything is traced to thekleśas— the afflictions."



 From the moment of the fruit of the action coming into effect it lies in the internalorgan (mind), thus it is known as karmāśayaḥ (and) is of a bright and dark nature[^751] bright (white); (2) dark; (3) bright and dark; and (4) neither bright nordark. The last belongs to the yogī but the others belong to all other beings.").dṛṣṭādṛṣstajanmavedanīyaḥ, i.e., that which is seen (i.e., the present life) and that whichis not seen—

[^751]: "Actions are classified as (1

thus there are two kinds of births. The result (karmāśayaḥ) which has tobe experienced in those two kinds of births is dṛṣṭā....karmāśayaḥ. That karmāśayaḥwhich has its result of action necessarily to be experienced in the seen or unseen birth(present life or other than present which is not seen) is that which has the afflictionsas its basis—

this is the meaning of the sūtra.  

 When karmāśaya (deposit of karma) both of a good and bad nature comes intobeing in a particular life (birth), has its result to be experienced in that very life, it iscalled dṛṣṭajanmavedanīyaḥ. And that karmāśaya whose result is to be experiencedin another life (birth) is called adṛṣṭajanmavedanīyaḥ.

 The commentary is now being explained—

tatra....prabhavaḥ[^752]", i.e., he explainsits basis in the afflictions. Thus good deposit of karma arises due to greed as follows: A person thinking, 'I will experience the good result (of my action) either here or inheaven, (engages in) performing sacrifices like 'svargakāma', 'putrakāma',etc[^753].Theexamples for arising out of anger are (illustrated by) the story of Viśvāmitra andAṃbā[^754].The examples for arising out of delusion are (illustrated by) the stories ofDraupadī and Kuṃbhakarṇa[^755].

[^752]: "The reading in the bhāṣya is “kāmalobhamohakrodhabhavaḥ” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has "

[^753]: "In the case of the 'yāga' for a son he thinks he will get the result here and in the case of the 'yāga' forheaven he believes it will be realised there."

[^754]: "Viśvāmitra was annoyed with Vasiṣṭha and Aṃbā with Bhīṣma as is well-known."

[^755]: "Probably a reference to Draupadī's marriage to live brothers; and Kuṃbhakarṇa's request for sleepas a boon."

 Similarly, bad deposit of karma also arises out of greed as follows: One kills atiger for the sake of its skin and one kills an elephant for the sake of its tusks. So alsofor the sake of learning the art of archery, Karṇa ended up telling a lie[^756]." The examplesfor arising out of anger are (illustrated by) the killing of a brāhmaṇa and the killing by Aśvatthāma in the Mahābhārata[^757]. The examples for arising out of delusion are (illustrated by) those who are liberated from worldly bondage and by the story of Nahuṣa[^758].

[^756]: "Karṇa went and lied to Paraśurāma calling himself a brāḥmaṇa in order to learn the science ofarchery."

[^757]: "Aśvatthāmā went on a spree of killing the entire Pāṇḍava clan in a fit of anger."

[^758]: "Nahuṣa was changed into a snake for insulting the sages. Cf. Rukmani, op. cit., vol. II, pp. 42n, 53,53n."

 There is a special relation between greed, anger, and delusion and ignorance andthe sense-of-I.

 Question—

How is that ? One is angry thinking 'I am insulted'. One is greedythinking,‘I will enjoy pleasure'; one is deluded thinking, I am confused'.

 And avidyā (ignorance) which has the nature of confused vision also is connectedwith everything[^759].Without avidyā being present, there is no possibility of the sense-of-I, etc., being present. Attachment is greed itself, and hatred is anger; clinging to life (craving for continued existence ) is included in delusion[^760].

[^759]: "Avidyā being the basis of asmitā, rāga, dveṣa, etc., without avidyā there can be no coming into beingof karmāśaya."

[^760]: "No one can live forever; therefore to so desire is a delusion in itself."

 The statement that avidyā is delusion is made because of the similarity with lackof discrimination[^761];whereas greed, anger and delusion independently, without mutualdependence, give rise to both merit and demerit. Thus he (Patañjali) will say later[^762](that bad thoughts preceded by greed, anger and delusion result in endless pain....)

[^761]: "In both avidyā and moha there is lack of discrimination-so avidyā is also described as moha in a number of places. But the two have to be distinguished when speaking about kleśas. While greed, angerand delusion are the direct causes for afflictions they are rooted in asmitā and avidyā and so altogetherthey lead to karmāśaya and perpetuation of the circle of life and death."

[^762]: "YS, II.34."

 “sa dṛṣṭajanmavedanīyaśca", i.e, that karmāśaya arising out of greed, anger anddelusion are both "dṛṣṭa... nīyaśca"

 Question—

How is it that actions (deeds) which are similar in nature as well ashave the same causes are (divided as) some having their results experienced in the



seen life whereas some have their results experienced in (future) unseen lives.


Answer[^763]:—

[^763]: "The answer is given by Vyāsa and the Vivaraṇakāra just repeats that and explains some of the terms."

"yathā....." and so on. "tīvrasaṃvegena"= by intense effort."mantra.....nirvartitaḥ" = (which is accomplished) through the well-known methodspractised with great intensity. "Īśvara ..... vā" = Īśvara has been mentioned already[^764].The gods (devatā) are Aditya and others; the sages are Bhṛgu and others; the greatbeings (or saintly beings) are those whose minds are always full of knowledge ofdharma;these together or alternatively[^765]—

[^764]: "Cf. YS, I.23 ff."

[^765]: "Devotion either to one of these or to all collectively."

i.e. (the karmāśaya accrued by intense worship of Īśvara, etc.) "sadyaḥ paripacyate" = (yield result) in that life (birth) itself. Thisis like the case of Nandīśvara[^766].

[^766]: "Nandīśvara by intense devotion to Śiva attained divinity in his life itself."

 "tathātīvrakleśena" and so on[^767]. By abundance of greed, etc., (demerit can also beexperienced in one's own life) "bhīta...." = either (towards the frightened, etc.),"tapasviṣu" = or towards those whose minds are always full of knowledge of dharma;(the evil done) repeatedly (towards the above), "sa cāpi... cyate" = yields result (inthe seen life itself). This is like the case of Nahuṣa[^768]."

[^767]: "Demerit can also manifest in one's own life under the circumstances being mentioned."

[^768]: "Nahuṣa who was the king of gods in svarga, threw stones repeatedly at sages carrying Śibi's palanquin. Therefore he lost his divinity and obtained a snake's body in that life itself. The stories of Nandīśvara andNahuṣa are given in the Mahābhārata and the Viṣṇu Purāṇa."

 Even in the world it is well-known that through the special latent potency of theseed and soil, growth of trees and fruits are hastened-this is well-known in the medicalscience dealing with trees. Similarly with reference to action one sees (in the world),the results are sometimes quick and sometimes delayed, as in the case of action likemoving (from one place to another) and cooking; they are characterised by fast andslow practice respectively[^769].'

[^769]: "The analogy is not quite relevant."

 In that connection he mentions as an example of (the quick fruition of) thekarmāśaya of merit (the case of Nandīśvara). "yathā.....pariṇataḥ", i.e., giving up hisown body (human body) (he changed into a divine body) in his own life by the intense practice of the affliction (of devotion) manifested through devotion to Maheśvara.

 “tathā nahusaḥ” = (Similarly Nahuṣa) is an example of (quick fruition of) the



karmāśaya of demerit. "sa devānāmindraḥ[^770]". He (gave up his own body) and throughthe deposit of karma arising out of the intense practice of delusion (was changed intoa lower being).

[^770]: "The reading in the bhāṣya has no "

 As for the examples for anger, etc[^771]., they have already been mentioned in order, asbeing experienced either in this seen life or in a future (unseen) life. By the sameargument it is explained that in those lives wherein the afflictions like greed, etc., arepractised mildly and very mildly the karmāśayas of merit and demerit are to be experienced in unseen (future) lives—this is like what happens in the world. There also itis similar.

[^771]: "Greed and anger and delusion already mentioned with examples, earlier in the Vivaraṇa."

 "tatra nārakāṇām..." and so on. In the case of those who have done deeds whichmerit going to hell like killing a brāhmaṇa,seducing one's own guru's wife, etc.,"nārakāṇām" = for those dwellers of hell according to the rule of quick result of thestate of hell[^772]"teṣām....karmāśayaḥ[^773]" (their deposit of karma) through which theresult is begun (does not fructify in the seen life).

[^772]: "As these deeds are extremely bad their results should come into being in the seen life itself as per theearlier statement. So in this case going to hell does not happen."

[^773]: "Again the Vivaraṇakāra has different readings. He has an additional "

 Question—

How is the karma (deposit of karma) begun in the case of those wholive in hell, in the case of lower creatures and in the case of gods? Only human beingshave the competence to do karma; and this (earth) is the place of action and not placeslike hell, etc.

 Answer—

That is not so; as one sees the action by people like Nahuṣa[^774] acted as mentioned above.").And onehears that even in the case of Indra, by his killing Vṛtra, he attained (demerits) of thekilling of a brāhmaṇa and that he performed yoga and (other spiritual practices asatonement).

[^774]: "Nahuṣa living in svarga and as a devatā, (god

 The saying that only humans have the competence for karma and this earth is theplace of karma (that) is with reference to the quick attainment of the result. Thus it issaid in the Gītā "The result of action is quick in the world of humans[^775]." And byrecalling the mention of an insect by Vyāsa[^776],it is reasonable to believe that lower

[^775]: "Bha. Gītā, IV.12."

[^776]: "In the bhāṣya under II.9."



creatures also have karma.

 Also, it is only in the case of humans having bodies and sense-organs, that karmais proper[^777]. And in the case of deeds (karma) which arise (through the sense-organs)like the mind, mouth, etc., and the body, there is the commencement of result (ofkarma) as they are accompanied by afflictions.

[^777]: "Without the accessories like the body and sense-organs and a deluded identity with them, no actionis possible."

 "kṣīṇakleśānāmapi...śayaḥ", i.e., in the case of those with true insight (yogīs),due to the absence of afflictions (there is no karmāśaya to be experienced in future[^778]).One has not seen the birth of any one who has got rid of attachment. Just as with thecommencement of karma, the afflictions are the cause for the result of karma. Even inthe case of one whose afflictions have been burnt, the karmāśaya which has startedyielding result before the dawn of insight in that seen life fulfils itself, as it hasattained its result, just like a released arrow[^779] alsofulfils its journey, even though the yogī has attained enlightenment.").

[^778]: "This is obvious for the circle is kleśa-karmāśaya-karmaphala-karmāśaya. So if kleśa is gone, therecan be neither fruit nor beginning of karmāśaya."

[^779]: "The seen life in the case of the yogī is the result of the karma which has started giving its fruit whichincluded the present birth, span of life and experiences. Therefore just as an arrow released from the bowcannot go back but has to complete its journey to the target the karmāśaya (called prārabdhakarma

सति मूले तद्विपाको जात्यायुर्भोगाः॥१३॥

 When there is basis (of kleśas) then its (karmāśaya's) results are birth,span of lifeand kind of experience.



सत्सु क्लेशेषु कर्माशयो विपाकारम्भी भवति नोच्छिन्नक्लेशमूलः यथा तुषावनद्धाः शालितण्डुलाअदग्धबीजभावाः प्ररोहसमर्था भवन्ति नापनीततुषा दग्धबीजभावा वा,तथा क्लेशावनद्धः कर्माशयोविपाकप्ररोही भवति,नापनीतक्लेशो न प्रसंख्यानदग्धक्लेशबीजभावो वेति।स च विपाकस्त्रिविधोजातिरायुर्भाग इति।

 When 'kleśas' exist 'karmāśaya' begins to ripen into fruit but not when 'karmāśaya'has its root of 'kleśa' cut off. Just as grains of rice when connected with the husk andwhen its seeds are not burnt are capable of germinating and not that rice from whichthe husk is removed or whose seeds are burnt, so also karmāśaya, connected withkleśas, is capable of giving rise to its fruit and not that (karmāśaya) which is disconnected with kleśas or whose kleśa-seeds are burnt by ‘prasaṅkhyāna'.This fruition isof three kinds — birth, span of life and kind of experience.

 तत्रेदं विचार्यते—

किमेकं कर्मैकस्य जन्मनः कारणमथैकं कर्मानेकं जन्माक्षिपतीति ? द्वितीयाविचारणा किमनेकं कर्मानेकं जन्म निर्वर्तयत्यथानेकं कर्मैकं जन्म निर्वर्तयतीति ?

 In that context (the following points) are to be considered:

 (a) is one action the cause of one birth or does one action bring about many births?  
 (b) do many actions bring about many births or do many actions accomplish onebirth?

 One action cannot be the cause of one birth. Why is that so? Because of theabsence of a rule of succession in the fruition of the present actions and all thoseremaining innumerable actions stored from beginningless time; therefore people willlose confidence (in the performance of actions); this is not desirable.

 Again one action cannot be the cause for many births. Why is that so? When eachaction, amongst so many actions, is the cause for many births then there will be notime for fruition of the remaining actions; this is also not desirable. Nor are manyactions the cause of many births. Why is that so? Because many births cannot takeplace at the same time, they can only take place by turn. Then all the defects mentioned above will arise.



तस्माज्जन्मप्रायणान्तरे कृतः पुण्यापुण्यकर्माशयप्रचयो विचित्रः प्रधानोपसर्जनभावेनावस्थितःप्रायणाभिव्यक्त एकप्रघट्टकेन मरणं प्रसाध्य संमूर्च्छित एकमेव जन्म करोति।तच्च जन्म तेनैव कर्मणालब्धायुष्कं भवति।तस्मिन्नायुषि तेनैव कर्मणा भोगः संपद्यत इति।असौ कर्माशयो जन्मायुर्भोगहेतुत्वात्त्रिविपाकोऽभिधीयत इति।अत एकभविकः कर्माशय उक्त इति।

 Therefore the mixed collection of good and bad latent deposit of karma done inthe interval between one's birth and death, arranged as primary and secondary, manifest themselves at the time of death by coming together in one single impulse; thenbringing about death they result in one single birth. The span of life of that birth is(determined) by that action itself. In that span of life, the kind of experience is determined by that action itself. This 'karmāśaya' is known as 'trivipāka' (having threeresults), because of causing birth, span of life and kind of experience. Therefore, thelatent deposit of karma is known as 'ekabhavika' (the cause of one birth).

****दृष्टजन्मवेदनीयस्त्वेकविपाकारम्भी भोगहेतुत्वाद;द्विविपाकारम्भी वा आयुर्भागहेतुत्वान्नन्दीश्वरवन्नहुषवद्वेति।क्लेशकर्मविपाकानुभवनिर्वर्तिताभिस्तु वासनाभिरनादिकालसंमूर्छितमिदं चित्तंविचित्रीकृतमिव सर्वतो मत्स्यजालं ग्रन्थिभिरिवाततमित्येता अनेकभवपूर्विका वासनाः।यस्त्वयंकर्माशय एष एवैकभविक उक्त इति।ये संस्काराः स्मृतिहेतवस्ता वासनास्ताश्चानादिकालीना इति ।

 In the case of 'karmāśaya' which is experienced in this life, it can either give riseto one result because of being the cause for kind of experience, or it can give rise totwo results by being the cause for kind of experience and for span of life. This isillustrated by the life of Nandīśvara (two results) or of Nahuṣa (one result).

 This mind, permeated from beginningless time, by the subliminal-impressions collected on account of the experiences of the results of ‘karma’ due to ‘kleśas', is coloured, as it were, or is like a fishing net covered all over with knots. Therefore thesubliminal-impressions belong to many previous lives. The particular 'karmāśaya'alone is spoken of as causing one birth. Those latent impressions which are the causefor memory are subliminal-impressions and they are said to exist from beginninglesstime.



 यस्त्वसावेकभविकः कर्माशयः स नियतविपाकश्चानियतविपाकश्च।तत्रादृष्टजन्मवेदनीयस्यनियतविपाकस्यैवायं नियमो न त्वदृष्टजन्मवेदनीयस्यानियतविपाकस्य।कस्मात्?यो ह्यदृष्टजन्मवेदनीयोऽनियतविपाकस्तस्य त्रयी गतिः—

 तत्र कृतस्याविपक्वस्य नाशो यथा शुक्लकर्मादयादिहैव नाशः कृष्णस्य।

 This 'karmāśaya' which is the cause of one birth has its fruition in a limited timeor in an unlimited time. In that context this rule (of one birth) applies only to that(karmāśaya) which is to be felt in a future life and which has definite fruition in thislife, and not to that which has uncertain fruition and is to be felt in a future life. Howis this so?

 That (karmāśaya) which has uncertain fruition in some future life has threecourses—(a) the destruction of the fruit of action done, or (b) merging with an important action, or (c) staying dormant for long, overcome by an important action havingfruition in a limited time. Amongst them the destruction of the unripened action islike the destruction of evil deeds by the performance of good deeds in this life itself.

 यत्रेदमुक्तम्—

 In this connection it is said—

'Two kinds of actions are to be known, one is of anevil kind which is destroyed by the good one; therefore, desire to do good actionshere in the world; thus the wise make known to you the action (to be done)'.

 Regarding the merging into an important action this is said—

'A little mixture (ofbad action) can be removed (by expiation) or can be borne; it is not capable of reducing the (karmāśaya) of good deeds. Why is this so ? Because I have a lot of merit inwhich this (small) evil has been merged; so it will only cause a slight reduction ofmerit in heaven as well.'

 How can (karmāśaya) lie dormant for long, overcome by an important action having fruition in a limited time? Death has been mentioned as manifesting at once the(latent deposit of) actions which are to be experienced in a future life and whosefruition is limited in time; but not of the 'karmāśaya' which is to be experienced infuture and whose fruition is not limited in time.



यत्त्वदृष्टजन्मवेदनीयं कर्मानियतविपाकं तन्नश्येदावापं वा गच्छेदभिभूतं वा चिरमप्युपासीत,यावत्समानं कर्माभिव्यञ्जकं निमित्तमस्य न विपाकाभिमुखं करोतीति।तद्विपाकस्यैवदेशकालनिमित्तानवधारणादियं कर्मगतिश्चित्रा दुर्विज्ञाना चेति।न चोत्सर्गस्यापवादान्निवृत्तिरित्येकभविकः कर्माशयोऽनुज्ञायत इति ॥



 In the case of that action which is to be experienced in a future life and whosefruition is not limited in time, that is either destroyed or it can get merged (into another action) or it lies dormant for a long time over-powered (by an important action)till similar actions which can bring the cause of their manifestation into play,bringabout their fruition. Since the place,time and cause of such manifestation is notdeterminable, the course of karma is mysterious and not discernible.But the generalrule is not destroyed by the exception; therefore, the latent deposit of 'karma' isconsidered to cause one birth.

 Morevoer (when the basis is present the result follows) sati *mūle tadvipāk*o*jātyāyurbhogaḥ*mulam is indeed the afflictions (which is the basis) of karma. *Sati* =when *mūle* = kleśas exist, *tadvipākaḥ*= the fesult is manifested of both good and badkarmāśaya arising out of greed and anger.

 And in answer to the question as to what its result is it is said jāṭyāyurbhogaḥ.

 The commentary “satsu....mūlaḥ” is an explanation of the basis. And as an example for the statement that the result of karmāśaya gets started he (Vyāsa) mentions"yathā... bhāvaḥ".

 Even grains of rice connected with husks are sometimes with their seeds burnt,(then) they are not fit for germination; and even (grains) having their seeds not burnt,when the husks are removed are not fit for germination. In both cases, in order toexplain the illustrated, the example which is an exceptional one, is chosen[^780].

[^780]: "This example fits into the situation and explains both the possibilities."

 तथा “योगैश्वर्यमतिक्रान्तो योगी मुच्येत" इत्यादि।वक्ष्यति चात्रापि प्राप्ताप्राप्तैश्वर्ययोगयोः कैवल्यम् ॥

 Question —

How is that?

 Answer—

"tathā....veti", i.e., karmāśaya connected with kleśas (give rise tokarmāśaya) like rice grains attached to their husks, and like rice grains from whichthe husks are removed (the karmāśaya) disconnected from the afflictions do not give



rise to the result.

 In the case of those yogīs with insight who have got rid of the afflictions by thepractice of the means of yoga,the disconnected afflictions like rice grains with theirhusks removed, having their seed potential burnt, do not give rise to the result; following the path of yoga-practice they have the seed-potential burnt with the fire ofdiscriminate-discernment.

 Thus Vyāsa indicates the concept of liberation between the Sāṃkhya and Yogaschool as different.

 'Just as seeds burnt by fire do not sprout so also the self does not come in contactwith afflictions burnt by knowledge.[^781]"  

[^781]: "The exact quotation is not traced."

 Similarly 'The yogī having gone beyond the powers of yoga is liberated[^782]." He willmention here itself the attainment of kaivalya by the yogī who has attained yogicpowers and the other yogī who has not attained the powers[^783].

[^782]: "Cf. supra, n. 1."

[^783]: "Both attain kaivalya which is in keeping with the yoga philosophy. Cf. YS, III.55 and bhāṣya."

 कतिप्रकारोऽसौ विपाक इत्याह—

 Question — How many kinds are this vipāka (result).

 Answer—

He says "sa...bhoga iti".

 “tatra...te” (This is to be considered). What is the result of the consideration? Hesays—

by each being many actions having opposite results are done in one life itself.Thus 'Man attains the status of immobility (trees, etc.) due to those defects in actionsperformed by the body, through defects (of action) arising from language (he attainsthe status) of birds and animals, (and through defects of actions) arising from themind birth in the lowest castes[^784].'

[^784]: "Cf. supra, nn. 1 & 2."

 (There are other deeds) that bring about the result of reaching svarga (heaven).(And there are ) actions that will result in naraka (hell). It is (also) heard that one deedlike killing a brāhmaṇa leads to many lives. Thus the Smṛti declares 'One who kills abrāhmaṇa is born in the womb of a dog, a pig,an ass, a camel[^785]....’

[^785]: "MS, XII.55."

 तत्र विरुद्धदेशकालनिमित्तविपाकानां कर्मणामेकजन्मारम्भे विरुद्धविपाकतादर्थ्यं हीयेत। ततश्चतादर्थ्यचोदनाः कर्मणां बाध्येरन् \।\।

 अथ पर्यायेण जन्मारम्भित्वं,कर्मणामसंख्येयत्वात् केनचिदेव फलमारब्धं नान्यैरिति,तत्र नियमानुपपत्तिः,केनारब्धः केन वा नेति।तथा च कर्तॄणां कर्मफलं प्रत्य(प्य)विस्रम्भादुत्साहविभङ्गः स्यात् अभ्युदयनिश्रेयसप्रवृत्तिषु ॥



 अथान्यतमेनारम्भे विनाश एवान्येषामिति, तथाऽपि स एव दोषः, किं विनष्टं किमारम्भकमित्यनियमात् ॥

 अथाविनाश एव, तथाप्यवशिष्टस्यारम्भकालाभावो मोक्षाभावश्चेति ॥

 In that context, the actions whose results are caused by deeds done at differentplaces (and) different lives (times) cannot give rise to (just) one life, as having contradictory results it will destroy the significance of results of different (lives). And it willalso affect the deeds which are done for the sake of achieving some particular ends[^786].

[^786]: "If karma is done for attaining svarga, let us say, then if all actions have to fructify in one life alone it will not be possible to accommodate a life in svarga and lives in other wombs in the same life. Thus thecorrespondence between karma and vipāka proclaimed in Pūrvamīmāṃsã will not be realised."

 Question—Then will there be a commencement of lives following one after another; as there are innumerable deeds will only one of those give rise to the result (ofbirth) and not the others ?

 Answer— In that case there will be an absence of any rule as to which one willcommence (the life) and which one will not. Then the doers (of karma) will have noconfidence regarding the result of karma; then there will be loss of enthusiasm forkarma leading to (worldly) prosperity and liberation.

 Question—Then will any one of (the deeds) give rise to one life and all the otherswill be destroyed.

 Answer—Even in that case the defect would be the same as there is no rule as towhich is to begin the life and which is to be lost (as it is not effective).

 Question – Then will there be no loss?

 Answer— In that case the ones which are left over have no time for commencingtheir result and there will be absence of liberation[^787].

[^787]: "As liberation cannot take place without the opportunity for results to come into being."

 तस्मात्प्रवृत्तिनिवृत्तिशास्त्रार्थवत्वप्रतिपादनार्थमिदं विचार्यते ॥

 किमेकं कर्म एकस्य जन्मनः कारणं स्वर्गादिप्राप्तिनिमित्तेषु बहुषु कर्मसु सत्सु।अथैकं कर्मानेकंजन्माक्षिपतीति प्रथमा विचारणा।विरुद्धपक्षद्वयालम्बिनी हि विचारणा एकैव स्यात् ॥

 द्वितीया विचारणा—

किमनेकं कर्मानेकं जन्म निर्वर्तयति विरुद्धफलमविरुद्धफलं वा।अथानेकं कर्मैकजन्म निर्वर्तयति विरुद्धफलमविरुद्धफलं वा ॥

 किञ्चातः ? न तावदेकं कर्मैकस्य जन्मनः कारणम्।कस्मात् ? बहुषु कर्मसु सत्स्वेकमेव कर्म जन्मैकंनारभत इति ॥

 यद्येकस्यैव जन्मारम्भित्वं,तदा अनादिकालप्रचितस्य संसारानादित्वादेकैकेन पुरुषेणासंख्येयमेकैकस्मिन्जन्मनि कर्म प्रचीयते विरुद्धफलमविरुद्धफलं च ॥

 Therefore in order to indicate the meaningfulness of scriptural instructions regarding activity and liberation there is (the following discussion)..."kimekam..." andso on. When there are present many actions which cause the attainment of svarga andso on[^788],(is one action the cause of one birth) or "athaikam...patīti" (does one actionlead to many births)—this is the first point. This discussion of different points ofview, having two sides, is in fact only the same question.

[^788]: "Actions are of many kinds-some done in other worlds, some in this world in many kinds of lives."

 The second consideration is "dvitīya...vartayatīti", i.e., do many (actions) having contradictory results or having non-contradictory (homogeneous) results (bringabout many births) or do the (many actions) having contradictory or non-contradic-



tory results (give rise to one birth).

 So what follows? "na tāvadekam....kāraṇam[^789]". Why is this so? When there aremany deeds one karma alone does not give rise to one birth. If one karma is capableof commencing a birth then "anādi... tasya" = since the world is beginningless everysingle person (puruṣa) accumulates countless karma in each birth, both having contradictory and non-contradictory results.

[^789]: "No new explanation or translation is offered by the Vivaraṇakāra."

 तत्र अवशिष्टस्य जन्मारम्भिकर्मव्यतिरिक्तस्य असङ्ख्येयस्य अनेकजन्मान्तरप्रचितस्य कर्मणः कर्मकलापस्यसाम्प्रतस्य च वर्तमानजन्मप्रचितस्यानारब्धकार्यस्य फलक्रमानियमात् किं पूर्वजन्मोपचितकर्मराशिगतस्यकस्यचिदेव भविष्यज्जन्मारम्भित्वं, आहोस्विदिदानीन्तनजन्मकर्मराशिगतस्य कस्यचिदिति फलक्रमो ननियम्येतेति अनाश्वासो लोकस्य॥

 किं पूर्वजन्मकर्मणा दुष्टेनादुष्टेन वा फलमारब्धव्यम् ? अथेदानीन्तनकर्मणा दुष्टेनादुष्टेन वा ? इत्यविस्रम्भात्न कश्चिदग्निहोत्रादि कुर्वीत।नापि मोक्षाय समीहेतेत्यनाश्वासः प्रसक्तः, स चानिष्टः ॥

 In the context “aviśiṣtasya.....cāniṣṭaḥ[^790]"= all those collections of remaining karmacollected in many lives, apart from the karma which has begun the present life andalso “phala....” (due to the absence of any rule of succession) with reference to thedeeds collected in the present life and of those which have not as yet started theireffects, there will be confusion as follows—

[^790]: "Instead of “saṃpratikasya "

will anyone action belonging to the groupof karma collected in the previous lives give rise to the future life or will anyoneaction belonging to the group of karma of this present life (do that); thus there will be no regulation regarding the sequence of result which will (create a loss of confidencein people).

 Then questions like will the result (commence) be begun through a good or a baddeed (karma) done in a previous life? Or will it be due to a present good or badaction[^791]?Thus losing confidence, no one will perform sacrifices like agnihotra and soon. Nor will there be any desire for liberation due to lack of confidence.

[^791]: "So it is not only doubt regarding the sequence but also regarding whether a good or a bad deed givesrise to the result."

 इदानीं प्रथमविचारणायां द्वितीयं पक्षं निराकरोति—

 Now he refutes the second alternative in the first option[^792]as follows—“nacaikam...", i.e., in each life one does a number of deeds (karma); (then if each gives

[^792]: "That one action can lead to many lives."



rise to many lives) then the remaining karma, apart from the ones which have startedthis life, (will have) the undesirable consequence (of absence of the time of fruition).(That is also not desirable[^793].)And it will have the previous defect of lack of regulationregarding the sequence of result. One cannot accept this kind of undesirable situation.

[^793]: "The Vivaraṇakāra hardly gives his own explanation."

 And in the case of deeds like killing a brāhmaṇa, etc., where each such deed givesrise to many lives, that is the subject of the scriptures and it is to be accepted asbelonging only to the subject of killing a brāhmaṇa, etc[^794].

[^794]: "The scriptures declare that such a single deed will give rise to many lives therefore there is proof ofa single deed giving rise to many lives. But in this case it is an exception and such instances are laid downspecifically in the scriptures and it is not a general rule says the Vivaraṇakāra."

 He now rejects the first alternative of the second option as "na cā....kasmāt", i.e.,that is not logical in the following manner. He thus says "tade....bhavati[^795]", i.e., forone who does not have divine powers (this is not possible). Then (if they have to be insuccession) then the same question will arise as to whether it will give rise to onebirth or many births? "tathā....ṅgaḥ" there will be all the previous defects and because of lack of rule as to the order of the fruition of result there will be lack ofconfidence.

[^795]: "'The word is "

 तस्मात् एवं पक्षत्रयानुपपत्ताविदानीं सिद्धान्तमुपसंहरति—

जन्मप्रायणान्तरे जन्ममरणयोरन्तरे मध्ये कृतःपुण्यपापकर्माशयः अविरुद्धजन्मदेशनिमित्त इति वाक्यशेषः।विरुद्धजन्मदेशनिमित्तः पुनः अदृष्टजन्मवेदनीयःअप्रतिनियतविपाकः।तस्य त्रिधा विनियोगं वक्ष्यति । तस्मादविरुद्धफलस्यैव पुण्यापुण्यकर्माशयस्यायं नियमउच्यते ॥

 (Thus) as all three alternatives are inconclusive he now declares the doctrine of theschool (of Yoga) as "janma..." (Thus) (karmāśaya both good and bad) that is donein between life and death, is the cause of the place and life, which are not incompatible; this must be added in order to complete the sense[^796]. As for that which is the causeof place and life which are incompatible, that is to be experienced in an unseen lifeand its result is not regulated. Its distribution is mentioned as of three kinds[^797]. Therefore only that good and bad collection of karma whose result is not in contradiction(incompatible) to this rule is mentioned.

[^796]: "Only that which can be realised in that life and place and not for instance that to be experienced inhell, etc., this has already been given in YS, II.12."

[^797]: "The vipāka manifests itself in three kinds."


"pracayavicitraḥ[^798]", i.e., as it is collected through many deeds (karma) which areuneven (sometimes similar, sometimes dissimilar) it is varied by its collection."pradhānopasarjanabhāvenāvasthitaḥ" = anyone deed, though dominant in relationto some other deed is (also) subordinate in relation to some other deed and also (in-versely) a subordinate one also becomes a dominant one—

[^798]: "Again the Vivaranakära has different readings. He has an additional "

this is the state of a variednumber of deeds.

 “prāyaṇābhivyaktaḥ”, i.e., just as the contact (coming together) of seed, soil andpotential (to sprout) is the cause for the manifestation of a sprout, similarly death alsois the cause of the manifestation of compatible deeds. “ekapraghaṭṭakena” =by onepush “samuccitaḥ[^799]'' = becoming unified (they give rise to one birth).

[^799]: "In the bh'In the bhāṣya the word is "

 “tacca . . . dyate" (that birth gets its span of life by the deeds) which are manifested by death. (And) that which has determined the (kind of) birth and the span oflife (that same karma determines the kind of experiences in that life). Just as the seedwhich gave rise to the sprout (determines) the flowers, fruits and so on (so is it herealso).


By[^800] these (collected) deeds one understands that there is accomplishment of (thekind of) experiences and the span of life (of that birth). But in the case of otherswhich are causes for span of life, kind of experience, etc., and of sacrifices performedfor the sake of a son or for the sake of cattle, etc., their being causes for the attainmentof a son, span of life and so on, is not rejected[^801].On the other hand, it will go againstthe instruction of all the scriptures and traditional texts[^802].Therefore, “tenaivakarmaṇā..." this removes the doubt that (death) starts the birth (new life) and due toeffecting its task there is an end (to it[^803]).  

[^800]: "The seed in this case being the deeds which have manifested themselves on death as a new birth."

[^801]: "The sacrifices for obtaining a son, etc., can accomplish their results in the seen life also, over and above the ones which are manifested at the time of death."

[^802]: "If the scriptures do not result in what is prescribed in the scriptures it will falsify - them that is not possible according to the believer."

[^803]: "It is not only birth anew but also the span of life and experiences which are determined by it. Therefore this doubt of its restricted role is removed."

 "asau... hetutvāt", i.e., that which has three results like birth, etc., is known as"trivipāka". "ayam... uktaḥ[^804]",' i.e., that which results in one birth is "ekabhavikaḥ".

[^804]: "There is no "

 "dṛṣṭa...bhī" like the performance of sacrifices for fulfilling the desire for obtaining a son or property, etc[^805].").“dvi...hetutvāt” = like sacrifices for long life (spanof life) and fulfilment of desires[^806]."trī...nahuṣavat[^807]".  

[^805]: "grāma stands for collection or village and it is translated as property here. A sacrifice for obtaining ason brings about its results in this life and is experienced in this life (dṛṣṭajanmavedanīya

[^806]: "While in the first it gives rise to one result like getting a son in the second it gives rise to two results."

[^807]: "This whole line "

 Objection—

But then, the mention of the result experienced in this life in the caseof Nandīśvara and Nahuṣa along with the (mention of) three results is contradictory.The seen birth of Nandīśvara is that of a human being. And the divine birth ofNandīśvara or the birth as a python of Nahuṣa are both unseen. In the case of Nandīśvarahis divinity is not fit to be experienced in his human existence nor is the python's lifeexperiences fit to be known in his (Nahuṣa's) divine existence. Therefore how canthere be (in these two cases) the threefold result and the experience in a seen life.

 Answer—

There is no defect here. The body is qualified by the class which isbeing seen; and in their case[^808]it has changed into another class. In the case of others,attaining another birth is due to the efficient cause of impregnation and the materialcause of another birth as qualified by a special class (like the human); but that is notso in the case of Nandīśvara and Nahuṣa. Therefore the commencement of (all) threeresults and its being experienced in a seen life has been illustrated[^809].

[^808]: "Nandīśvara's and Nahuṣa's case."

[^809]: "While this may be technically correct it does not quite answer the doubt raised by the opponent."

 तत्र त्रिविधः कर्मराशिर्दृष्टजन्मवेदनीयश्चादृष्टजन्मवेदनीयश्च।दृष्टजन्मवेदनीयस्त्वनियतविपाकःकदाचिद्भोगहेतुरित्येकविपाकः।कदाचिद्भोगायुर्हेतुत्वात् द्विविपाकः।कदाचित् जात्यायुर्भोगहेतुत्वात् त्रिविपाकोनन्दीश्वरनहुषयोरिव ॥

 अदृष्टजन्मवेदनीयस्तु द्विविधो नियतविपाकश्चानियतविपाकश्च।नियतविपाकस्तु प्रदर्शितःतस्माज्जन्मप्रायणान्तरे कृत इत्यादिना । यस्त्वनियतविपाकः स त्रिविधो वक्ष्यते ॥

 Therefore the threefold collection of karma[^810]are to be experienced in a seen (present)life and in (future) unseen lives. In the case of the (present) seen life the result is notstrictly regulated; sometimes it is the cause of (kind of) experience—

[^810]: "It should be understood as the threefold result of the collection of karma."

then it has oneresult; at other times it is the cause of both experience and span of life then it has tworesults; (and) at other times it is the cause of birth, span of life and experience, then ithas three results as in the case of Nandīśvara and Nāhuṣa[^811].

[^811]: "This is a kind of summary of what has been said earlier by the Vivaraṇakāra."

 As for the result to be experienced in future lives it is of two kinds—

one whoseresult is regulated and the other whose result is unregulated. The case of the regulatedresult has been illustrated by the statement "tasmāj..." and so on[^812]. And the onewhose result is not regulated will be described as of three kinds.

[^812]: "The statement in the bhāṣya which has been explained already."

 And now is explained the other collection of subliminal-impressions which arecaused by the result of karma (through) the words “kleśakarma...bhiḥ”, i.e., thisword is analysed as the experience of afflictions and the experience of karma and theexperience of result—

the subliminal-impressions brought about them[^813]. The mind is(permeated from beginningless time and is coloured as it were) like a cloth, a walland so on. (It is like a fishing net) covered all over (with knots).

[^813]: "By kleśa, karma and vipāka."

 Therefore in each life (birth) "aneka...vāsanāḥ” (many latent impressions) function both in action and result, as important. If any latent impression is not part of theresult of karma (done in the past) then the young male kitten will not exert itself toattack in a sudden fit of anger the young male cat as soon as it is born[^814].And thiscannot take place only because of a latent impression of an experience (occurring) atonce[^815].

[^814]: "The word "

[^815]: "It cannot be explained as if some immediate experience and its latent impression is leading to the behaviour of the little kitten."

 'yastvayam... yaḥ' = this (karmāśaya) in between birth and death, which is thecause of birth and place (of birth) which are compatible, commences the threefoldresult, some being important and others being subsidiary (to the important ones)."eṣa... uktaḥ".(This causes one birth) and not that which is to be experienced in thepresent (seen) life, nor the unregulated result to be experienced in future lives nor thelatent impressions (from beginningless time).

 He describes their nature as follows: "ye saṃskārāḥ...na iti", i.e. because of thebeginningless nature of the world in the form of afflictions, karma, result (fruition ofresults ) and experience.



 "yastva... kaśca"—

He mentions exceptions to one part of what has been saidearlier. How is that so? "sa... vipākaśca[^816]".

[^816]: "While the karmāśaya between birth and death causes the next birth with its threefold fruition hementions that not all of that is experienced in the seen life and thus that is the exception to what wasmentioned earlier. The Vivaraṇakāra does not add any new explanation to this line."

 Question—

What is this which has the fruition regulated (determined)?

 Answer—

That which manifests itself at the time of death commencing its effect.And that alone is the cause of a single birth.

 That, on the other hand, which is the cause of birth and place and time which areincompatible, that is to be experienced in an unseen (future) life; though its experience in a future life is common, its fruition is not determined. Why is that so? As it isin opposition to the determined fruition. And that is also not the cause of a single birthbecause of the opposition (contradiction[^817]).The mention of its being the cause of asingle life (birth) as "yastva....sayaḥ" is because its experience in a future (unseen)life is common.  

[^817]: "If for instance the karmavipāka is to take place in pātāla it cannot fructify on earth as it opposes thecompatibility of place and so on."

 Objection—

But then, in this way the whole process (mentioned by Vyāsa as)"janma....karoti" is contradicted.How so? As death is the manifester of all the earlier karma, and by crushing the basis of karmāśaya other karmāśaya comes into being, and before the basis of the karmāśaya of a human existence (takes effect) there isthe common basis of the karmāśaya of a divine birth (or) the karmāśaya of an animal's birth[^818].And at the time of death which crushes the other (karmāśayas) which isthe cause of manifestation of all karma in general, there is no reason to say that thereis manifestation of only one of the karmāśayas of either divine or animal birth and not of the others. For instance, when a lamp illuminates an object it does not illuminesome suggested portion (by discarding some other portion).

[^818]: "Before the birth as one kind, say for instance a human being, all the karmāśaya having all thesedifferent possibilities are existing."

 Answer—

It is thus said—

that is not correct as there will be the undesirable consequence of futility of karma[^819]. One does many kinds of karma which are mutuallycontradictory (by nature). The one who has done karma for the sake of attainment ofsvarga (heaven) is the same person who after doing karma for the sake of cattle,property, etc., again does extreme karma like killing a brāhmaṇa or that which will

[^819]: "As the whole position will be arbitrary."



lead to an immobile life (as a plant, tree, etc.). In that context for one who reaches hellor an immobile existence (like a tree, etc.) there is no possibility of gaining cattle,property and so on[^820]. Therefore it leads to the futility of such karmāśaya (in thosebirths).  

[^820]: "That makes no sense in that context."

 Question—If it is said that even in such cases there is the pleasure of (possessing)property, etc., then (the answer is) that by just mentioning 'one desires property' thepleasure of (possession of) property is not indicated; it is not as if one possessing thepleasure of property has attained property.

 Moreover all scriptures will be contradicted. And there is only mention of pleasure and pain with reference to the unseen heaven and hell. And such scriptural andtraditional statements as 'tataḥ śeṣeṇa[^821]'which suggest residual presence (of karma)will be contradicted.

[^821]: "Gaut. DS, 11.31. This statement 'From the remainder of the karma' suggests that some karma is leftover."

 Therefore not all karma is manifested at the time of death; (this is so) becauseextremely contradictory karma will result in being futile. And when the scripturesdealing with karma are meaningless then there is the contingency of lack of confidence in the scripture dealing with liberation (mokṣa).

 And there is inconsistency even amongst the ones which are manifested, as onesees that some are manifested while others are not. This is similar to the eye when itreveals form; in the case of the eyes of Caitra and the owl (respectively) there ismutual inconsistency between day and night[^822].When light is common and is in association with all eyes (owl's or Caitra's) it is not associated with the eye of the owl[^823]. (Similarly) in the presence of the same object like a woman, etc., which is the causefor manifestation of all (emotions like) pleasure, pain or delusion only one (emotion)is manifested.

[^822]: "The owl can see well in the night whereas Caitra the human being can only see well during daytime.Therefore the inconsistency."

[^823]: "During day time light does not help the owl to see even though it is equally present for all eyes."

 न च प्रायणमेव कर्मणामभिव्यञ्जकम्।दृष्टजन्मवेदनीयानां भोगार्थानां दर्शनात्।



 Question—If it is said that in that case, due to karma,there is opposition and sothere is no defect[^824]then the (answer is) here also due to opposition there is no manifestation of all karma. Also, in a field when it is shaken (ploughed) and seeds are sownand even when there is the contact with efficient causes like water, etc., there is nosprouting of opposite kinds of seeds to the (ones sown[^825]).Similarly, when the supportfor karmāśaya is the human life, even though there is no opposition (from other kinds)there is manifestation at once of all karmāśayas which are contradictory, like that ofa divine or animal existence.  

[^824]: "Thus though all the emotions must be evoked in the presence of an object like woman, etc., due tcone's own karma only a special emotion is invoked."

[^825]: "The point being made is that only those karma fructify which are not in opposition to the field inwhich they are supposed to fructify. The analogy is somewhat stretched."

 Moreover it is not as if only death is the manifester of karmā (śaya); this is seen inthe planned experiences of the (present) seen life[^826].

[^826]: "People plan, while living, for some specific results and seem to obtain it as well. So death alonecannot manifest all karma."

 किं– कललाद्यवस्थासु मृतानां मोक्षप्रसङ्गः कर्मानारम्भात् ।

 Question—If it is said that let there be only the manifestation of all those (karma)of which death is the manifester; then (the answer is) it is not so; as there is oppositionbetween the karmāśayas of a human existence and that of a divine or animal existence.

 Again death being qualified by different times like past and future it (the onedeath) cannot manifest all karma. Since one hears of different kinds of deaths thereare different (kinds of) deaths. Thus 'Thinking of whatever state (of being) he at theend gives up his body...[^827] he at the end gives up his body, to that being does he attain, O Son of Kunti,(Arjuna), being ever absorbed in the thought thereof.'")' the difference due to thought (mentioned in the Gītā)indicates different kinds of deaths. Thus death does not manifest all karma—in thatcase there will be the futility of the mention of qualification (in the texts like theGītā).

[^827]: "Bha. Gītā, VIII.6. The entire verse translated by Radhakrishnan is as follows- 'Thinking of whatever state (of being

 Nor is there destruction or changing otherwise of what is accomplished because ofthe qualification of thought (at death) as thought has no cooperative role with theaccomplished karma (to start a new life). Thought (memory) is independent; and it(one allows that) there will be no purpose to the karma that has been done (accomplished[^828]).

[^828]: "This appears as a repudiation of the Gītā statement."



 Moreover, in the early stage of the embryo there can be the contingency of liberation, as the karma has not begun to take effect.

 Question—

If it is said that just as it possesses the capacity to fructify it also has thecapacity to give rise to action (then the answer is) it is not so, as there is no assemblage of the instruments (like sense-organs[^829]). It is only when there is an assemblageof the instruments (of action) is there activity and fruition of results of karma. And atthat time that assemblage does not fit in.

[^829]: "Without the instruments of action there can be no action."

 Question— If it is said that it is like dreams, (then the answer is) it is not so. Therealso there is no access to action[^830].And there is the scriptural statement as follows. 'Heis untouched by whatever he sees in that state[^831]'which indicates that whatever rises ina dream is unconnected with karma. No one commits a sin through dream; one seesthe committing of (such sins as) the killing of a brāhmaṇa, etc. (in a dream).

[^830]: "In dreams there is no real action only dream action."

[^831]: "Bṛ. Up., IV.3.15, translation by Mādhavānanda."

 Question— If it is said that one sees expiation for wet dreams, etc., (then the answer is) it is not so; expiation is for the sake of the emission of semen[^832].

[^832]: "Expiation is done for having bad dreams. Hence the question and the answer."

 Therefore,even though like in dreams, etc., the attainment of result in the (early)stage of the embryo fits in, still,due to absence of the co-operation of instruments,that result is also like the state of dream and since there is no action or agency there,liberation is connected only to those who are born from the womb.

 Therefore deaths do not manifest all karma as the distinctions (as past and future)are there. Thus it is said “tatra....niyama”, i.e., that this rule of giving rise to threeresults is only for the state mentioned by the commentary beginning with the words“janma...kṛtaḥ[^833]".(It is not for the other states) “na tu....gatiḥ[^834]”.

[^833]: "As the translation has already been given both in the bhāṣya and earlier in the Vivaraṇa it is not againrepeated."

[^834]: "There is nothing new to the bhāṣya added here."

 How does that happen[^835]?'kṛtasya....nāśaḥ”—

[^835]: "The other karmāśaya having three courses of fruition are now being tackled."

i.e., only that whose time of destruction has come will be destroyed, as for instance when there is destruction of thebad effects of prohibited acts through expiatory deeds. “pradhāna...nam”, i.e., thesubmergence in the important karma whose experience is fixed (determined); without overtaking the result of the main karma it itself, by entering into it, gives rise to itsresult gradually; for instance when all mature grains of rice seeds are ripening thoseimmature grains of rice seeds sown also fructify themselves in a small manner."niyata...nam[^836]", i.e., it rests overcome by or subdued by the main karma of determined fruition whose result has started, due to its result being the cause for incompatible place and time (of birth). As for instance, when two people desiring to conquereach other, one overpowered by the seizure of his kingdom (by the other) stays (over-powered), depending on the time and place.

 "tatra...kṛtasya", i.e., when purity having the nature of austerity, study of scriptures, practice of yoga, etc., and also practice of expiatory deeds comes into being(then) “kṛṣṇasya nāśaḥ" = there is already the (destruction) of impurity of the natureof violence, etc., which had earlier possessed the mind. The words “ihaiva” are notdesirable as that which possessed the mind even in another life can be destroyed.Thus, for instance, the special bad deeds which cause ugly nails, etc., are knownthrough the signs of ugly nails and their destruction is effected by expiatory deeds[^837].

[^837]: "MS, XI.49."

 This is explained through a well-known example mentioned in another branch ofthe scripture (through the words) "dve, dve...vedayante[^838]".In every birth there areboth good and bad (deeds) for an aspirant, competent puruṣa. “eko rāśiḥ" = that

[^838]: "Not traced."



(collection of) good deeds done through study of the scriptures, etc.,(destroys) theother collection got through evildeeds. Or, of the puruṣa (who has done good deeds)(the collection) of good karma (destroys) the collection of bad karma. Therefore (desire) (to do) pure (deeds) to make it good (karma). Why ? Because “ihaiva”= hereitself (in the world itself), "tava karma[^839]" is instructed pleasure, peace, etc., (for you)by those who are knowledgeable about the various results of karma.  

[^839]: "The reading in the bhāṣya is “te karma” and not “tavakarma”. It is interesting to note that the notionsof svarga and pātāla are not taken very seriously and are just metaphors used by wise people."

 He now illustrates, through example, the absorption into a main karma as“svalpasaṅkaraḥ” (and so on), i.e., a meagre mixture of defect, which “saparihāraḥ”has its expiation known, i.e., which is in need of removal but is not as yet removed. Itmeans that it is commonly accompanied by the knowledge of the potency of themeans of expiation. “sapratyavamarṣaḥ"="How did I do bad karma", "When can Iovercome this and not do it again",in this manner it can be taken care of by one whois in difficulty and who is (forced into) bad karma for the sake of protecting one's life.

 “kuśalasya" = for a wise man who knows the various divisions (of knowledge)like deeds, its fruition, its defects, its remedy and so on. “nāyamapakarṣāya[^840]",i.e.,this little pollution (mixture of evil) is not capable of destroying the accomplishmentof the greater result of good deeds, i.e., not capable of destroying and then accomplishing its own purpose. Or (it can mean) that it is not capable of destroying"kuśalasya" = the good deeds. Why is that so? "kuśalam hi me", i.e., the aspirantthinks thus—

[^840]: "The reading in the bhasya is "

As I have (plenty) of good (karma) "bahva...yam" = in that plentifulgood (karma) “ayam"=this little mixture has been “āvāpagataḥ[^841]"(absorbed)“svarge....iti[^842]”.

 Question—

"niyata... nam[^843]". The question "katham" is to indicate a difficult (false)situation. Thus, is it logical for one kingdom which is not active to be over-poweredby a kingdom which is active as there is difference in the efficient causes of operationof kingdoms. Whereas here the efficient cause is death, the manifester equally of allkarma; when that is the efficient cause it is proper that all karma result in activity(and) it is felt that it is not proper that there is overpowering of another (karma) by animportant karma. Therefore let there be just absorption (of one into another[^844]).

It is said "tatrā... kasya[^845]".(It is mentioned that death is the cause ofmanifestation commonly of many karma both good and bad) which are not in contradiction to each other regarding space, time, and general fruition[^846];(and not the ones tobe experienced in the seen life) like those pertaining to sons or property[^847] or"aniyatavipākasya vā"=that which is to be experienced in a future life as it has beenexplained.

[^846]: "Thus it appears that the future life can manifest all those actions which are not incompatible witheach other leaving out those actions specifically done to obtain benefits in this seen life like acquisitionof sons, property, etc."

[^847]: "Nothing new is added to the bhāṣya explanation."

[^848]: "The reading in the bhāṣya is "

 "iyam...ca" (it is varied). "citra[^849]" (it is varied) because of the variety (of states)like destruction, absorption and being overpowered. “durjñānā" (difficult to understand) due to the uncertainty of the place, time and cause of manifestation.

 Objection—

But then, of that (karma) which is to be experienced in a future life(and) which is manifested at the time of death “ekameva janma karoti[^850]"= it is mentioned that it starts one life. Now that is contradicted by the mention of the destruction, absorption and being overpowered (by other karma).

[^850]: "This occurs earlier in the bhāṣya."

 Answer—(The answer then is) it is not so; as the answer has been provided (throughthe words) "adṛṣṭa... niyama iti".


"na...nivṛttiriti[^851]", i.e., (that general rule) (is not overruled by) this (exception) tothe rule. Why is it not overruled?

[^851]: "Again the Vivaraṇa has a different reading from the bhāṣya. Instead of “na cotsargasya"


“eka...iti[^852]”(the karmāśaya causing one birth is difficult to understand) thereforeit is not overruled; i.e., there is no prohibition of its starting a life whose fruition ofresult is not even determined.

[^852]: "Instead of “ekabhavikaḥ karmāśayo'nujñāyata iti' the Vivaraṇa has “ekabhavikaḥ karmāśayo durjñānaiti"

 Or (alternatively), thinking that the general rule is overruled by the exception, thekarmāśaya is difficult to understand (and) does not give rise to one birth; thus it isconnected with the [negation](#).By this, as there is removal of exception of one part ofthe general statement and not of the whole, therefore there is understanding ofkarmāśaya as that which gives rise to one birth with determined fruition of result.

 The other option (is as follows): the subject under discussion is that the operationof karma in this world is to be understood; (and) this is an exception to that, i.e., thekarmāśaya which gives rise to one birth is difficult to comprehend. There the word'iti' is used in the sense of cause. Because of the reason that the knowledge of the general working of karma in this world is not overruled by this exception, thereforeone should comprehend in such manner the operation of karma, as is to be comprehended[^853]. The word "durjñānā" means that which is understood with great difficulty,with great effort.

[^853]: "One exception should not overthrow the general rule seems to be the final conclusion."

**ते ह्लादपरितापफलाः पुण्यापुण्यहेतुत्वात् ॥१४॥**

 They (birth, span of life and kind of experience) have pleasure and pain as resultsdue to virtue and vice.

**** ते जन्मायुर्भागाः पुण्यहेतुकाः सुखफला अपुण्यहेतुका दुःखफला इति।यथा चेदं दुःखंप्रतिकूलात्मकमेवं विषयसुखकालेऽपि दुःखमस्त्येव प्रतिकूलात्मकं योगिनः ॥१४॥



 Those, i.e., birth, span of life and kind of experience give rise to pleasure whencaused by virtue; when caused by vice, they give rise to pain. Just as this pain isundesirable (to human beings) similarly, even at the time of enjoyment of pleasure,there is pain which is undesirable to the yogī.  

 कर्माशय उपव्याख्यातो दृष्टजन्मवेदनीयश्च अदृष्टजन्मवेदनीयश्च।तस्यापि त्रिविधा विपाका जात्यायुर्भोगाःह्लादपरितापफलाः पुण्यापुण्यहेतुत्वात्।ह्लादः सुखं, परितापो दुःखं, ह्लादश्च परितापश्च ह्लादपरितापौ, तौ फलंयेषां ते ह्लादपरितापफलाः।तथा पुण्यं च अपुण्यञ्च पुण्यापुण्ये, ते एव हेतू येषां ते पुण्यापुण्यहेतवः तेषांभावः पुण्यापुण्यहेतुत्वं, तस्मात्पुण्यापुण्यहेतुत्वात्।ते जात्यायुर्भोगाः पुण्यहेतुकाः सुखफलाः।अपुण्यहेतुकादुःखफलाः।यथेदं दुःखं प्रतिकूलात्मकमेवं विषयसुखकालेऽपि दुःखमस्त्येव प्रतिकूलात्मकं योगिनः ॥१४॥

 Karmāśaya has been explained, so also (the karma) to be experienced in the seen(present) life and also that to be experienced in future lives. That also has three kindsof results, i.e., birth, span of life and kind of experiences which are hlādaparitāpaphalāḥ puṇyāpuṇyahetutvāt hlādaḥ = pleasure, paritāpaḥ = pain, and pleasureand pain is hlādaparitāpau.That which has these as the result is hlādaparitāpaphalāḥ.Similarly puṇya and apuṇya give rise to the (dvandva compound) puṇyāpuṇye (virtue and vice). Those which have these (puṇya and apuṇya) as their causes arepuṇyāpuṇyahetavaḥ; and their nature (of being causes gives rise to the word)puṇyāpuṇyahetutvam. Its being a cause results in the word puṇyāpuṇyahetutvāt. “tejātya... yoginaḥ[^854]".

[^854]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not attempt to explain the commentary and leaves it as self-explanatory.Instead of “yathā cedam "

 कथं तदुपपाद्यते—

 How is that possible?

**परिणामतापसंस्कारदुःखैर्गुणवृत्तिविरोधाच्च दुःखमेव सर्वं विवेकिनः ॥१५॥**

 Because of the pains (of causing suffering) in the end, because of anguish, becauseof subliminal-impressions and because of the contrary nature of the guṇas, to thediscriminating, all is pain.

 सर्वस्यायं रागानुविद्धश्चेतनाचेतनसाधनाधीनः सुखानुभव इति तत्रास्ति रागजः कर्माशयः।तथाच द्वेष्टि दुःखसाधनानि मुह्यति चेति द्वेषमोहकृतोऽप्यस्ति कर्माशयः।तथा नानुपहत्य भूतान्युपभोगःसंभवतीति हिंसाकृतोऽप्यस्ति शारीरः कर्माशय इति।विषयसुखं चाविद्येत्युक्तम् ।

 For everyone the experience of pleasure, depending on animate and inanimateobjects, is based on attachment (to those objects); therefore in that pleasure there is‘karmāśaya' born out of attachment. Similarly, men hate objects causing pain and arealso deluded (in the process). Thus there is 'karmāśaya' which arises due to hatredand delusion. This has already been mentioned. Moreover, as enjoyment is not possible without injury to living things there also exists bodily 'karmāśaya' born out ofviolence. The enjoyment of sense objects has been called 'avidyā'.



 या भोगेष्विन्द्रियाणां तृप्तेरुपशान्तिस्तत्सुखम्।या लौल्यादनुपशान्तिस्तद्दुःखम्।न चेन्द्रियाणांभोगाभ्यासेन वैतृष्ण्यं कर्तुं शक्यम्।कस्मात् ? यतो भोगाभ्यासमनु विवर्धन्ते रागाः कौशलानिचेन्द्रियाणामिति।तस्मादनुपायः सुखस्य भोगाभ्यास इति।स खल्वयं वृश्चिकविषभीत इवाशीविषेणदष्टो यः सुखार्थी विषयानुवासितो महति दुःखपङ्के निमग्न इति।एषा परिणामदुःखता नाम प्रतिकूलासुखावस्थायामपि योगिनमेव क्लिश्नाति।

 Because of the gratification of the senses, that calmness (which comes) with reference to their objects is (called) pleasure. That lack of calmness due to greed is pain.Again it is not possible for the senses to be free from greed by repeated enjoyment ofsense pleasures, for repeated enjoyment of sense pleasures increases both attachmentand the skill of the sense-organs. Therefore, repeated enjoyment of sense-pleasures isnot a means to (permanent) pleasure.

 He, who desiring pleasure, gets addicted to the sense-objects is (finally) drownedin the great sea of pain. This is similar to a person who fearing the poison of scorpionsgets bitten by a poisonous snake. This is what is called pain in the end; it is undesirable and even at the time of pleasure troubles only a yogī (and not the ordinary person.)

 अथ का तापदुःखता?सर्वस्य द्वेषानुविद्धश्चेतनाचेतनसाधनाधीनस्तापानुभव इति,तत्रास्ति द्वेषजःकर्माशयः।सुखसाधनानि च प्रार्थयमानः कायेन वाचा मनसा च परिस्पन्दते,ततः परमनुगृह्णणात्यपहन्तिचेति परानुग्रहपीडाभ्यां धर्माधर्मावुपचिनोति।स कर्माशयो लोभान्मोहाच्च भवतीत्येषा तापदुःखतोच्यते ।

 Now what is the pain of anguish? For everyone the experience of anguish, depending on animate and inanimate objects, is based on aversion (to those objects);therefore in that anguish, there is 'karmāśaya' born out of aversion. A person desiringthe means for pleasure works for them through his body, speech and mind. In theprocess he favours (another) or causes pain to another; thus, through favouring (another) or causing pain (to another) he collects 'dharma' and 'adharma'. This kind of'karmāśaya' comes into being because of greed and delusion; there it is called thepain of anguish (anxiety).

 का पुनः संस्कारदुःखता ? सुखानुभवात्सुखसंस्काराशयो दुःखानुभवादपि दुःखसंस्काराशय इति।एवं कर्मभ्यो विपाकेऽनुभूयमाने सुखे दुःखे वा पुनः कर्माशयप्रचय इति।

 एवमिदमनादि दुःखस्रोतो विप्रसृतं योगिनमेव प्रतिकूलात्मकत्वादुद्वेजयति।कस्मात् ?अक्षिपात्रकल्पो हि विद्वानिति।यथोर्णातन्तुरक्षिपात्रे न्यस्तः स्पर्शेन दुःखयति नान्येषु गात्रावयवेषुएवमेतानि दुःखान्यक्षिपात्रकल्पं योगिनमेव क्लिश्नन्ति नेतरं प्रतिपत्तारम्।

 Again what is the pain of subliminal-impressions? Due to the experience of pleasure there is the latent deposit of subliminal-impression of pleasure; similarly, due tothe experience of pain there is the latent deposit of the subliminal-impression of pain.In this way, by experiencing the fruition of deeds either by way of pleasure or painthere is again the collection of latent deposits. Thus the beginningless river of pain,expanding continuously, causes anxiety only to a yogī because it is undesirable. Whyis that so? Because a wise man is like an eyeball. Just as a fine thread of wool fallenin the eye, gives pain by its touch, and not (when it falls) on other parts of the body,



so also these pains trouble only a yogī who is (sensitive) like an eyeball and not anyother person who comes in touch with them.  

 इतरं तु स्वकर्मोपहृतं दुःखमुपात्तमुपात्तं त्यजन्तं,त्यक्तं त्यक्तमुपाददानमनादिवासनाविचित्रयाचित्तवृत्त्या समन्ततोऽनुविद्धमिवाविद्यया हातव्य एवाहंकारममकारानुपातिनं जातं जातंबाह्याध्यात्मिकोभयनिमित्तास्त्रिपर्वाणस्तापा अनुप्लवन्ते।तदेवमनादिना दुःखस्रोतसा व्युह्यमानमात्मानंभूतग्रामं च दृष्ट्वा योगी सर्वदुःखक्षयकारणं सम्यग्दर्शनं शरणं प्रपद्यते इति ।

 As for the others they are pierced as it were, on all sides by 'avidyā' through themodifications of the mind which are variegated due to beginningless subliminal-impressions. They exhaust (through experience) the pain which they have receivedagain and again through their own deeds and they (also) take to pain which they haverepeatedly given up. They follow (believe in) the notions of 'I' and 'mine' which areto be given up and being born again and again are subjected to the three kinds of painproduced by both internal and external causes. Thus, in this way, seeing himself andthe other beings being carried away by the beginningless flow of pain the yogī takesrefuge in true knowledge which is the cause for removal of all pain.

 गुणवृत्तिविरोधाच्च दुःखमेव सर्वं विवेकिनः।प्रख्याप्रवृत्तिस्थितिरूपा बुद्धिगणाः परस्परानुग्रहतन्त्रीभूत्वा शान्तं घोरं मूढं वा प्रत्ययं त्रिगुणमेवारभन्ते।चलं च गुणवृत्तमिति क्षिप्रपरिणामिचित्तमुक्तम्।रूपातिशया वृत्त्यतिशयाश्च परस्परेण विरुध्यन्ते सामान्यानि त्वतिशयैः सह प्रवर्तन्ते।एवमेतेगुणा इतरेतराश्रयेणोपार्जितसुखदुःखमोहप्रत्ययाः सर्वे सर्वरूपा भवन्तीति, गुणप्रधानभावकृतस्त्वेषांविशेष इति।तस्माद् दुःखमेव सर्वंविवेकिन इति ।

 Because of the contrary nature of the guṇas also, (everything is painful) to thewise. The constituents of intelligence which are of the nature of brightness, activityand inertia, depending on each other for mutual benefit, give rise to modificationshaving the three constituents (guṇas) which are either tranquil, cruel or deluded. Themind is said to be changing constantly because the functioning of the guṇas is alwayschanging.

 The intense forms and the intense modifications (of the mind) oppose each other;whereas the ordinary (forms and modifications) function along with the intense. Inthis way, these guṇas by mutual dependence, give rise to ideas of pleasure, pain anddelusion and all (experience) has the nature of all (the guṇas). Their specific nature isdetermined by the preponderance of one or the other guṇa. It is because of this that, tothe wise, all is pain (misery).

 तदस्य महतो दुःखसमुदायस्य प्रभवबीजमविद्या।तस्याश्च सम्यग्दर्शनमभावहेतुः ।

 यथा चिकित्साशास्त्रं चतुर्व्यूहम्—

रोगो रोगहेतुरारोग्यं भैषज्यमिति,एवमिदमपि शास्त्रं चतुर्व्यूहमेव।तद्यथा—

संसार संसारहेतुर्मोक्षो मोक्षोपाय इति।तत्र दुःखबहुलः संसारो हेयः।प्रधानपुरुषयोः संयोगोहेयहेतुः।संयोगस्यात्यन्तिकी निवृत्तिर्हानम्।हानोपायः सम्यग्दर्शनम् ।

 Of this great collection of pain,'avidyā' is the source; and the means for its destruction is right knowledge.Just as the science of medicine has four parts—disease,the cause of disease, absence of disease, remedy—

this science also has four parts.They are as follows—the round of births and deaths (saṃsāra), the cause of saṃsāra,



liberation and the means of liberation. Of these, saṃsāra which is filled with pain is tobe got rid of. The cause for saṃsāra is the association between pradhāna and puruṣa;the total cessation of this association is liberation; the means to liberation is trueinsight (knowledge).  

 तत्र हातुः स्वरूपमुपादेयं वा हेयं वा न भवितुमर्हतीति।हाने त्वस्योच्छेदवादप्रसङ्गः,उपादाने चहेतुवादः,उभयप्रत्याख्याने च शाश्वतवाद इत्येतत्सम्यग्दर्शनम् ॥१५॥

 In this context the real nature of the liberated should not be conceived as either tobe avoided or to be attained; in case of avoidability there will be the contingency ofits destruction and in case it is something to be attained it will mean that it has a cause.When both these views are rejected the doctrine of eternal immutability alone remains. This is right knowledge.

 कथं विषयसुखकाले योगिनः दुःखमस्ति ?।तथा पूर्वत्र चोक्तं दुःखे सुखख्यातिं वक्ष्यतीति।तदुपपाद्यतेप्रतिपाद्यते।तत्र चैतन्न प्रतिपादितम्।दुःखस्य कर्मकार्यत्वात्,कर्मानन्तरं प्रतिपादनं युक्तमिति,बहुवक्तव्यत्वाच्च।परिणामतापसंस्कारदुःखैर्गुणवृत्तिविरोधाच्च दुःखमेव सर्वं विवेकिनः ॥

 "katham" i.e., how is it that when there is pleasure in sense-objects it is pain to theyogīs[^855]? Thus it has already been said that 'he will mention the idea of pleasure inwhat is painful[^856]—“tadupapādyate" = that is being explained. Therein this was notindicated (explained). Pain is effected by action therefore it is proper that it be described after (discussing) karma and also because there is much to be said (in thatconnection[^857]).pariṇāma... vivekinaḥ.  

[^855]: "As mentioned in YS, II. 14 even sensual pleasure is pain to the discriminating yogī."

[^856]: "In bhāṣya under II.5."

[^857]: "These are the reasons for not mentioning these points in II.5 according to the Vivaraṇakāra."

 pariṇāmaḥ = change; tāpaḥ = anguish; saṃskāraḥ = subliminal-impression;tāpasaṃskārau = anguish and saṃskāra; pariṇāmasaṃskārāh = change, anguish andsaṃskāra. They are alone the duḥkha, i.e., the causes of pain; due to these causes ofpain pariṇāmatāpasaṃskāraduḥkhaiḥ sarvameva duḥkham (all is pain). What is thisall? The afflictions are causes because of being the cause for pain. Karma (is thecause) because of its result being pleasure and pain. And birth, span of life and experiences, and also sense objects by being dependent on klesas, are the causes of pain;thus all is pain.

 Question—

Is it the cause of pain for all people?

 Answer—

Not so; so he says... vivekinaḥ. He who has the wisdom (knowledge)regarding the different divisions like kleśa, etc[^858].,he is known as the wise man. In thecase of one who knows (the nature of) kleśa, karma and vipāka, (and) (who knowsthe nature of the) subliminal-impressions, change and anguish which are of theessence of the contrary nature of the guṇas as being the causes of bringing all pain(one who knows thus has no pain); this is what it means and not of any other whodoes not have the wisdom to know in this manner[^859].

[^858]: "kleśa, karma and vipāka."

[^859]: "All others will have pain from all these sources but not the wise."

 In his case there is pain only of (the nature of) anguish. That also is shown in aninternal way like 'I am suffering[^860]';there also, having this doubt this (wise) man discriminates even (between the pain and himself) as "This pain is mine[^861]".If even thisdistinction is realised (known), then even the means to pain can be thought about as"This is the (means) to pain'. Thus he also will start enduring it (thinking) 'All this ispain' and he also will be a wise man. Therefore, even if at the time of suffering theunwise experience only the pain, still they do not consider the means (to pain), etc., as'all this is pain[^862]'." But in the case of one who sees the cause of pain of changes, etc., tothat wise man all is pain.

[^860]: "This is a peculiar formation and difficult to associate with Śankara, the author of the BSBh."

[^861]: "There is no identification of oneself with the pain but there is constant awareness of its distinctionfrom oneself."

[^862]: "The Vivaraṇakāra would like to class those as also wise who distinguish between pain and oneself.The yogīs are a class by themselves but these can also be called wise men."

 तत्र तावत्परिणामदुःखतां व्याचष्टे—

सर्वस्यायं रागानुविद्धः।सर्वस्येत्यनेन सर्वप्राणिप्रसिद्धत्वादव्यभिचारिप्रत्यक्षावगम्यत्वं दर्शयति।चेतनाचेतनाधीनः पुत्रपशुहिरण्यादिसाधनायत्तः सुखानुभव इति ।सुखानुभवकाले रागो मनोव्यापारः तद्विशिष्टो हि सुखमनुभवति।स सर्वो व्यापारः क्लेशोपसंहितत्वाद्धर्माधर्महेतुः।तत्पूर्वश्च कर्माशयः प्रारब्धफल उपभुज्यते,भोगकाले चापर उपचीयते।ततश्च क्लेशमूलः कर्माशयः सति मूलेतद्विपाक इत्युपपन्नं भवति ॥

 In that context he explains the nature of pain of changes (in the following words)"sarvasyā..." and so on. By the word "sarvasya" it is indicated that this is well-known in the case of all living creatures and it is capable of being directly perceivedwithout fail in all instances. "cetanā.....naḥ[^863]" = (The experience of pleasure) isobtained by (various means like) sons, cattle, gold, etc. At the time of experience ofpleasure the mental activity is (characterised by) attachment; one experiences pleasure through that (the mind) qualified (by attachment). All activity being subsumedunder afflictions are the causes of dharma and adharma. The karmāśaya earlier to that which has started yielding its result is being experienced; at the time of experience

[^863]: "The bhāṣya has "



other (karma) is being collected. Thus (the statements) (karmāśaya has kleśa as itsbasis[^864]) and (when there is a basis then its result comes into being) are quite consistent[^865].

[^864]: "YS, II. 12."

[^865]: "YS, II.13."

 तथा,सुखवेलायां सुखप्रत्यनीकभूतानि दुःखसाधनानि उपलभमानो द्वेष्टि,तथा सुखोपभोगपरिपालनव्यग्रतरमानसो मुह्यति चेति द्वेषमोहपूर्वव्यापारजनितोऽप्यस्ति कर्माशयः।अथवा द्वेषमोहावेव व्यापाररूपावितितत्कृत एव॥

 Similarly, at the time (of experience) of pleasure having come into contact with“duḥkhasādhanāni” = (the causes for pain) which are the opponents of pleasure “dveṣṭi”(he hates that which causes pain). Similarly with his mind fully occupied in the preservation of (the means of) experience (enjoyment) of pleasure “muhyati....karmāśayaḥ[^866]''(there is karmāśaya) caused by activity arising from (hatred and delusion). Or (one can interpret it as) hatred and delusion are the form of mental activities;therefore (the karmāśaya) is created by them[^867].

[^866]: "The Vivaraṇakāra leaves out the word "

[^867]: "In the second interpretation, preservation of pleasure is not the cause of hatred and delusion butmental activities of this nature."

 Similarly, this (experience of) pleasure "nānupahatya..." (does not take place)without injury (to living beings). Experience itself is the cause of injury; so it isspoken of as being the destroyer—

having similar agency. Another person also thinks'He is enjoying what belongs to me'; there also the thought is that wealth is fit to beenjoyed by all; therefore, when one acquires it, there is certainly hurt to another; or(to word it differently) whatever is acquired is only after causing injury (to someoneor other). Therefore “hiṃsā.....śarīraḥ[^868](there is bodily karmāśayaḥ born of violence); this is because the activity for acquiring it (experience) is effected through the body.

[^868]: "The Vivaraṛakāra has “karmāśayaḥ sārīraḥ” whereas the order in the bhāṣya is “Śārīraḥ karmāśayaḥ”."

 In this manner at the time of enjoyment, a person accumulates karmāśaya causedby greed,anger (and) delusion.Thus being qualified by attachment, hatred and



delusion the experience (enjoyment) of pleasure is characterised by different kinds ofkarmāśaya; while undergoing changes this becomes painful in intervals, (and) so it iscalled pain due to changes. As for the wise who see this as it (truly) is there is paineven at the time of enjoying (experiencing) pleasure; this is like a person eating curdrice knowing that it is poisoned[^869].

[^869]: "This analogy does not ring true-if one knows the curd rice is poisoned surely he won't eat it. Itcould mean that it will lead to ill health and thus is poisoned."

 From this (it follows that) all is pain, since all sense pleasures are due to ignorance.The experience of sense pleasures has the nature of lack of discriminate thought.Thus he (Vyāsa) mentions "viṣaya... ktam".

 Question— Where is this said.

 Answer—

Here (in the bhāṣya itself) by using similar words (as follows) “atyanta...bhoga iti[^870]".

[^870]: "Bhāṣya under YS, II.6. As it has been already translated there it is not being repeated."

 यद्वा,सूत्रकारेणोक्तमुपरिष्टात् “प्रत्ययाविशेषो भोगः” इति।अविद्या च परिणममाना सर्वमनर्थं करोति।ततश्च दुःखबीजत्वादुःखमेव विषयसुखम् । यथा व्याधिनिमित्तत्वात् स्वादुतरमपि भक्ष्यमाणम्॥

 या तु लौल्यादीप्सया तृष्णातः सकाशादनुपशान्तिः अनुपरतिः तद्दुःखम्।तदुक्तम्—

“नास्ति तृष्णासमं दुःखं नास्त्यतृष्णासमं सुखम्” इति ॥

 Or, the Sūtrakāra (Patañjali) mentions later on pratyayaviśeṣo bhogaḥ[^871]. Ignorancewhich is constantly in a state of flux (changing) makes everything futile.Thence(from avidyā) as it is the seed of pain, sense pleasure is only pain; as for instance theconsuming of something which is known to be the cause of illness even if it is verytasty. In order to throw more light on the same idea that sense pleasure is ignorance,he points out the well-known example in the system (through the words) “yā..." andso on, i.e., those which are experienced are experiences like sound, etc. When they(the sense experiences) are the causes (there is satisfaction) and the "upaśāntiḥ” repose to the sense-organs (from that satisfaction) is (pleasure which is) a state of lackof worry due to any activity that can cause any calamity.

[^871]: "YS, III.35. Experience is a feeling of identity between the sattva-intellect and the puruṣa."

 “yā tu[^872].."(when) due to great desire or because of greed there is “anupaśāntiḥ”—lack of repose (calmness) "tad duḥkham" (that is pain).Thus it is said “There is nopain like greed and no pleasure like lack of greed[^873].'

[^872]: "There is no “tu"

[^873]: "MBH, XIII.15.3997."

 Objection — But then, it is only by enjoyment (of sense pleasure ) will there bedisenchantment (towards them) at the end of enjoyment (experience); and enjoymentitself is pleasure.

 Answer—

Therein he says "na cendriyāṇām... kartum[^874]". "kasmāt" (Why is it so?).In answer he says "yato ...rāgaḥ[^875]". Thus it is said 'Desire is never quenched by theenjoyment of pleasurable sense objects; on the other hand like sacrificial offeringcreating a smoky trail, it only increases it (the desire[^876]).'

[^874]: "Instead of “vaitṛṣṇyam kartum śakyam"

[^875]: "Here also the Vivaraṇakāra has a different order of the text."

[^876]: "MS, II.94; Vis. P., 4.10.23."

 "kauśalāni", i.e., the skill of the sense-organs in both enjoyment (of new) as wellas in repeated enjoyment (of old sense pleasures) increases. Though the skill of themind precedes the skill of the sense-organs still, one observes the skill of the sense-organs in the art of begging[^877]."tasmādanu.... iti"; therefore, pleasure is only withdrawing from repeated enjoyment of sense pleasures. "Sa khalvayam.... sitaḥ". (He is) bound (by sense pleasures) or engaged (in them) or thinking about them constantly; just as fearing a minor calamity arising from the minor poison of a scorpionone is caught in (bitten by) the more virulent poison of a snake he (the one attached tothe senses) ends up in greater pain (at the end).

[^877]: "This obviously was a social evil by the time of the Vivaraṇakāra. Was it so pronounced duringSankara's time?"

 Thus this man has turned away (because of attachment to sense pleasures) fromthat which at the beginning appears as pain and ends as great pleasure, being afraid offelt pain; “mahati....yoginaḥ[^878]"= he is drowned in the deep (sea of pain); and theyogī, with a mind shaken as it were, experiences pleasure, because that karma whichis to be experienced compulsorily is indeed powerful. Therefore to a yogī all is painful (everything is pain[^879]).

[^878]: "The Vivaraṇakāra leaves out “ni” in “nimagnah”."

[^879]: "The yogī has experience of pleasure and pain but he does not go searching for them but karma to beexperienced makes him undergo them. But he is fully aware of its painful nature-not so the worldlyperson."

 अथ तापदुःखता व्याख्यायते—

सुखोपभोगस्तु परिणममानः सन्ननुबन्धे विज्ञाने विषदिग्धस्वादु्दध्योदनोपभोगवद्दुःखीभवति, स्वरूपतः पुनरविद्यारूपोऽनुकूलवेदनागन्धोऽपि।इह पुनः स्वरूपत एव दुःखतातापस्य प्रतिकूलात्मकत्वात् ॥



 कथम् ? सर्वस्य द्वेषानुविद्धः द्वेषानुगतः चेतनाचेतनसाधनाधीनः शत्रुकण्टकादिसाधनायत्तः तापानुभवःपूर्ववदेवाधर्मफलमनु भवति अपूर्वश्चोपचीयमानः तत्रास्ति द्वेषजः कर्माशयः॥

 तेन च दुःखेन परितप्यमानः सुखसाधनानि चन्दनादीनि प्रार्थयमानः कायेन वाचा मनसा च परिस्पन्दतेचेष्टते।तच्च परिस्पन्दनं परानुग्रहाय परपीडनाय वा भवति।ततः परानुग्रहपीडाभ्यां धर्माधर्मावुपचिनोति।सच परानुग्रहपीडाकृतो धर्माधर्माख्यः कर्माशयो लोभान्मोहाच्च प्रभवतीत्येषा तावत् तापदुःखता द्राघीयसीविप्रसृता । एवं पश्यतो विवेकिनः सर्वमेवाश्रयविषयनिमित्तैर्दुःखमिति॥

 He now explains pain due to anguish as follows:

 The enjoyment of pleasure while changing (and) when in the interval (its truenature) is known, causes pain like the enjoyment of tasty poisoned curd rice; as amatter of fact again, even what has a tinge of favourable experience is of the nature ofignorance. In this context however, even by its very nature anguish (anxiety) is painful as it has an unfavourable nature.

 Why is this so? "sarvasya" and so on."dveṣānuviddhaḥ"=accompanied byhatred. “cetanācetanasādhanādhānaḥ"=dependent on (various) means like enemies,thorns, etc., (the experience of anxiety) is like what was (said) earlier (in connectionwith pariṇāma) followed by the result of adharma; and in the process of accumulatingdharma and adharma (there is karmāśaya born out of hatred).

 Experiencing anguish due to that pain "sukhasādhanāni" = he exerts (through body,speech and mind desiring) sandalwood paste, etc., (which are objects of pleasure).This exertion can result either in helping another or in harming another. As a result(he collects dharma and adharma through helping or hurting others). “sa ca karmāśaya[^804]''(and that karmāśaya) known as dharma and adharma, caused by helping or hurtingothers, (comes into being because of greed and delusion); thus (this pain of anguish)is long and wide. To that wise (discriminating) man who sees (knows) this as of thiskind, all is pain due to (dependence on) support, sense objects and causes.

[^804]: "There is no "

 अधुना ह्लादपरितापानुभवजनितसंस्कारदुःखमुच्यते—का पुनः संस्कारदुःखता?सुखानुभवात्सुखसंस्काराशयः, दुःखानुभवादपि दुःखसंस्काराशयः।सुखदुःखयो रागद्वेषानुविद्धत्वात्तत्संस्काराशयावपिरागद्वेषानुविद्धौ।एवं कर्मणो विपाके जात्यायुर्भोगाख्येऽनुभूयमाने सुखदुःखे भवतः॥

 ततोऽपि सुखदुःखानुभवसंस्काराशयः यथा नैरन्तर्येण सुखदुःखानुभवस्तथैव तदनुभवसंस्कारावपिरागद्वेषानुविद्धौ निरन्तरतया भवतः।तौ च संस्काराशयौ क्रियाया उपभोगस्य चाङ्गीभवतः।एवं संस्काराशयस्यदुःखहेतुत्वम्।संस्कारहेतुकं संस्कारदुःखं,तथा च तत्संस्कारदुःखता।न ह्यस्मरन्नुपभोगाय क्रियायै वासाधनमुपादत्ते।स्मृतेश्च संस्कारनिमित्तत्वमुपपादितम्॥

 यद्यपि संस्कारस्य स्वरूपतो दुःखता नास्ति,तथापि संस्कारस्य दुःखहेतुतां जानतो विवेकिनः सत्तामात्रेणदुःखत्वं, भक्षितमात्रविषवत् इत्थमेतैः परिणामतापसंस्कारहेतुभिः सर्वमेव दुःखमित्यनादिदुःखस्रोतो योगिनमेवप्रतिकूलात्मकत्वादुद्वेजयति॥

 Now he mentions the pain due to subliminal-impressions created by the experience of pleasure and (anguish) (through the words) “kā...tā”. “sukhā...śayaḥ".As pleasure and pain are coloured by attachment and hatred their respective karmāśayaimpressions (collection of karma saṃskāras) will (also) be coloured by attachment



and hatred. "evam ...duḥkhe[^843]",i.e., (in this manner) (in the experience of karma)known as birth, life-span and experience there are (pleasure and pain).

[^843]: "Instead of "

 And thus there is the collection of latent deposits of experiences of pleasure andpain; just as there is continuous experience of pleasure and pain, in a similar way thelatent impressions of their experiences coloured by attachment and hatred is alsotaking place continuously. And those latent impressions and deposits (collections)are important as far as the experiences of actions are concerned. In this way, thedeposit of latent impressions is the cause of pain. The pain of latent impressions hassamskāra (latent impressions) as the cause and thus the pain due to latent impressions. One does not take up the means (to achieve) enjoyment (experience) or (any)action without remembrance. Thus it is established that memory also has latent impressions as its cause.  

 Though latent impressions do not have pain by their very nature (per se) still, tothe discriminating person (wise man) who understands the causal nature of the latentimpressions with regard to pain, the very fact of existence has pain, just like poisonon consuming it[^882]. Therefore, in this manner, due to the causes of change, anxiety andlatent impressions all is pain—

[^882]: "Just coming into being is pain and it is compared to consuming poison."

"anādi... yati[^883]".

[^883]: "Nothing new is added to the bhāṣya here."

 ननु चेतरस्यापि प्रतिकूलात्मकमेव,कस्मान्न तमुद्वेजयति।नात्यन्तक्लेशादिकालुष्याविवेककिणीकृतचेतस्त्वादितरमुद्वेजयति।न प्रतिकूलात्मकता प्रभाव्यते।यो हि दयितामुष्टिघातं मुद्गराभिघातदेशीयमपिमस्तकेन प्रतीच्छति।पुत्रस्य वा मूत्रपुरीषमुरसा धारयति।असावानन्दमहोदन्वत्तरङ्गायमाणः\[णं\]स्वात्मन्यपिन वातितराम् \[स्वात्मानमपि न वेत्ति तराम्\]।न हि तस्य तत्प्रतिकूलात्मकम्।रागमेव हि तदितरस्यप्रतिपत्तृत्वादभिवर्धयति तराम् ॥

 Objection—

But then, it has undesirable consequences (unfavourable) for anotheras well; so why does it not cause anxiety to him?

 Answer—

It does not cause anxiety to another[^884] because his mind has been calloused (reduced to nothing) due to indiscrimination caused by the (extreme) impurityof the afflictions; therefore the nature of its being unfavourable does not becomepowerful (to influence the mind). One who is overcome by the force of a loved onewelcomes with head bowed down (wholeheartedly) even that which is like the blowof a hammer.He will carry on his chest the urine and faeces of his son. Swimming inthe great flow of the waves of happiness he does not consider himself any better(capable of crossing over[^885]). For him (all this) has no adverse nature. Attachment isalone accepted by the other, so his crossing over (to attachment) is increased.  

[^884]: "Other than a yogī or wise one."

[^885]: "The construction is not very clear."

 Objection — But then, even the yogī has the same cause available (to him). So inwhat way does it cause anguish to him[^886].'

[^886]: "Rāga is common to both so how does it affect these two differently."

 Answer — It definitely causes anguish (anxiety) to him.

Question —"kasmāt"? "akṣi...saḥ[^887]"(This is so) because he has clarity of vision,he is detached. Therefore the cause is not the same for him and that is why he is onewho knows (a wise man). In the case of a wise man his mind has not been calloused(reduced to nothing) due to indiscrimination caused by the (extreme) impurity of theafflictions. And there is no wisdom without repudiation of the hardened mind. Therefore, because he is like the eyeball, it causes anxiety only to a wise man and not toanother.

[^887]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has instead of “akṣipātrakalpam...vidvān"

 Therein, through the two examples he points out the difference between a wiseman and a foolish one (through the words) "yathorṇa... yati" = even a very fine(thread of wool in the eye hurts by its touch) because the eye is very pure; similarlypain causes anguish to a yogī whose insight is very discriminating and whose mind iswithout impurity. That same thread of wool when fallen on other parts of the bodydoes not hurt even when touched by a very hard subtance. Similarly “netaram... ti”pain does not cause hurt (to another who comes in contact with it) because his mindis hardened by afflictions, etc., and he is like the other parts of the body which aregrosser (not pure).

 He thus says "evam...ram[^888]".In the case of the other (non-yogī) experiencer hepoints out his similarity to the other parts of the body (through the words) “itaram tu”.The sentence ends with the words "tāpā anuplavate".

[^888]: "There is nothing new added by the Vivaraṇakāra; so it can be seen under the bhāṣya."

 “svakāraṇopahṛtam[^889]"= that which is brought into being through the causes bothanimate and inanimate producing pain and reaching a state of action of puruṣa through

[^889]: "The bhāṣya has “svakarmopahṛtam"





the modification of the mind; "duḥkham....iva" = at the giving up of the body (atdeath) (on the one hand) and on the other hand (that which has been given up) isagain another of the nature of the body; "duḥkha ...miva[^890]" (they take on repeatedly)the recollection (of pain) (and are pierced as it were on all sides) by ignorance[^891].

[^890]: "samudāya"

[^891]: "Thus ignorance is beginningless and is seen manifested through the modifications of the mind."

 Question—

In what way is the other (non-yogi) different?

 Answer—

"hātavyā....nam[^892]".The sense-of-I is the feeling of gain, due to ignorance, in causes and effects along with their properties such as action, quality andresults. The idea of mine on the other hand is the idea of possession in all thoseoutside objects both animate and inanimate. Those two, because of ignorance andbecause of being the seed of (future) results, action and afflictions, are to be destroyed. They cannot gain strength (grow) without the aid of (kleśas like) attachment,etc., nor without karma and vipāka-therefore they are to be destroyed. That whichhas the nature of following those two (ahaṃkāra and mamakāra) is that which follows the sense-of-I and the sense of possession. The accusative (tam) of that gives theform ("hātav. . . nam").  

[^892]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has "

 "jātam-jātam", i.e., like the other parts of the body[^893](it is born again and again);“bāhyā....nimittāḥ”, i.e. (bāhya stands for external causes like) the ones that aredivine and the elements, ādhyātmika stands for the internal causes and effects pertaining to oneself; thus the word meaning 'produced both by internal and externalcauses' is a compound formed as follows—

[^893]: "Perhaps hair and nails may be indicated here."

those which have both external and internal causes.

 "triparvāṇaḥ" = the threefold nature is due to external causes, etc. Or the three-fold nature can be the past, future and present nature. He (Patañjali) will say laterheyam....gatam. (The pain to come is to beavoided[^894]).Or (the threefold nature) canbe having afflictions, karma deposit and fruition of karma. Or, yet again, it can be thethreefold pain caused by changes, anguish and latent-impressions. Therefore (thatthreefold pain) "anuplavante" = gets attached (in this way).

[^894]: "YS, II. 16."

 "tadevam[^895]" = (in this way) being subject to indiscrimination, "anādi... dyata iti"=(seeing himself and other human beings) drowned in the sea of pain (the yogi takesrefuge in true knowledge[^896]).'

[^895]: "There is the alternative reading here as "

 इतश्च सर्वं दुःखं विवेकिनः।कुतश्च ? गुणवृत्तिविरोधाच्चापि ।  

 Objection—But then, discriminate-insight is achieved only by being a yogī (having the prowess of a yogī).

 Answer—One acquires the prowess of a yogi just by the practice of the means toyoga, even without discriminate-discernment[^897]. Therefore he points out that the practice of yoga is the means to achieving discriminate-discernment. Seeing (realising)that yoga, the result of yoga and everything is just pain he resorts to insight as theonly refuge. Thus he (Patañjali) will say later *tadvai... kaivalyam[^898].*

[^897]: "Practice of the means will also achieve the same result."

[^898]: "YS, III.50. Patañjali will mention that one has to renounce even the state of discriminate-discernment in order to achieve kaivalya. The Vivaraṇakāra points to this sūtra for support for insight whereasPatañjali is talking of a stage which is beyond insight."

 Because of this "sarvam... vivekinaḥ[^899]"(all is pain for the wise). Why is it so?"guṇa.......ccāpi[^900]"

 Objection—But then, why is there a different case ending in the sūtra (for thesetwo phrases), when it should have been just parināma ... virodhaiḥ[^901]'.

[^901]: "The first one pariṇāma... khaiḥ being in instrumental plural and the second guṇa... dhācca being in ablative singular."

 Answer—There is no defect in that. The experience of pleasure and pain and theirlatent impressions are well-known to all people, therefore it has been indicated throughthe instrumental plural as *pariṇāma...duḥkhaiḥ*. The contradictory nature of theguṇas are only known to those of great wisdom who have the clarity of knowledge ofthe (various) divisions of those causes—therefore it has been mentioned as a separatecause. (And) since being the cause for all pain is common (to both) they are includedin one sūtra.



 The guṇas are sattva, etc., their modifications are the modifications (nature) of theguṇas; 'because of their (mutual) contradiction' gives rise to the word gunavṛtti-virodhāt. These guṇas are present in the form of mental processes; and as these havea single mutation in line with the important guṇa (of the moment) they are by naturecontradictory. As one modification arises it is overcome by another modification.[^902]

 In this manner,amongst the three (guṇas) there is mutual repudiation of theirmodification at every moment on the one hand and on the other hand a manifestationof modification by mutual (interaction). The coming into being of one modificationof the guṇas of the nature of pleasure, pain and delusion is not the non-manifestationsimultaneously of other (modifications). Therefore it establishes the following—

[^902]: "As the three guṇas have contradictory natures the resultant process is arrived at by the important guṇa overcoming the opposition of the other two guṇas."

whenthe quality of rajas of the nature of pain manifests itself then it can be said that itsbeing of the nature of pain its modification has no pain[^903]. The qualities of sattva and tamas also have the quality of rajas accompanying them; therefore they also are of thenature of pain[^904] and delusion(tamas), everything is painful in the end.").The activity (predominance of) and lack of activity (subsidiary nature) of sattva and tamas are accompanied by the operation of the quality of rajas;therefore all is pain.

[^903]: "In other words it can be argued that rajas alone gives rise to pain and not the modification of the mind involving other guṇas as well. But that is not so."

[^904]: "It is always a combination of the three that one has in the system; so every guṇa is accompanied byevery other guṇa. So rajas being present everywhere even in states of tranquillity (sattva

 He explains it (through the following words)—

"prakhyā...bhante[^843]",i.e., thoughmutually they are of contrary natures, by alternatively helping each other and beinghelped by each other they give rise to thoughts (modifications) (having the threequalities) of "śāntam" = sattva, "ghoram" = rajas and "mūḍham" = tamas like a lamphaving a flame, oil and wick. Accompanied as a subsidiary by the other two, when asāttvika, tranquil thought has arisen almost immediately afterwards it is destroyed bya tāmasika thought desiring to manifest itself accompanied by the rājasika, passionate (fearful) thought.

[^843]: "Instead of "

 And when a fearful (passionate) rājasika thought accompanied by the other (twoas subsidiary) has arisen then almost immediately afterwards it is destroyed by adeluded tāmasika thought desiring to manifest itself accompanied by a sāttvika(thought) or by a sāttvika thought accompanied by a tāmasika (thought). In a similar



way, a tāmasika (thought gets destroyed) in turn by the other thoughts; similarly theothers (are destroyed) by a sāttvika (thought); thus the guṇas function arising anddestroying one another.

 Question—Why is this so? Answer—Because "calam guṇavṛttam", i.e., the nature of the guṇas is such that the guṇas take shape in keeping with the character of themind and so "kṣipra...ktam[^906]" (the mind is said to be changing constantly).

[^906]: "The reading in the bhāṣya is “kṣiprapariṇāmi"

 Question — Where is this mentioned?

 Answer—In the system (of yoga).

 Question—Why do the guṇas oppose each other?

 Answer—(This is so) because many predominant (guṇas) cannot exist simultaneously. Just as in an enclosure (enclosed space) having both light and darkness predominantly[^907],
so also the gunas modified in accordance to illumination, activity (etc.)which take on the forms of the mind in the shape of pleasure, pain or delusion cannothave simultaneously a predominance characterised by either a form, or a modifiedstate like pleasure, etc., or a state characterised by knowledge.

[^907]: "Whichever is predominant that will characterise the room. We therefore say it is bright here or darkhere in the room."

 Whereas the ordinary (undeveloped states) not being in opposition,it is properthat their unmanifest (undeveloped) modifications exist along with the manifested,predominant modification (of the mind). Thus it is said “rūpātiśaya...nte[^908]".Whenthere is predominance of the state of pleasure then there is no developed state of painor the developed state of delusion.Similarly in the developed state of either of theother two there is no predominant state of the other two.Thus when the modificationin the form of knowledge is intense the modification in the form of greed is notintense; similarly in the developed state of either of the other two modifications thereis no predominance of the modification of the other  two[^909].

[^908]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not have “paraspareṇa” and instead of “pravartante"

[^909]: "The same idea is repeated again and again in different forms. Only one guṇa in its manifest form isseen while the other two are present in an unmanifest from."

 “evamete...yāḥ[^910]”,i.e., the idea of pleasure is the resultant idea obtained throughsattva depending on both rajas and tamas. Šo also the idea of pain is the resultant ideaobtained through rajas depending on both sattva and tamas. The idea of delusion isalso the resultant idea obtained through tamas depending on sattva and rajas. Therefore "sarve...bhavanti[^843]".

[^843]: "Instead of "

[^910]: "The Vivarana has "

 Question—

Then, if in this way, the ideas are respectively of the nature of sattva,of the nature of tamas and of the nature of rajas what is the difference (betweenthem)?

 Answer—

He answers (through the words) "guṇa...śeṣa”, i.e., it is due to therelationship (between the guṇas) as important and subsidiary that there is its designation (as sāttvika, etc.) and its non-designation (as sāttvika, etc.) This is similar to thedesignation (of elements) as belonging to earth or belonging to water or belonging toheat (fire) even though they all have all the five elements (in their composition).

 Because in this manner there is opposition amongst the activities of the guṇas“tasmāt...na iti” (to the wise all is pain). The mention of the contrary nature of theguṇas is in order to kindle superior detachment. In what way? Through the mentionof the pains of changes, anguish and latent impressions, a separate division indicatingthe painful nature of all things with reference to (in connection with) detachment(absence of greed) towards all objects seen and heard has been made[^912].There the ideais that there is detachment when pain is not visible or experienced.

[^912]: "Cf. YS, I.15."

 Whereas here, by stating "guṇavṛttivirodhācca", i.e., by indicating the pain that iscaused by the mutually opposing functioning of the guṇas it conveys the sense that itis proper to have (cultivate) superior detachment towards those manifest and unmanifestqualities (as well[^913]).Thus here also, all (experience) has the nature of all (guṇas) bythe relationships of being important and subsidiary (in every experience); thereforeits characteristic of being both manifest and unmanifest has been indicated. Doing so,even in the sūtra, there is a separate mention of guṇavṛttivirodhācca.

[^913]: "Towards the very nature of things in their intrinsic sense."



 Having the quality of pain due to changes, anguish and latent impressions "tasyai ...vidyā[^910]", i.e. this great collection having the relationship of being important or subsidiary (in every situation) (has avidyā as its source). "tasyā...hetuḥ" (its means ofdestruction is right knowledge) because it can oppose it. As knowledge has as its object truth (reality) and ignorance is based on objects that do not exist, right knowledge alone is the cause of its destruction. This is similar to the destruction of the sightof the unreal non-existent several moons by the sight of the real, existent, one moon.

 It has been shown that ‘all is pain' through the basis of pain having the characteristic of afflictions, action (karma) and fruition of karma (vipāka).That wise personwho is in pain through this (kind of) pain has been designated as the (subject) of thiswork on right vision and not the other who accepts the pain itself (without any effortto get rid of it). He, desiring to indicate this through an example, says "yathā...jyamiti" (The science of medicine has four parts; i.e.,) disease, that which causesdisease, desire to remove the cause, (and) the purpose of the subject of the science ofmedicine, for the sake of health. "evamidam...darśanam[^843]"(this science) is alsofourfold.

[^843]: "Instead of "

 Just as the science of medicine (cure) is brought together under the fourfold headings of disease, the cause for disease, good health (absence of disease) and the curative means for achieving good health in order to indicate its true nature and as a resultof that it is known as fourfold having the four (divisions) as disease, etc., so is this science (of yoga).The world (of change) is filled with pain,it has ignorance in theform of the association of pradhāna and puruṣa as its cause, the destruction (or cessation) of saṃsāra which has a cause is the purpose of right vision and then right vision(is the means)—

thus this science of yoga also has four divisions and so this science isfourfold.Or it is fourfold because with reference to these ends (yoga) has a fourfolddivision[^916]."tatra...iti[^917]"

[^916]: "One could think of the four as avidyā-kleśa-karma-vipāka and again the four repeating itself."

[^917]: "The nature of the liberated is under discussion."

 Objection—But then the sūtra draṣṭā dṛśimātra.....[^918]which defines the liberatedone should mention it.

[^918]: "YS, II.20."

 Answer—

That is no defect. Desiring to indicate the purpose of starting the science(of yoga) Patañjali has described in detail saṃsāra with its afflictions and all whichhas pain as its end. And the subject-matter of this science of yoga is shown as the wisediscriminate one who is in the world and who is extremely troubled by the pain of theworld. The description of that wise discriminate one will begin (therefore) after this(description of pain).This has been indicated in the first sūtra[^919].The purpose of thework about to begin is only right vision. And that is to be indicated when the opportunity comes after the description in detail of the pains of the world—

[^919]: "Cf.YS, II.1."

therefore hesays (here)"tatra...iti”.

 The destroyer (liberated one ) is puruṣa; his (nature is neither one to be sought afteror to be destroyed).

 Question—

Why is this so; one does not see any substance in the world which isnot to be avoided or not to be sought after. Just as in the world, pleasure and themeans to pleasure are to be sought after and pain and the cause of pain is to be avoided,similarly this puruṣa also, being a substance,is fit to have either of the characteristics —this is the idea. Then what if it is so?

 Answer—

Then this is what happens. "hāne... ṅgaḥ" i.e., if it has the property ofbeing destroyed then it can be destroyed.

 Question — What happens when it is destroyed?

 Answer—

Then there will be the contingency of the destruction of (the eternal)ātman.

 Question— What is the defect in that?

 Answer—

We will indicate (show) the defect in the Kaivalyapāda (last pāda).Moreover, since there is the absence of anything other than the destroyer (ātman)there is the unattainability of destruction[^920].

[^920]: "One cannot have the agent and the instrument of action being one and the same."



 If it is said that the ātman is itself the destroyer of ātman then (the answer is)—it isnot so; as there will be contradiction of action in one's own self and absence of anydifference (between the agent and the action). As it is to be destroyed, if the ātman isthe destroyer of ātman, then there has to be a second and a third and so on leading toa lack of finality; because whosoever is the destroyer will also have to be destroyed.Nor is it possible to accomplish the coming into existence of both destroyers at thesame moment. And when there is the coming into existence of both at different timesthe relationship of destroyer and destroyed cannot be satisfactorily explained.  

हातुश्च हेयत्वाभ्युपगमे तस्यानवस्थितत्वाद्धेयसम्बन्धानुपपत्तिः।हातुरनवस्थितत्वे च स्वयमेवहेयत्वप्रतिपत्तेर्हातुर्हानायोद्यमानर्थक्यप्रसङ्गः।हानफलानुपपत्तिश्च।न हि बद्धस्य स्वरूपनाश एव फलम्।मोक्षो हि तस्य फलम्।नापि म्रियमाणोऽपि ज्ञातक्षणान्तरमरणः स्वरूपविनाशमिच्छति।विनाशस्यार्थप्राप्तत्वादेवमनवस्थितश्चेद्धाता न स्वरूपहानमिच्छेत्,अर्थप्राप्तेर्हानस्य ॥

 यथा च हातुर्नित्यत्वं तथा द्रष्टृसूत्रे कैवल्यपादे च व्याख्यास्यामहे।तस्मान्न हेयत्वधर्मा पुरुषः।संसारस्तुमहदादिव्यक्तिः दुःखबहुलो हेयः।तत्तुल्यधर्मकः पुरुषो न भवतीत्यर्थः।तत्तुल्यधर्मकत्वे तस्योच्छेदवादप्रसङ्गइति ॥

 If one accepts the destruction of the destroyer there being lack of finality the relationship to the destroyed cannot be satisfactorily explained.And when there is lack offinality to the destroyer (ātman) and because of oneself also attaining destruction, theeffort of the destroyer (ātman) for the sake of destruction has also the contingency ofbeing meaningless[^921]. And the attainment of the result of destruction, i.e., liberationcannot also be satisfactorily explained. The result is not just the destruction of the selfwhich is in bondage. Liberation is its result. Even one who is about to die, knowingthat death is imminent in the next moment, does not desire the destruction of one'strue self. There is a purpose to be reached in destruction and if the destroyer in thismanner, not having any finality, does not desire the destruction of one's self (eventhen) destruction will have to attain its purpose[^922].

[^921]: "One is destroying something in order to be destroyed the next time. Thus this entire exercise becomes meaningless."

[^922]: "So there will be no liberation but only a continuous chain of destruction of the unending puruṣas."

 And the nature of the permanence of the destroyer (ātman) will be explained by usunder the sūtra draṛṣṭ ...hetuḥ[^923]and in the Kaivalyapāda. Therefore puruṣa does nothave the nature of being destroyed. Whereas the world of change with manifestationslike mahat, etc., is filled with pain (and) is fit to be destroyed. Puruṣa cannot haveproperties similar to that-that is the idea. If it has properties similar to it then“tasyo...ṅgaḥ’ (there will be the contingency of its destruction).

[^923]: "YS, II.17."

तस्यापि सत्त्वादिधर्मत्वं स्यात्, उपादेयत्वान्मृत्पिण्डवत्।ततोऽस्य प्रधानस्य निर्हेतुकं कार्यार्थमुपादानं प्राप्नोति॥

 Then let it be something to be sought after; just as there are substances for the sakeof pleasure and which are the means to pleasure. This is (again) not like that.

 Question—

Why is it not so?

 Answer—

"upādāne...vāda", i.e., then it will have the contingency of being acause. If that is made use of which has connection with the result through the meansof those substances themselves then its use will be without any purpose[^924];and this isbecause there is the absence of any other agent[^925].One for instance, does not acquire a cloth through the cloth itself. It is the case that something is acquired through something else. If there is the impossibility of having another agent there will be the contingency of infinite regress of that also to be sought after through another and thatagain through another and so on.

[^924]: "The means and the end cannot have the same substance serving as the cause and the fruit."

[^925]: "As the substance to be acquired has itself been taken as the means to acquire it there is no other as theacquirer for that. In other words there will be a position where the acquirer exhausts itself through beingthe means to acquire itself."

 Moreover, there will be the contingency of rejecting the theory of 'its being for thesake of another[^926]." It is for the sake of another that something is sought after; thuswhen pradhāna having the characteristics of sattva, etc., is sought after (acquired) it isreasonable to accept puruṣa as its cause; this is just like the potter being the cause inmaking use of the lump of clay for the sake of (making) a pot. If then puruṣa which isthe (ultimate) cause for the use of pradhāna acquires (substances) like pradhāna thenpuruṣa also will have qualities like sattva, etc., since it can be made use of like a lumpof clay and so on. As a result of this the material cause of pradhāna which is for thesake of producing an effect will have no purpose to serve.

[^926]: "Worldly activity as well as liberation is considered to be for the sake of puruṣa in Saṅkhya-Yoga andthat will be threatened if puruṣa itself is the cause."

 अथेश्वरार्थमुपादेयः,पुरुषाणां वा परस्परार्थमिति चेत्,भोग्यत्वाचेतनत्वपरिणामित्वादिदोषसामग्री प्रसज्येत,तस्मान्नापि प्रधानधर्मकः पुरुष इत्युपादाने च हेतुवादप्रसङ्ग इत्युच्यते॥

 तदुक्तम्—

हेतुस्त्वपुरुषो भवतीति।तस्य चोपादाने अहेतुः प्रधानवृत्तिर्निर्हेतुकी स्यात्।न च स्वयं स्वार्थंशक्यं विज्ञातुम्।प्रकाशादिषु स्वार्थत्वादर्शनात् ॥

 If it is said that it is for the sake of īśvara that it is acquired or for the sake mutuallyof the various puruṣas, then the answer is that this will lead to the undesirable consequence of having a host of defects like having experience, having insentience, havingmutation, etc. Therefore puruṣa is not something having properties like pradhāna;therefore he says "upādāne... prasangaḥ[^927]".

[^927]: "The Vivaraṇakāra adds "

 Thus he says "hetustvapuruṣo bhavati[^928]". In the event of accepting it as a cause theactivities of pradhāna will have no cause (for activities) and will be without purpose.One cannot possibly understand the meaning (purpose) of oneself through one's ownself; for instance in the case of light, etc., one does not see it as having itself as itspurpose[^929].

[^928]: "While this is not in the bhāṣya the Vivaraṇakāra has it."

[^929]: "A light or lamp is always used to illumine another object-its intention is not to illumine itselfthough that might come to pass."

 “ubhaya... prasangaḥ[^930]"i.e., when there is rejection of being sought after or being destroyed there is the resultant consequence of ātman being eternal. Even thoughpradhāna which is sought after is also eternal still, because of having a changefulnature it is impermanent. (And) in pradhāna there is a multitude of defects like havinga manifold nature, being impure, having ignorance, serving the purpose of anotherand so on. If puruṣas also have the same nature then there will be the contingency ofthere being no liberation. And as there will be no difference in the essential nature ofbondage and liberation and their causes, ignorance and (right) knowledge, there willbe the undesirable consequence of there being no distinction between bondage andliberation. Therefore,by rejecting (the nature of) puruṣa as something to be obtainedor something to be destroyed the theory of permanence (of puruṣa) is reached.“ityetat...nam[^931]."

 This śāstra is described as consisting of four parts (in the following sūtras):

**हेयं दुःखमनागतम् ॥१६॥**

  The pain which is yet to come is to be avoided.

**** दुःखमतीतमुपभोगेनातिवाहितं न हेयपक्षे वर्तते।वर्तमानं च स्वक्षणे भोगारूढमिति न तत्क्षणान्तरेहेयतामापद्यते।तस्माद्यदेवानागतं दुःखं तदेवाक्षिपात्रकल्पं योगिनं क्लिश्नाति, नेतरं प्रतिपत्तारम्।तदेव हेयतामापद्यते ॥१६॥

 The pain which is past has been exhausted through experience; therefore, it cannotfall under the sphere of the avoidable. Present suffering also is being experienced atthe time of its existence; therefore it cannot be considered as avoidable at the nextmoment. Therefore it is only that pain, which is yet to come, which troubles a yogīwho is (sensitive) like an eye-ball and not any other experiencer. That alone is to beavoided.

 Just as the science of medicine, having the purpose of good health, cannot befourfold without the group of four like disease, etc., which includes the patient to becured[^932];so also this (science of yoga), science of right vision, having liberation as itspurpose, cannot be fourfold without the group of four like that which is to be destroyed, etc., different from the nature of the destroyer; thus by indicating the groupof four like that which is to be destroyed, etc., "tade... dhīyate" (this science of yogais described as.fourfold).

[^932]: "If one is dealing with the science of medicine whose end is good health then it will have to deal withthe patient who has the disease and the cure to it."

 Question—

How is this fourfold?

 Answer—

*heyam... gatam*. “duḥkham...tam" = (pain) that is past is pain having the nature of a past life separated from this present life; “tadu...tam" = that hasbeen experienced "na...te" (it cannot fall under the category of what is to be destroyed); because it is already destroyed by itself.

 “vartamānam ca”, i.e., pain belonging to this life, “sva...dham[^933]"is characterisedby present experience, i.e., is characterised by being experienced in the duration ofthe present moment; “tat...dyate" = (that) pain already destroyed by itself throughexperience does not depend on the next moment for its destruction[^934].

[^933]: "Instead of 'svaksane bhogarudham"

[^934]: "As it does not exist in the next moment having exhausted itself by experience."

 "tasmā...¾[^935]"= that which has the characteristic of pain which is to come ina future life after death, that is to be destroyed through right vision[^936]. One shouldstrive only for the absence of any future life and not for restraint of pain that is present(in this life)[^937].If one strives for it in this life, then, because right vision cannot beemployed (here) it will not serve any purpose. Just as a released arrow, present painhas its result already begun. And future pain not having commenced, the restrictionof its seed is proper and right vision is meaningful, as that is the very object of rightvision.

[^935]: "Instead of  "

[^936]: "The emphasis on pain in the future life is not justified. Even pain which has not yet come intoexistence in the present life can also be destroyed. That seems to be the sense of the bhāṣya."

[^937]: "The Vivaraṇakāra seems to be talking about the prārabdhakarma and pain that comes in its wakeeven in the event of jīvanmukti."



 तस्माद्यदेव हेयमित्युच्यते तस्यैव कारणं प्रतिनिर्दिश्यते—

 Therefore the cause of that alone which is mentioned as avoidable is being indicated.

द्रष्टृदृश्ययोः संयोगो हेयहेतुः ॥१७॥

 The cause of that which is to be avoided is the association between the seer andthe seen.

 द्रष्टा बुद्धेः प्रतिसंवेदी पुरुषः।दृश्या बुद्धिसत्त्वोपारूढाः सर्वे धर्माः।तदेतद् दृश्यमयस्कान्तमणिकल्पं संनिधिमात्रोपकारि दृश्यत्वेन स्वं भवति पुरुषस्य दृशिरूपस्य स्वामिनः।अनुभवकर्मविषयतामापन्नं यतः।अन्यस्वरूपेण प्रतिलब्धात्मकं स्वतंत्रमपि परार्थत्वात् परतन्त्रम्।

तयोर्दृग्दर्शनशक्त्योरनादिरर्थकृतःसंयोगो हेयहेतुर्दुःखस्य कारणमित्यर्थः॥तथा चोक्तम्—तत्संयोगहेतुविवर्जनात्स्यादयमात्यन्तिकोदुःखप्रतीकारः।

 The seer is puruṣa who knows, by reflection, the intellect. Objects are the properties deposited in the 'sattva' intelligence. This object of experience is like a magnet;it helps by its mere proximity because, having the quality of being seen,it becomesthe property of puruṣa the master, whose nature is awareness, because it becomes theobject of experience (of puruṣa). Though different in nature (insentient by nature) ittakes on the nature (sentience) of another.Though independent, because of fulfillingthe object of another, it is dependent on another. The beginningless association between the power of knowing and the capacity to be known, of these two, which is foraccomplishing a purpose, is the cause of 'saṃsāra ' (heya) or the cause of suffering. Inthis connection it has been said—

'By the removal of the cause of association (withthe intellect) there will be the absolute remedy for pain."

 कस्मात् ?दुःखहेतोः परिहार्यस्य प्रतीकारदर्शनात्।तद्यथा—

पादतलस्य भेद्यता, कण्टकस्य भेतृत्वं,परिहारः कण्टकस्य पदानधिष्ठानं पादत्राणव्यवहितेन वाधिष्ठानम्।एतद्द्वयं यो वेद लोके स तत्रप्रतीकारमारभमाणो भेदजं दुःखं नाप्नोति।कस्मात् ? त्रित्वोपलब्धिसामर्थ्यादिति।अत्रापि तापकस्यरजसः सत्त्वमेव तप्यम् कस्मात् ? तपिक्रियायाः कर्मस्थत्वात्।सत्त्वे कर्मणि तपिक्रिया नापरिणामिनिनिष्क्रिये क्षेत्रज्ञे।दर्शितविषयत्वात्सत्त्वे तु तप्यमाने तदाकारानुरोधी पुरुषोऽनुतप्यत इति ॥१७॥

 How is this possible? Because remedy for the cause of pain, which can be removed, is seen (in the world). For example, the sole of the foot is capable of beingpierced; the thorn has the capacity to pierce; the remedy is, 'not to place the foot onthe thorn' or ‘to place the foot when it is covered by a shoe'. Whoever in the worldknows these three, secures the remedy and does not undergo the pain due to thepiercing. How is this possible? By the capacity to understand its threefold character.Here also, for the 'rājasa guṇa' which disturbs, the 'sattva-guṇa' is the disturbed.How is that? Because the action of disturbance can abide (only) in an object and notin the unchanging, actionless 'kṣetrajña'. When the 'sattva guṇa' is disturbed, thepuruṣa which assumes its form, because of being shown the object, is also disturbed.

 तदेतच्छास्त्रं चतुर्व्यूहमभिधीयत इत्युक्तम्।एकश्चतुर्षु व्यूहः प्रतिपादितः हेयं दुःखमनागतमिति।इदानींद्वितीयो व्यूहः तस्य दुःखस्य कारणं, हेतुः प्रतिनिर्दिश्यते ॥

 It has been said that this science of yoga is fourfold. Amongst these four one of thedivisions has been indicated as heyam....tam. Now the second division which is thecause for that pain, the reason (for that pain) will be mentioned.

 Objection—But then,the cause for pain has already been indicated, and has beensummarised accordingly at the end (through the words) "tasyai...avidyeti[^938]".

[^938]: "In the bhāṣya under II.15 towards the end."

 Answer—Yes, that is true. But earlier what has been shown is only the nature ofpain and only the nature of its cause. Here is shown not just its own nature but thecause for that nature. Thus draṣṭṛ...hetuḥ.

द्रष्टा च दृश्यं च द्रष्टृदृश्ये।तयोर्द्रष्टृदृश्ययोरिति।द्रष्टृदृश्यसंयोग इति तु वक्तव्ये पृथग्विभक्तिग्रहणंतयोर्भिन्नजातीयत्वख्यापनार्थम्।भोक्तृभोग्ययोः स्वस्वामिनोः प्रधानपुरुषयोरिति वा सूत्रयितुं शक्यत एव।तथापि द्रष्टृदृश्यग्रहणमनेन द्रष्टृदृश्यत्वेनैव संयोगो नान्यथेत्येवमर्थम् ॥

 The word drastr yoh is formed as follows: the seer and the seen is both the seerand the seen, i.e, draṣṭṛdṛśye. The genitive dual of that is draṣṭṛdṛśyayoḥ.If it were tobe mentioned as draṣṭṛdṛśyasaṃyogaḥ (i.e, as one word in the sūtra) then one willhave to understand them as having different case endings, in order to indicate theirhaving different class properties. The sūtra could also have been worded as bhoktṛbhogyayoḥ or svasvāminoḥ or pradhānapuruṣayoḥ. Even then the point is that theunderstanding of the seer and seen is only through this contact, through the relationship of seer and seen and not through any other[^939].

[^939]: "The point is the seership and seenship and their contact which gives rise to the world with all itsattendant problems. So by using other synonyms like puruṣa, pradhāna or sva, svāmin or bhoktṛ, bhogyathe emphasis on that aspect will have to be further explained. But in these two words draṣṭṛ, dṛśya, thepoint is immediately made."

 (Puruṣa) will be characterised as “draṣṭā puruṣaḥ". He who has the nature ofknowing by reflection is “pratisaṃvedī". What does he know? “buddheḥ" = he knowsthe intellect (and its contents). The intellect is (known) “dṛśya”; i.e., the internal organ through its ideas (is known[^940]).

[^940]: "No distinction is drawn between buddhi and antaḥkaraṇa here."

 Objection—But then, the objects like sound, etc., are also fit to be known.

 Answer—"sattvo... dharṃāḥ", i.e., objects like sound and so on, deposited in



the sattva intelligence are known in the shape of ideas of intelligence and not itself[^941].If it itself is known then puruṣa will have the nature of having objects both known andunknown. But logically puruṣa is established as having always the nature of knowingobjects.Therefore it is only those properties deposited in the intellect that are known.  

[^941]: "The intellect per se is not known but only the thoughts in it. The objects are also not known bythemselves but as deposited as ideas in the intellect."

 "tade... kalpam"; just as the magnet pervades the iron filings for the sake ofaction (movement) so also "puruṣasya... minaḥ” (the object) having the two kindsof goals of puruṣa in the form of experience and liberation by pervasion is like amagnet (and being seen it becomes the property of the master) who is of the essenceof consciousness.

 कथं स्वमित्यत आह—कर्मविषयत्वमापन्नं कर्मैव विषयः कर्मविषयः, कर्मत्वापत्तिरेव।विषयो दृशिरूपस्यदृश्यतामापन्न इत्येतत्।कथम्भूतंसत्कर्मविषयतामापद्यत इति तद्विशेषणार्थमाह–अन्यस्वरूपेण प्रतिलब्धात्मकमिति ॥

शब्दाद्याकारेण लब्धात्मकं सद्दृश्यत्वेन कर्मतामापन्नंभोगार्थेन स्वं भवति ॥

 Question—How is it the property? In answer he says "karma... nnam[^942]"."karmaviṣayaḥ” = activity is itself the object, i.e., its reaching a state of activity. The objectin the form of the seen reaches a state of being seen[^943].In what state does an objectbecome an object of experience? He mentions the special object as "anya... tmakam".

[^942]: "The Vivaraṇa has “karmaviṣayatvamāpannam” in place of “anubhavakarmaviṣayatāmāpannam"

[^943]: "The act of experiencing the object or seeing the object is the activity of the object which pervadespuruṣa due to proximity."

 “anyasvarūpeṇa” i.e, in the form of oneself and another in the form of puruṣa andobjects like sound, etc.,“pratilabdhātmakam"=having attained a special nature (inthe form of experience) (or) having attained a special nature of puruṣa and objectslike sound, etc.,(or) having attained its nature as belonging to puruṣa by having thequality of being seen,it becomes the object and belongs to puruṣa through the goal ofliberation. Having attained its nature by taking on forms (of the object) like sound,etc., and having the quality of being seen it becomes the object and through the goalof experience it belongs to puruṣa.

 Objection—But then, how can something which is independent have the nature ofbeing a possession? Anything which is independent and functioning on its own does



not stand in need of another. Even that which fulfils the purpose of puruṣa in consequence of its own activity, that is also through its own nature, and it is not fulfillingthe purpose of puruṣa. Therefore it is incorrect for that which exists independently tohave the nature of being a possession.  

 Answer—He says "svatantram.... tantram”, i.e. (as it serves the purpose of another) through accomplishing the twin objects of puruṣa (it is dependent on another)and therefore it is a possession.

 “tayoḥ.... ktyoḥ”,i.e.,having started with draṛṣṭ....yoḥ he (Vyāsa) concludes itas “dṛg.... tyoḥ[^944]”.The association of the intellect and puruṣa is mentioned in order toindicate its beginningless nature; otherwise there will be a suspicion of its having abeginning as it can come into being only after the rising of the intellect. "dṛg...saṃyogaḥ”, i.e., as the characterised (substances) are eternal[^945]it is logical to accepttheir eternal relationship; therefore beginningless association of their powers of thenature of the seer and the seen "arthakṛtaḥ" is for the sake of accomplishing thepurpose of puruṣa — this is the idea.

[^944]: "The sūtra emphasises puruṣa and prakṛti as the seer and the seen whereas Vyāsa looks upon them ashaving the power to see and the power to be seen."

[^945]: "In this case prakṛti and puruṣa."

 तथा च सत्यनादित्वेऽपि प्रयोजननिवृत्तौ संयोगनिवृत्तिरुपपद्यते।धर्मिणां तु स्वरूपसंयोगः सत्तामात्रेण नप्रयोजनकृत इति नित्य एव।धर्ममात्राभिस्त्वनित्याभिरनित्यः संयोगः।स तु बुद्धिपुरुषसंयोगो हेयहेतुः दुःखस्यकारणम् इत्यर्थः ॥

 Similarly, though it is beginningless, when there is cessation of the purpose, it isproper that the association ceases. Whereas the natural association of the characterised is because of their very existence and not for accomplishing any purpose-so itis eternal[^946].The association which is through the non-eternal qualities alone is non-eternal (temporary). That association between the intellect and puruṣa is the"heyahetuḥ” (the cause of pain).

[^946]: "But is the association eternal ? What about pralaya and mukti."

 Thus it is said in the system—[^947]"tat.... nāt" = by the removal of avidyā which isthe cause of the association of the two, i.e, the intellect and puruṣa.

[^947]: "This is considered to be the words of Pañcaśikhācārya."

 Question — How is this removal possible ?

 Answer—Through knowledge, through right vision, through its opposition, it isremoved. Therefore by removal of the cause of their association "atyan.... kāraḥ" =there arises the absolute (remedy for pain).



 Question—What is it (the remedy) which is right vision? In answer to the questionas to the nature of this (remedy) he gives the well-known example (through the words)"tadyathā", i.e., (The sole of the foot can be pierced) as it is very soft. "kaṇṭa...tvam"=(the thorn can pierce) as it is of a hard nature. Their contact is the special cause forpain. Therein the “parihāraḥ " (remedy) for the pain due to the piercing of the thorn"kaṇṭake..nam"¹ is not to attack the thorn with one's foot. If there is a reason toplace the foot then “pāda...nam"²(it should be covered with some protection)."etat...pnoti"³= He who knows these two, i.e., capacity to be pierced and capacityto pierce or the twofold remedy[^948](he) commences a different cure. (He by commencing the remedy does not undergo the pain) which is caused by the piercing of thethorn.

[^948]: "Not to place the foot on the thorn or to protect the foot when so placed."

 तथेहापि पुरुषः सत्त्वद्वारेण कण्टकस्थानीयं प्रधानम्,तयोर्विशिष्टः संयोगोऽविद्यानिमित्तो दुःखकारणम्,दुःखपरिहारोऽप्ययम्—गुणगौणेभ्यः प्रधानमात्रविशेषेभ्यो दृश्येभ्यो निरपेक्षता,सम्यग्दर्शनेन प्रयोजनाभावंबुद्ध्वा पुरुषस्याविक्रियत्वात् कण्टकाधिष्ठानवच्छरीरारम्भिणो वा कर्मणो नियतवेदनीयत्वादवश्यं फलदायित्वंबुद्ध्वा अप्रार्थितोपनतानां शब्दादीनां सम्यग्दर्शनव्यवहितेन सत्वेन भोगः।एवं परिहारं सञ्जानानःकण्टकभेददुःखपरिहारमिव संसारदुःखं नाप्नोति ॥

 Similarly here also (there is) puruṣa and pradhāna which takes the place of thethorn, through the quality of sattva; their special relationship due to ignorance (avidyā)is the cause for pain and the following is the remedy for (that) pain—the independence (detachment) from the objects (seen) which are special (arrangements) of onlypradhāna (or) which are the guṇas and their derivatives; since puruṣa has no activity(by its nature) there is realisation of the absence of purpose (for puruṣa) through rightvision; similar to placing the foot on the thorn, knowing well that action (karma)started by the body will certainly lead to its result as it is to be experienced in a fixedtime, there is experience of objects like sound, etc., which come into being withoutdesiring for them through sattva which is uninformed by right vision. Bringing intobeing the remedy in this manner, one does not undergo worldly pain like the remedyfor the pain caused by the piercing of the thorn.

  Question— “kasmāt”—how is this possible in this way?

 Answer "tritvo...tyāt"—through knowing the three i.e.,pradhāna,puruṣa andtheir association.In this way one sees the capacity of right knowledge,and when oneis unaware of the threefold experience of the sole of the foot,the thorn and theirassociation one sees (the capacity) of ignorance which is the cause of pain.

 एतमर्थं प्रचिख्यापयिषन्नाह।अत्रापि तापकस्य रजसः।यद्यपि प्रधानं कण्टकस्थानीयं तापकं,तथापिरजसो दुःखात्मकत्वाद्रजोद्वारेणैव प्रधानस्य तापकत्वमित्युच्यते—तापकस्य रजस इति।तस्य रजसः कर्मभूतंसत्त्वमेव तप्यम्।कस्मात् ? छिदिक्रियावत्तपिक्रियायाः कर्मस्थत्वात्।कर्मणि हि तपिक्रिया वर्तते,न

**——————————————————————————————————————————————**

¹The bhāṣya has "kaṇṭakasya" whereas the Vivaraṇa has "kaṇṭake".  
²Instead of just "adhiṣṭhanam" the Vivaraṇa has "padadhiṣṭhānam".  
³Instead of "etattrayam" available we have "etatdvayam" in the Vivaraṇa.



रजसस्तापकस्य विषयिणि पुरुषे।तप्तेश्च फलस्य पुरुषविषयत्वात् ॥

 न हि परशुरछेत्तरि स्वात्म—नि वा वर्तते छिदिर्वा फलं, विषय एव छेद्ये काष्ठादौ।एवं पुरुषस्यैव तप्तिःकर्मणि सत्त्वे वर्तमाना फलं, रजश्च काष्ठादाविव परशुः सत्त्व एव पुरुषस्य दृश्ये वर्तते ॥

 Desiring to explain this idea he (Vyāsa) says—

"atrāpi... sah". Even thoughpradhāna is the tormentor taking the place of the thorn (in the example) still, becauseof the painful nature of the quality of rajas it is only through the rajas quality thatpradhāna has the capacity to cause torment. Thus he says "tāpakasya rajasaḥ". And"sattvam ... pyam" (sattva) which is the object of that rajas (is the disturbed).

 Question—

How is that so?

 Answer—

As in the case of the action of cutting, the action of tormenting abides inan object. "karmaṇi...", i.e., (the action of tormenting) can only exist (in an object)which is the rajas quality and not in the subject puruṣa of the tormentor. This is alsobecause the result of torment has the puruṣa as its object (subject[^949]). The axe, forinstance, does not exist in the cutter or in itself nor is cutting itself the result per se; incutting, it is the object which is cut like wood, etc. (which is the object). In a similarmanner pain is of puruṣa alone which is the result existing in the object sattva; andrajas is the (cutting) axe with reference to objects like wood, etc., (and) of puruṣa itexists in sattva alone which is the object seen[^950].

[^949]: "The result has puruṣa as the ultimate reference point and so puruṣa is the object of this entire activity."

[^950]: "The intellect being predominantly sattva that is what is reflected in puruṣa and is known as the seenobject by puruṣa."

 इतश्च पुरुषे तपिक्रिया न वर्तते।अपरिणामित्वात् द्रष्टुः।तपिरपि हि कर्मविक्रिया।यथा छेदनस्य फलंछेद्यस्य कर्मणो द्वैधीभावो विक्रिया, तद्वत्।नापरिणामिनि निष्क्रिये क्षेत्रज्ञे। अपरिणामित्वं च सदा ज्ञातविषयत्वेनसाधयिष्यति ॥

 यद्येवं पुरुषश्चेन्न तप्यते पुरुषार्थं प्रधानं प्रवर्तत इत्येतदनुपपन्नम्।वृत्तिसारूप्येणोक्तोत्तरत्वात्।तदेवेदमुच्यते—

दर्शितविषयत्वात्।अपरिणामिनोऽविक्रियत्वाद्दर्शितविषयत्वम्।तस्मादृशिकर्मणि सत्त्वे तप्येतदाकारानुरोधी तदाकारानुवर्ती।तदाकारानुरोधित्वं तद्दृशिसन्निधौ बौद्धस्य प्रत्ययस्य दृशिरूपावभासता।यथा लाक्षारससन्निधौ स्फटिकस्य लाक्षाकारावभासता, तथा पुरुषोऽपि तप्यत इत्युपचर्यते ॥१७॥

 From this it follows that the operation of pain does not exist in puruṣa; "apari...tvāt” as the seer is (changeless). Pain (torment) is action in an object. Just as the resultof cutting is the splitting into two of the object that is cut and thus an action, similar isthe case here. "nāpari... jñe", i.e., changelessness is achieved by having the objectknown at all times.

 Question—

If puruṣa is thus not pained and pradhāna operates for the sake of puruṣathat does not seem logical as it is said in reply that (puruṣa) assumes the form of themodification (of the mind).

 Answer—

Thus he says "darśita... tvāt", i.e., it is because there is absence ofactivity in the changeless that there is the object seen. Therefore in the act of seeing“sattve... tapye"³(when sattva is tormented) puruṣa assumes a form similar to it. Inthe proximity of an object of perception, assumption of the form of the object seen,

"In the bhāṣya it is "tapyamāne" while in the Vivaraṇa it is "tapye". There is no "tathā" in the bhāṣya. Instead of "anutapyata" the Vivaraṇa has "tapyata".



which is the thought of the intellect, is the assumption of a similar form (by puruṣa).As in the proximity of red lac a crystal takes on (assumes) the form of red lac so also"puruṣo...ta" (puruṣa also takes on the form of the intellect) figuratively.  

  दृश्यस्वरूपमुच्यते—

  The nature of the seen is being mentioned.

प्रकाशक्रियास्थितिशीलं भूतेन्द्रियात्मकं भोगापवर्गार्थं दृश्यम् ॥१८॥

 The seen is by nature bright, active and inert; its essence are the elements and thesense-organs; it exists for the fulfilment of the purpose of experience and liberation(of puruṣa).

 'Sattva' is by nature bright; 'rajas' is by nature active; ‘tamas' is by nature inert.These guṇas are distinct but they are mutually related; they are ever changing; theyhave the properties of uniting and separating; they give rise to (various) manifestforms by lending support to each other; though existing as principal or subsidiarythey stay distinct, without losing their (individual) power. They follow different manifestations of power in objects of the same class or of different classes.

 When they are dominant (in any phenomenon) their presence is manifested; evenwhen they are subsidiary they can be inferred as included in the dominant by theiractivity. Having their powers employed to serve the purpose of puruṣa they are usefulby their mere presence, like a magnet. Following the activity of one (amongst them)without the modifications (of other guṇas) they are called 'pradhāna'. This is knownas the seen (object).

 This same object consists of the elements and the sense-organs; in the form ofelements it transforms itself into gross and subtle earth, etc., similarly in the form ofthe sense-organs it transforms itself into the gross and subtle sense of hearing, etc.These objects are not without purpose, instead they function by accepting a cause;therefore, the objects exist for fulfilling the purpose of experience and liberation of



puruṣa. Of these, experience is the realisation of the desirable and undesirable natureof the qualities (in puruṣa) obtained by identification (with the intellect). Liberation(apavarga) is the realisation of the true nature of the experiencer (puruṣa). Apart fromthese two there is no other knowledge. In this connection it has been said—

'Thoughthe three guṇas are the agents he who sees all states presented (by the intellect) asnatural to puruṣa who is the fourth, who is similar and dissimilar to the intellect, whois not the agent, who is the witness of the activities of the intellect, does not suspectthe existence of another (pure) knowledge.'

 How can these two—

experience and liberation, created by intelligence and existing only in intelligence be attributed to puruṣa? Just as victory or defeat on the part ofactual fighters is attributed to their master, as he is the one who enjoys the result,similarly, bondage and liberation existing in the intelligence are attributed to puruṣa,because he is the experiencer of the result. When the goals are not achieved bondageis of the intelligence alone; when the goals are achieved it is liberation.Similarly,perception, memory,recollection,rejection,real knowledge and determination, thoughexistent in intelligence, are superimposed on puruṣa, since he is the experiencer ofthe result.

 “dṛśya....te".

 Objection—But then, in the previous sūtra it was said drasṭṛdṛśyayoḥ—thus in theorder in which it is given the nature of the seer is to be first described.

 Answer—

There is no defect in that; as the knowledge of the nature of the seer isdependent on the knowledge of the nature of the object seen. As the object seen hasthe purpose (goal) of the seer, different from itself, it is established that there is adifferent seer. That is why in the previous sūtra[^951]the seer has been positioned first; indescribing its (object's) nature the sequence of the achieved goals will be mentioned.

[^951]: "In YS, II.17. draṣṭṛ is placed before dṛśya."

 "prakāśa ... dṛśyam. The words prakāśa and kriyā and sthitiḥ give rise to theword prakāśakriyāsthitayaḥ (brightness,activity and staying inert).As it is greatlydesired prakāśa is placed as the first (in the compound).When there are many terms



(as in a compound) and there is no order as to which should come first and whichlater, (and) there is no order between the two words kriyā and sthitiḥ so kriyā hasbeen placed before (sthitiḥ) (just like that). That which has these as its nature isprakāśa...lam. That which illuminates is light; that which has that as its nature is"prakāśa ...sattvam".

 Objection—But then, when illuminating is an activity how can its nature be sattva—its nature can only be rajas; also how can the nature of staying fixed be that of tamas?

 Objection—But then again by nature it is itself illuminating as well as being fixed.

 Answer—That is not so.The word "śīla" cannot be used for its intrinsic nature.For instance the mṛdanga player is not said to have the nature of a mṛdanga (drum);one says that he has the knack to play the mṛdanga. No one uses the word "sīla"(having the nature) when it is devoid of any action.

 Objection—But then, being fixed and illumination are both the nature of tamasand sattva.Therefore it follows from that, that the word "śīla” is used in that sense.

 Answer—He says — that is not so.The word “śīla” is not used everywhere in orderto convey the sense of its own nature. Here also when rajas has the nature of pain, byconnecting it to activity through the word "kriyāśīlam" (having the nature of activity)it is designated by the word śīla[^952].So also in the case of staying fixed and illuminationas well, their functions are desired to be indicated.

[^952]: "It is the activity which is indicated by śīla and not its nature which is 'the nature of pain'."

 Question—Is this the considered opinion that activity is also the nature of rajas?

 Answer—Not so; in the state of pradhāna there is equilibrium of the three guṇas;if activity becomes the nature of rajas there will be activity in pradhāna as well in thestate of equilibrium of the guṇas. It is only in the effect state that possessing activityis logical and not at the time of pradhāna (the cause). Therefore the use of the word




×



śīla (nature) is not in the sense of its own nature.

 In that context even sattva and tamas which do not have the nature of activity arepermanently in contact with rajas which has the nature of activity[^953]; it is only theactivity of rajas which makes illumination and fixity (also) possess action throughlending (them) its activity.Thus he says "prakāśa...iti"².Fixity and illuminationare dependent on the activity of rajas for the sake of realising themselves and sincethere is manifestation of only those that are in motion, sattva and tamas are mentioned as possessing that nature.

[^953]: "Then everything will be having activity at all times."

 Therein "prakāśa...iti” sattva is that which has (the nature of illumination); rajasis that which "kriyā..." has the nature of activity; "sthiti..."(and tamas) has thenature of restriction or obstruction. “ityete....gāḥ"³.These guṇas which are mutually related while distinct are "paras... gāḥ".

 यथा प्रकाशशीलमिति सत्त्वमुच्यतेऽत्रैव।रजःक्रियोपरञ्जनात् सर्वावभाससमर्थस्यापि सत्त्वस्यनियतप्रकाशत्वं तम-उपरक्तत्वेन।तथा रजसोऽपि प्रवृत्त्यभिव्यक्तिः सत्त्वोपरागेण।नियतप्रवृत्तित्वं तु तमउपरागेण।तथा तमसोऽपि स्थित्यभिव्यक्तिः सत्वोपरागेण।स्थितिशीलत्वं रजउपरागेण।स्थितिस्तु स्वतएव।रजसोऽपि प्रवृत्तिः स्वतः।सत्त्वस्यापि प्रकाशः स्वत एव।इत्थमेवान्येष्वपि कार्येषु सत्वादीनामितरेतरोपरागोद्रष्टव्यः ॥

 Just as it is said here that sattva has the nature of illumination by the colouring ofthe activity of rajas (so also) sattva which has the capacity of illuminating everythinggets its capacity of continuous illumination due to its connection with tamas. Simi-larly the manifestation of the activity of rajas is due to the connection with sattva anddue to connection with tamas there is continuous activity. In a like manner there ismanifestation of the fixity of tamas due to the connection of sattva; by connectionwith rajas there is a state of continuous fixity and fixity itself is its own nature. So alsorajas has activity as its own nature; sattva also has illumination as its own nature. Inthis way, in other effects as well, one has to realise the mutual dependence of (theguṇas) sattva, etc.

about to come into being there is connection amongst them existing as principal andas subsidiary. Similarly when there arises qualities which oppose the effect which hascome into being there is disconnection amongst them.

 "itare...rtayaḥ", i.e., those embodied objects beginning with mahat (buddhi) upto a clump of grass, having the properties of being (alternatively) the qualified or thequalifier,which are connected to each other by dependence are "itareta...mūrtayaḥ".


"parasparato...api[^954]"—

[^954]: "The bhāṣya has “parasparāngāngītve pi" whereas the vivarana has "parasparato bhinnā api"."

in truth they are different from each other. "asaṃ...bhāgāḥ" they are differentiated by having the capacity to start the production oftotally different effects (products).Thus it is said—when an effect (product) is to bestarted then the powers are mutually very closely connected; when the effect is aboutto begin the divisions of powers are distinguished.At the time of the start of the effect.these divisions are indistinguishable as different.

 "tulya...naḥ". The sattva of the sattva elements (objects) is their class similarity;so also the rajas of the rājasika elements (objects) is their class similarity and thetamas of the tāmasika elements (objects). With reference to each other their classproperties are different. They who have the tendency to follow (manifest) the different powers both in objects of the same class and in objects of dissimilar class are"tulya... pātinaḥ". If any sāttvika, rājasa or tāmasa effect is to be begun it is notpossible to start the effect without the different powers of the three (guṇas) comming-ling (manifesting) themselves. If in this way, in starting each object all the powersthrough differentiation and mingling are of equal importance then “pradhāna ... nāḥ”( at the time of predominance) they are all ( seen as equally present). In each effectwhen the important (constituent) begins to produce its effect the presence of the othertwo as subsidiary are indicated; thus he says “pradhāna.....dhānāḥ[^955]"Not all the(guṇas) have prominence at the same time. If they have the same importance (prominence) then it can only be (the state of) pradhāna and not the commencement of anyeffect.

 Question—How is it that when one single pradhāna has started any single effectone can infer the presence of the others?

 Answer—He says “guṇatve...treṇa”, i.e., even though in the state of subordinance,through their manifest activity in the dominant (guṇa) (one can infer their presence).

 "pradhānāntarnītena[^892]', ' i.e. the activity of the dominant (guṇa) will not occur if theother two are not present in a subordinate state; thus (their presence is inferred) by theactivity of the dominant (guṇa).

[^892]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has "

 “puruṣārtha..[^957].”,i.e, experience and liberation are the goals of puruṣa; theaccomplishment of those according to the rules is the (capacity) to start an effect asand when there is need for fulfilling a purpose—they who have that (capacity) are"purusār...marthyāḥ".

[^957]: "The Vivaraṇa has an additional "

 “sanni...kāriṇaḥ”, i.e., they serve the purpose of puruṣa by their mere presencein the form of different ideas; thus they are "sanni... kāriṇaḥ". (They are thus likemagnets) “ayas ... pāḥ”.

 (With reference to) "pratyayam"=the modification as knowledge "eka....nāḥ”=they follow (one modification amongst them) which has the characteristic of steadiness (which is fixed) "pradhāna... bhavanti”, i.e., there is no pradhāna which isdifferent from that composed of the three guṇas. Those same guṇas, in a state ofequilibrium, get the single designation as pradhāna. When they are disturbed they arecalled mutations (changes) and have (various) modifications.

 "etat...te", i.e., this seen object "bhū...kam" is of the essence of the elementsand of the essence of the sense-organs. He explains the reason for their being of thatnature (through the words) "bhūta...pariṇamate", i.e., in the form of the subtleelements and in the special form of the gross elements; thus its existence as a grossobject is twofold—in the form of the subtle element and in the form of the particularobject. "vipariṇamate[^958]"=it has both the subtle and gross forms. "indriya...namate".

¹The Vivaraṇakāra has "pradhānāntarnītena" instead of "pradhānāntarṇītā".

"indriyabhāvena" = in the form of the sense-organ. "śrotrā...ṇamate" = in the subtle form of the 'sense-of-I' and in the gross form of the ear (sense of hearing), etc."tattu ... nam"; in all instances one observes that activity is with purpose. "apitu....tate"= (on the other hand they function) accepting a purpose. In answer to the question as to the purpose of the activity of the seen object he says "bhogā.....ṣasyeti";just as one finds in the case of fire, etc., (the object serves the purpose of experienceand liberation of puruṣa).

 In answer to the question as to what the two purposes are he says “tatre...”, i.e.,“iṣṭānām"= these (guṇas) (are) like the touch of fragrant wood, sandal paste, etc.,which are favourable, “aniṣṭānām" = (and) those (guṇas) which are unfavourable likethe touch of a sword, thorn, etc.; “svarūpāvadhāraṇam" = knowing its true nature,realising the true nature. Its special characteristic is “avibhāgāpannam" = its non-differentiation in the form 'This is not puruṣa, this is the intellect.' This is because theidea in the intellect has attained the support of consciousness. It is this which iscalled (the experience) of purusa.  

 Therefore (when that witness in the form of pure awareness) is differentiated fromthe idea in the intellect which is of the nature of experience. “svarūpāvadhāraṇam" =the realisation of the true nature of the experiencer as having no more qualificationsand who has even turned away from all subsequent time is called (apavarga).He is atall times abiding in his own nature; in the other state (of activity) the difference isthat there is similarity with the modifications of the mind.

 There is no (other) knowledge apart (from the two)—experience and liberation.As long as there is ignorance there are things which are pleasant and unpleasant-therefore there is experience. As puruṣa has the nature of neither to be sought after orto be avoided[^959],how can there be any experience in realisation[^960], therefore the ideawhich is an opposition to the idea characterised by ignorance and is of the nature ofexperience is the realisation of (the nature of) puruṣa. Because this is so it is notpossible to imagine another third knowledge which is different from this twofold  
knowledge.

[^959]: "It is permanent and not an object to be sought after or to be avoided."

[^960]: "Experience of pleasure or pain in the ordinary sense."

 (Thus it is said) "ayam...śaṅkate[^961]".Thus one who has true insight (into the threeguṇas) which have the qualities already discussed and are responsible for accomplishing all activities, and into the nature of the (fourth, the puruṣa) who has a different nature from that of the guṇas, who is the witness (of their activities), being like awitness of all activities, as he is presented with objects obtained through the guṇashaving the nature of the mind and so on, sees the guṇa objects which have attainedthe form of ideas of the intellect; while receiving them he has the idea ‘this is not-I,this is not mine'; "na darśa...nyat" = it is not possible to (suspect any other) trueinsight; (in other words) there is no other true insight in his (Pañcaśikhācārya's) opinion.

[^961]: "By Pañcaśikhācārya."

 "tāvetau...nau", i.e., (these two—

experience and liberation) (are) accomplishedby the intellect. (How is it attributed to another?) It is seen that something done byone person is attributed to another like the colour of cloth attributed to the washerman.Thus those two (experience and liberation) abiding in the intellect are attributed topuruṣa—

how is that "sa...bhokteti", i.e., he is the experiencer of both the idea ofexperience and true insight.

 The meaning explained is brought to a conclusion through an example (throughthe words) "yathā...jayo veti". "buddhe... bandha", i.e., as long as the intellectconsiders experience and liberation as something to be achieved or as ends, so long it

⁴The bhāṣya has "buddhereva puruṣārthā..." whereas the Vivarana has "buddherevārthā...".





is a bondage. "tadarthā...mokṣaḥ"=there is the coming to end of the purpose ofthat same intellect, i.e., the end of its achievement. When the intellect perceives puruṣadifferent from itself, not related to both experience and liberation, i.e., as not havingany purpose to achieve, that end of its purpose is called liberation of the intellect.

 "etena...sadbhāvaḥ[^962]"=one should understand that (all these various propertiesof the intellect) are superimposed on puruṣa. Since all properties of the intellect arecharacterised without distinction as belonging to the class of ideas, "buddhā...nāḥ”=they are brought into being by the intellect "puruṣe.....vāh"=(and) puruṣa receives(them) (or) puruṣa supports them—thus in this way they are superimposed on puruṣa.

[^962]: "The Vivaraṇa has a different reading."

 “grahaṇam"= the acquisition of (knowledge as) sound, etc., through the ears andso on. “dhāraṇam"=not forgetting what has been received. “vijñānam”=ascertainment of both the special and particular (features) of what is received. “ūhaḥ"=postulating the special properties of what is ascertained due to a desire to know (moreabout it). “apohaḥ"=exclusion of contradictory properties of what is postulated.“kriyā”=activity within the sphere of objects. "vacanam"= the subject-matter ofsentences which is the special modification of the mind. "yathānyāyāvadhāraṇam"=the coherence of a subject to the rules of reasoning and its ascertainment. "abhiniveśa" =the engagement of the mind repeatedly in the task of not wavering from true (valid)knowledge.All these, beginning with knowledge gain existence superimposed on puruṣa. “sa...bhokteti"=(puruṣa is the) experiencer of the result like knowledgeetc.

 दृश्यानां तु गुणानां स्वरूपभेदावधारणार्थमिदमारभ्यते—

 This sūtra is begun with the idea of ascertaining the difference in nature of theguṇas, which constitute the seen objects.

विशेषाविशेषलिङ्गमात्रालिंगा गुणपर्वाणः ॥१९॥

 The particularised, the unparticularised, that which indicates its cause (liṅga) andthat which is without any indicator (of its cause) (aliṅga), are the divisions of theguṇas.

²Each of the words in the compound "grahaṇa..." is being analysed by the Vivaraṇakāra.



  सर्वार्थम्, इत्येतान्यस्मितालक्षणस्याविशेषस्य विशेषाः।गुणानामेष षोडशको विशेषपरिणामः ।

 Amongst them the elements ether, wind, fire, water and earth are the particularised of the unparticularised subtle elements sound, touch, colour, taste and smell.Similarly the ear, skin, eye, tongue and nose are the organs of knowledge; speech,hands, feet, organ-of-excretion and organ-of-generation are the organs of action; mindwhich is the eleventh (organ) is both (the organ of knowledge and organ of action);all these are the particularised of the unparticularised which is the I-sense. Thesesixteen are the particularised mutations of the guṇas.

 There are six which are unparticularised.They are as follows—the subtle elementof sound, the subtle element of touch, the subtle element of colour, the subtle elementof taste and the subtle element of smell which are the five unparticularised, havingrespectively one, two, three, four and five properties such as sound, etc. The sixthunparticularised is the I-sense alone. These six are the unparticularised mutations of'mahat ātman' which is just the awareness of existence. That which is beyond theunparticularised is the indicator alone, the principle of mahat. In that 'mahat ātman'which is just the awareness of existence, these stay and reach their highest point ofexpansion. And reversing the process of creation, they remain in that 'mahat-ātman'which is just the awareness of existence and get merged in 'pradhāna' which has noindicator of its cause, which is neither existent nor non-existent, which is neither realnor unreal, which is not non-existent and which is unmanifested. This (liṅga) is the(third) mutation of the guṇas which is just an indicator of its cause. The mutationcalled ‘aliṅga' is neither existent nor non-existent.

 अलिङ्गावस्थायां न पुरुषार्थोहेतुः।नालिङ्गावस्थायामादौ पुरुषार्थता कारणं भवतीति न तस्यापुरुषार्थता कारणं भवतीति नासौ पुरुषार्थकृतेति नित्याख्यायते।त्रयाणां त्ववस्थाविशेषाणामादौपुरुषार्थता कारणं भवति।स चार्थाहेतुर्निमित्तं कारणं भवतीत्यनित्याख्यायते।गुणास्तु सर्वधर्मानुपातिनोन प्रत्यस्तमयन्ते नोपजायन्ते।व्यक्तिभिरेवातीतानागतव्ययागमवतीभिर्गुणान्वयिनीभिरुपजननापायधर्मका इव प्रत्यवभासन्ते।यथा देवदत्तो दरिद्राति।कस्मात् ? यतोऽस्य म्रियन्ते गाव इति।गवामेवमरणात्तस्य दरिद्रता, न स्वरूपहानादिति समः समाधिः ।

 So the goal of puruṣa is not a cause for the state of ‘aliṅga'. In the beginning, in thestate of ‘aliṅga’, the goal of purusa cannot be a cause; therefore, the goal of puruṣa isnot a cause for that state. Since this state is not caused for serving the purpose ofpuruṣa it is called eternal. In the beginning, in the case of the three special states(viśeṣa, aviśeṣa and liṅga) the cause is the goal of puruṣa; and that goal is the efficientcause (for them); therefore they are called non-eternal.

 The guṇas pervade all the mutations; they neither cease to exist nor come into

×



existence; they appear to have the properties of birth and death because their individual manifestations in which they are present are possessed of the qualities of goingout of existence and coming into being in their past and future forms. For example wesay—Devadatta has become poor. Why? Because his cows are dying. His poverty isonly due to the death of the cows and not due to his own destruction. In a similar way,one has to understand the case of the gunas.  

 लिङ्गमात्रमलिङ्गस्य प्रत्यासन्नं तत्र तत्संसृष्टं विविच्यते, क्रमानतिवृत्तेः।तथा षडविशेषा लिङ्गमात्रेसंसृष्टा विविच्यन्ते, परिणामक्रमनियमात्।तथा तेष्वविशेषु भूतेन्द्रियाणि संसृष्टानि विविच्यन्ते, तथाचोक्तं पुरस्तात्।न विशेषेभ्यः परं तत्त्वान्तरमस्तीति विशेषाणां नास्ति तत्त्वान्तरपरिणामः।तेषां तुधर्मलक्षणावस्थापरिणामा व्याख्यायिष्यन्ते ॥१९॥

 'Liṅga' (mahat) is the immediate effect of 'alinga'. Present there, in an unmanifestform, it is differentiated from that, since the order of change is inviolable. Similarly,the six unparticularised present in the 'liṅga? in an unmanifest form are differentiatedfrom that, because of the fixed order of change. In the same way, the elements andsense-organs present in those unparticularised (aviśeṣeṣu) in an unmanifest form, aredifferentiated from them. And it has been already mentioned that there is no otherprinciple coming after the particularised (viśeṣas).Therefore,there is no further evolution of any principle after the particularised (viśeṣas). Their changes as characteristics (dharma), symptoms (lakṣaṇā) and states ( avasthā ) will be explained later(III. 13).

 "dṛśyānām...bhyate", i.e., this sūtra (is begun) in order to ascertain the difference in the true state of the (gunas) which have been explained (in the previous sūtra)(as) visesāviśesa parvānah. The (compound can be split up as ) 'viśesa' and'aviśesa' and ‘just liṅga' and 'that without liṅga' is (visesā...liṅga).

 It does not move, it does not come from anywhere, it is a substance called pradhāna,so the affix ‘ac' (a) is added to all roots of the class of 'pac' and when added it standsfor denotation (as a substance). The word linga which is a synonym of mark (symbol)is of the neuter gender; and it accomplishes the effect. Or the (word can be explainedas) that which has no mark; ‘liṅga' is understanding, an accurate definition, i.e., aliṅga



is that which is not directly the mark of the substance called pradhāna, thus it is a bahuvrīhi compound[^963].

[^963]: "aliṅga stands for pradhāna or prakṛti here."

 And those beginning with the particularised protect the interest of puruṣa by accomplishing experience and liberation; or they fulfil (bring about) their own mutations; thus the affix 'van' is added in the sense of agency to the root ‘pṛ' by the sūtra anyebhyo'pi dṛśyante[^964]. And that being so, when the word ending in ‘n’ does not denote agency it is used in the neuter gender. That which ends in 'n' denoting agency can be used in all genders as in instances like merudṛśvā, merudṛśvānī[^965].Thus the particularised and others are agents.(In answer to the question) to whom are they connected (the sūtra says) that they are the agents of the guṇas. The words *guṇaparvāṇaḥ* means the agents of the guṇas. In some, the reading is *viśeṣā. . .liṅgāni guṇaparvāṇi[^966].*

[^964]: "Pān. Astā., III.2.75."

[^965]: "Example ending in 'n' being used in both masculine and feminine genders."

[^966]: "In fact this is the reading obtained in available texts today. This is neuter gender and therefore denotes the divisions of the guṇas and not agency."

**“tatra...bhūtāni". Ether comes into being from the subtle element of sound. Wind comes into being characterised by sound and touch from the subtle element of touch. Fire comes into being characterised by sound, touch and colour from the subtle element of colour. Water comes into being characterised by the four—sound, touch, colour and taste from the subtle element of taste. The earth comes into being characterised by the five—sound, touch, colour, taste and smell from the subtle element of smell.

 Objection—But then, ether is eternal as it exists before anything else and it has no particularity of time of destruction. Anything whatsoever that comes into being like for instance earth, etc., is seen to have the particularity of coming into existence first and later being destroyed. Similarly if ether had a beginning it would have the quality of first coming into existence and later being destroyed. That is not the case. Therefore ether is without a beginning.

 Question—If it is said that it has the speciality of absence of giving of space then the answer is—not so. The absence of another embodied one will then be similar in



eternity as [well](http://॑॑# "If space makes way for such a substance then it would be eternal by the same argument.").Ether is eternal also because it has no property of impermanence, (and) like ātman it is all-pervading.

  Answer—This is not so as it is in contradiction to scriptural statements like—‘From that Brahman indeed which is this self, was produced space[^967]’. It is also in contradiction to traditional statements.

[^967]: "Taitt. Up., II.1.1."

 If it is said that ‘it provides space is a figurative expression’ then (the answer is) not so; as there will be the inconsistency of its application to wind, etc. There is the single statement ‘From space emerged air[^83]’(in the scriptures). 

[^83]: "Ibid."

 He who says that it is not non-eternal as there is no particularity before coming into existence is saying that there is permanence due to the absence of particularity. And the presence of particularity means non-permanence (in his case).So also the absence of particularities like awareness, non-awareness, bondage, liberation, etc.. will lead to the inconsistency of non-permanence of the ātman-s in the case of the Vaiśeṣika. And similarly it will lead to the undesirable result of non-permanence of the atoms[^969].

[^969]: "This is fundamental to Vaiśeṣika philosophy."

  Question—But if it is said that the presence or absence of particularity is desired only before and after in the case of that which comes into existence then (the answer is) that is not so—as there will be the inconsistency of accepting the coming into being of ether.

 Question—But if it is said that one who argues that ether comes into being cannot say anything in particular (the answer is) that is not so, as there is the particularity of accomplishing or non-accomplishing the goal of puruṣa. The mark is also not applicable as it is all-pervading.

  And time, space, ether and mind are non-permanent; in the absence of functioning for one's own self they function for the sake of another like pots and so on. And they all come into existence as they are different from pradhāna and puruṣa like pots and so on. Thus ether (is non-permanent because of coming into existence) (and) due to having the quality of being an object for the outer [sense-organ](http://॑# "Sound which is the property of ether is the object of the ear, an external sense-organ."),like pots and so on. As it is of the element essence it is like earth. As it has the property of producing connection between non-permanent substances it is like earth and so on. As it excites the accomplishment (completion) of medical treatment it is like the wind[^970]. The

[^970]: "In Ayurveda ether has a part to play in causing diseases."



excitement of the sky (ether) is reversed by medical treatment (and) thus has increased the reputation of medical practitioners. By (all) this the similarity of non-permanence has been explained[^971].

[^971]: "This is against the permanence theory advocated by the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣikas."

 These “bhūtāni...viśeṣāḥ” (elements) are particularised as they have many special characteristics like tranquillity, violence, delusion, etc.The subtle elements are unparticularised due to the absence of (special properties like) tranquillity and so on.

 "tathā śrotra...indriyāṇi" = serving the purpose of the intellect through objects like sound, etc., are inferred through knowledge of their (respective) objects. "vāk...indriyāṇi" = they accomplish actions like speech, etc., and are inferred through them (respectively).

 Question—If it is said that the sense-organs of action like speech, etc., are not established (proved) then the answer is—that is not so, as it is well-known in the scriptures. With reference to the senses there is the following scriptural statement “As the organ of speech is the one goal of all Vedas[^972].”

[^972]: "Br. Up., II.4.11."

 In the traditional sources as well, everywhere in dealing with topics like injunction and prohibition, as it has reference to activity and inactivity (withdrawal), it belongs to the category of the senses like the ear, etc. In such statements as ‘The speech is not to be unsteady, the hands and feet are not to be trembling[^973]’it is established that they deal with topics like injunction and prohibition having reference to activity and inactivity.

[^973]: "MS, IV. 1.77."

 Thus the sense-organs of speech, etc., having skill are like the eye, etc[^974]. In all bodies the instrumental activity of the capacity of the senses is seen (and) is indeed desired. In the case of serpents and such groups of dumb beings having mouth and organ of excretion, the mouth itself is the organ of excretion.

[^974]: "The sense-organs of action are as important as the sense-organs of knowledge."

  “ekādaśam...ṛtham” = (the mind) has the past, future and present as its objects as well as the sense-organs of knowledge and the sense-organs of action as its [objects.](http://॑# "All these come within the sphere of the mind.")

 “etāni... viśeṣā”? = all these eleven sense-organs are (the particularised of) that (unparticularised asmitā). (The derivation of) asmitā is ‘the state of being I’, i.e., ‘it is an awareness of being-I’, that which has that property is “asmitālakṣaṇaḥ". Ahaṃkāra (or the sense-of-I) is the sixth unparticularised principle which is distinguished by the mark of awareness of the sense-of-I.

 “guṇānām” and so on. Of the (guṇas) sattva, etc., which exist in an unparticularised state (these 16 are particularised mutations). Ether is predominantly sattva (tranquil); wind is predominantly rajas, fire is predominantly sattva (tranquil) and rajas (active) (also water is like that);[^975] earth is predominantly sattva (tranquil) and tamas (inert) as it is grasped (as an object). Even though there is the quality of tamas, the quality is created by the predominant guṇa in all these[^976].

[^975]: "It is interesting to see this classification of the elements."

[^976]: "Every object, small or big, including the elements have all three guṇas in their composition; but the nature of the object is determined by the predominant guṇa."

 As the instruments have illumination they are predominantly sattva (bright); the sense-organs of intelligence (knowledge ) which are six along with the mind are pre-dominantly sattva, due to being mainly (importantly) bright. The sense-organs of action having activity as important are predominantly rajas (active).

  “ṣaḍaviśeṣāḥ...” and so on[^977]. Even that which has two properties is known by its predominant guṇa. Thus "rūpamātramiti[^978]" even that which has three properties is known by its predominant guṇa[^979]." Similarly in the case of the next two also[^980] the word

[^977]: "The reading in the bhāṣya is “śabdatanmātram, sparśatanmātram” but the Vivaraṇakāra has “śabdamātram, sparśamātram"

[^978]: "Again the Vivaraṇa has “rūpamātram" instead of “rūpatanmātram.""

[^979]: "Fire has three qualities but is known by the prominent guṇa as having colour."

[^980]: "Water and Earth which are the next two."



“matra[^981]” is for the sake of differentiating the special property such as tranquillity[^982],violence[^983],etc., “eka... bhēdāḥ = having one property of the essence of sound is the distinction of the subtle element of sound. Having the qualities of sound and touch is the distinction of the subtle element of touch. In this manner by increasing one by one the later (subtle elements) can be understood. “ṣaḍa... mātraḥ” = with reference to the subtle elements such as sound, etc., the sixth (I-sense) is the unparticularised of the eleven sense-organs[^984].

[^981]: "The Vivaraṇakāra consistently uses “mātra” in place of tanmātra”."

[^982]: "Associated with sattva."

[^983]: "Associated with rajas."

[^984]: "Five tanmātras, five senses of knowledge and five senses of action."

 “ete sattvamātrasya[^985]”, i.e., of the bare awareness of existence “liṅgamātrasya[^986]” in a bare embodied form[^987]—this is the first manifestation (embodiment) of the disembodied pradhāna, similar to the taking on the sprout stage of a seed. “ātmanaḥ.... and so on, i.e., of the substance mahat which is greater than all the particularised and the unparticularised there are “ṣaḍaviśeṣapariṇāmāḥ = only these six unparticularised mutations of the guṇas sattva, etc., which are in the state of mahat “aviśeṣapariṇāmāḥ[^988]”.

[^985]: "The reading available is “sattāmātrasya” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “sattvamātrasya”."

[^986]: "Again the Vivaraṇakāra has “liṅgamātrasya” in place of “liṅgamatram” in the bhāṣya."

[^987]: "There is an awareness of separateness of individuality in a rudimentary sense at this stage."

[^988]: "Nothing new is added by repeating this again after having mentioned it already."

  “yattatparam...” and so on; because of its greatness (in subtlety) they rest in this mahat which is of the essence of cause “vivṛddhikāṣṭhām” (and reach) the limit of (expansion) such as the particularised earth, etc.

 “pratisaṃsṛjyamānāśca” = the unparticularised in the process of involution (reversal of process of evolution) “tasmin...” and so on (stay in mahat and get merged in pradhāna[^989]). What is its special characteristic? “nissattāsattam”, i.e., it is devoid of any special or non special property.“nissadasad”, i.e., it is existent as it is just a little mutated in comparison to the unmanifested (pradhāna); as it is subtler than the unparticularised it is (called) non-existent; thus the principle of mahat is called “sadasad” existent and non-existent. The “avyakta” is devoid of that property and so is “nissadasad”.

[^989]: "The Vivaraṇakāra adds the word “liṅgamātre” which is not in the bhāṣya. Nothing new is added to the bhāṣya explanation."

 “eṣa...pariṇāmaḥ”, i.e., of the guṇas sattva,etc., (it is the indicator alone) staying in which the unparticularised reach full growth and to which they return in involution[^990].“aliṅgapariṇāmaḥ” that (which is both existent and non-existent and is

unmanifest) is the (unmanifested change[^991]) of those very guṇas. Beyond that there is no subtle mutation of the guṇas as it has already been explained that ‘The subtle object extends up to the aliṅga[^992]’.

[^991]: "As pradhāna reproduces itself, it is called a change."

 “aliṅga...hetuḥ” = In the aliṅga[^993]state (the goal of puruṣa is not there as cause); the state of aliṅga does not have the reason of the goal of puruṣa as its cause; it means that the state of aliṅga is not used for achieving the goal of puruṣa[^994]. He explains it as "nāliṅgā...kāraṇam”. Why is it that state is not for serving the goal of puruṣa? He answers (the question) as “yasmāt...vidyate[^995]” = (therefore in this state the goal of puruṣa is not a cause). By itself also “nāsau...yate[^996]” = since like mahat, etc., it is unknown[^997]even to Īśvaras[^998]. Since it is of this nature therefore "nityā vyākhyāyate” (it is called eternal). That which serves the purpose of puruṣa is seen to be non-eternal such as earth, etc., (but) this state of pradhāna does not serve the goal of puruṣa—so it is called eternal.

[^993]: "aliṅga stands for prakṛti."

[^994]: "There is too much repetition of the same idea here. Will Śaṅkara write this way."

[^995]: "This line is missing in all available bhāṣya readings."

[^996]: "Instead of “puruṣārthakṛteti” the Vivaraṇakāra has “puruṣārthatā"

[^997]: "There is the possibility of being aware of all principles up to the stage of mahat but not beyond it, which is the state of pradhāna."

[^998]: "Who are the Īśvaras that are mentioned here. Are they the various gods that represent functions or liberated puruṣas."

 “trayāṇām...puruṣārthatā” (initially) in the case of the particularised, unparticularised and liṅga principles, the state of mahat, etc., was to serve the goal of puruṣa. “sa...vyākhyāyante[^999]” = and that goal of puruṣa (is their cause) therefore the three states beginning with mahat (are called non-eternal).

[^999]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has “vyākhyāyante" in place of “ākhyāyante" in the bhāṣya"

  “guṇāstu...naḥ” = (the guṇas) are the basis for all mutations. Just as a serpent is



accompanied by the qualities of length, curved movement and the coils, etc., (of the serpent) so also the guṇas are accompanied by the principles such as particularisation, etc.; they accompany the substances and knowledge (and) “na...yante[^1000]” (they neither cease to exist nor come into existence[^1001]).Just as a serpent does not go out of existence when the coils, etc., go out of existence and does not come into being when that comes into being so is the case with the guṇas. So also (to give another example) when a pot, a pan, etc., cease to exist (as a pot, or pan, etc.,) or when they come into existence, the clay neither ceases to exist nor comes into existence[^1002].

[^1000]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has “pralīyante” for “pratyastamayante” in the bhāṣya."

[^1001]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything new to the bhāṣya."

[^1002]: "It is already there as the underlying principle."

 The qualities “vyakti...bhāsante” through their (individual manifestations) having the three qualities, “gunānvayinībhiḥ” = having the guṇas as the material causes (underlying principles), appear to come into being and to cease to exist but in truth they neither cease to exist[^1003] nor come into being[^1004].

[^1003]: "Instead of “upajananāpāyadharmakā” the Vivaraṇakāra has “upajanāpāyadharmakā”."

[^1004]: "This is in keeping with the Sānkhya-Yoga theory.."

 He gives an example of this truth (in the following words) “[yathā...samādhiḥ](http://॑# "Here again the Vivaraṇakāra has “yenāsya” instead of “yatośya”.")”. The argument brings out the similarity between the comparison and the compared. (Thus) similar to the poverty of Devadatta (due to the death of his cows) the principles mahat, etc., which have the guṇas as their basis, have expansion of the guṇas (into their respective products) when there is growth in a mysterious churning of the guṇas and in their recession there is the poverty (of the products or their cessation); and in truth there is neither cessation of existence or coming into existence (of the guṇas)—therefore there is a similarity in understanding.

 If everything is a product of pradhāna how is it that the particularised or the unparticularised do not come into existence immediately (in evolution[^1005]). He (Vyāsa) answers (that in the following words) "liṅga ...sannam[^1006]". Just as the root (of a tree) is close to the tree, ( it is ) present in the seed (and) it is the root itself that first differ-

[^1005]: "Why cannot they be the first evolutes if everything is an effect of pradhāna asks the opponent."

[^1006]: "Instead of “liṇgamātramaliṅgasya...” the Vivaraṇakāra has "iṅgasyāiṅgam.....""



entiates itself and not the later stage of the tree (like leaves, etc.). Similarly, in the pradhāna “tat” = liṅga (mahat) “saṃsṛṣṭam” = lies ( is present ) (and) “āvirbhavati” reveals itself first, and not later; the particularised (do not come first) because of being hidden (at this stage). He mentions that as “kramānativṛtteḥ[^1007]”, i.e., as the order (of evolution) cannot be violated. In the world when something comes into existence there is no violation of the order of evolution.

[^1007]: "The reading in the Vivaraṇa is “kramānatipatteḥ”."

 “tathā...ṣāḥ” (the six unparticularised) earlier mentioned being closely present in the (liṅga) “samsṛ...cyante" (are differentiated from it).In answer to the question why this is so he says “pariṇāma...māt[^1008]” (due to the order of mutation).“tathā...yāṇi”, i.e., the elements closely present in the subtle elements are differentiated (from them).In the bare sense-of-I (are closely present) the sense-organs[^1009]along with the mind.

[^1008]: "The Vivaraṇakāra just repeats what the bhāṣya says."

[^1009]: "Both the senses of knowledge and of action."

 तथा चोक्तं पुरस्तात्।न विशेषेभ्यः प्रागुक्तेभ्य आकाशादिभ्यः परं तत्त्वान्तरमस्ति।न विशेषाणामन्यस्तत्त्वान्तरपरिणाम इत्यर्थः।एतदेवाह—विशेषाणां नास्ति तत्त्वान्तरमिति।तत्त्वं हि नाम साधारणं सर्वप्राणधारिणामामहाप्रलयस्थायि।नैवंलक्षणं पृथिव्यादिभ्य उत्पद्यमानमन्यदस्ति।धर्मलक्षणावस्थापरिणामास्तु भवन्त्येवेति।तेषां तु विशेषाणां धर्मलक्षणावस्थापरिणामा व्याख्यायिष्यन्ते तृतीयपादे ॥१९॥

 Thus it has already been [mentioned](http://॑# "In this bhāṣya itself, earlier.") that there is (no other principle) besides ether, etc., which are already mentioned. It means that there is no other mutation beyond that of the particularised (principles). He mentions that as “viśeṣā...ntaramasti”. A principle is common and abides in all living beings up to the time of the great dissolution. Such another of this nature does not come into existence from earth and so on. On the other hand, there comes into existence mutations of property, of time and of state. In the third chapter (pāda) “dharma...yiṣyante” = (will be explained these mutations) of the “teṣām” = particularised (principles).

** ** व्याख्यातं दृश्यम्।अथ द्रष्टुः स्वरूपावधारणार्थमिदमारभ्यते—

 Knowledge has been explained. Now this sūtra is begun in order to ascertain the true nature of the seer.

द्रष्टा दृशिमात्रः शुद्धोऽपि प्रत्ययानुपश्यः ॥२०॥

  The seer is consciousness alone; though pure, he witnesses the modifications (ofthe mind).

 दृशिमात्र इति दृक्शक्तिरेव विशेषणापरामृष्टेत्यर्थः।स पुरुषो बुद्धेः प्रतिसंवेदी।स बुद्धेर्न सरूपो नात्यन्तं विरूप इति।न तावत्सरूपः।कस्मात्?ज्ञाताज्ञातविषयत्वात् परिणामिनी हि बुद्धिः,तस्याश्च विषयो गवादिर्घटादिर्वा ज्ञातश्चाज्ञातश्चेति परिणामित्वं दर्शयति।  


** **सदा ज्ञातविषयत्वं तु पुरुषस्यापरिणामित्वं परिदीपयति।कस्मात् ?न हि बुद्धिश्च नाम पुरुषविषयश्च स्याद् गृहीताऽगृहीता चेति सिद्धं पुरुषस्य सदा ज्ञातविषयत्वं ततश्चापरिणामित्वमिति।किं च परार्था बुद्धिः संहत्यकारित्वात्, स्वार्थः पुरुष इति।



 Consciousness alone; this means that he is the power of consciousness alone without being touched by any qualification. This puruṣa knows the intelligence (mind) by reflection. He is neither similar nor totally dissimilar to the intelligence. ‘He is not similar’—Why? Because the intelligence has objects (sometimes) known and (sometimes) unknown ( to it), intelligence is changeful. Its objects such as cow, pot &c., are (sometimes) known and (sometimes) unknown; this indicates its changing character.

 Whereas, having its object always known, indicates the unchanging nature of puruṣa. Why? It cannot be that intelligence is the object of puruṣa and is not known (sometimes); from this it is proved that puruṣa always has its object known and therefore, he is unchanging. Moreover, intelligence exists for the sake of another since it acts by combining various causes; but puruṣa exists for its own sake.



तथा सर्वार्थाध्यवसायकत्वात्त्रिगुणा बुद्धिस्त्रिगुणत्वादचेतनेति।गुणानां तूपद्रष्टा पुरुष इति।अतो न सरूपः ।

  Thus because intelligence determines all objective phenomena (as tranquil, cruel or deluded) it is composed of the three guṇas; and because it is composed of the three guṇas it is insentient. Puruṣa is one who knows by proximity the guṇas. Therefore, he is not similar (to intelligence). Then let it be said that he is dissimilar (to intelligence). He is also not totally dissimilar. Why ? Because, though he is pure, he witnesses the modifications (of the mind); i.e., he is aware of the modification which pertains to the mind. Being aware of that modification he appears to be similar to it (intelligence) though he is dissimilar to it. In this connection it has been said—‘The power of the experiencer has no change and has no movement; appearing to have movement in the changeful object (intelligence) it becomes identical with its modification.’And by resembling the modification of the intelligence (mind) which has received the reflection of consciousness it is spoken of as manifestation of knowledge through identity with the modification of the mind.

“vyākhyātam dṛśyamr”= the seen has been explained.(The nature of) that for whose purpose it is the seen, (in order to define its nature this is begun)—*draṣṭā dṛśimātraḥ śuddho’pi pratyayānupaśyaḥ.*

* draṣṭā* = it is puruṣa who possesses (obtains) the seen of the described nature. Its nature is as follows—*dṛśimātraḥ*...*paśyaḥ*. It has been earlier explained as ‘At that time the seer abides in itself[^1010]’ and ‘At other times it has the same form as the modification (of the mind[^291])’. It is the same twofold (definition) which is being pointed out here. And what has been described (earlier) (as) “Puruṣa is conscious byreflection[^1012]” is also being pointed out here.

[^291]: "YS, I.4."

[^1010]: "YS, 1.3."

[^1012]: "Vyāsabhāṣya under YS, I.7."

* dṛśi* is insight, perception, that alone is *dṛśimātraḥ*; as it is like that it is *śuddhaḥ* (pure). Though pure *pratyayānupaśyaḥ*[^1013] (he witnesses the) idea of the intellect because of being bare insight (consciousness). Therefore, by following (witnessing) that idea it becomes that idea (modification of the intellect) itself. In the presence of insight (consciousness) there is a false sense of knowledge in the modification (of the intellect and) that is the similarity of the seer with the modification. As this pure insight of the essence of non-activity has the same form of perception as the modification of the intellect so it is proven that it is established in itself. *pratyayānupaśyaḥ* this leads to the inference of its existence. How is that possible? In the case of seen objects like pots and so on, it is seen that they are perceived by someone other than themselves, and the light (illumination), etc., which lights up those (objects) are also seen to be different (from them). Similarly, in the case of ideas (knowledge) which bring to light everything, it is known that being known, they have to be in essence different objects of perception as in the case of pots, etc., and in the case of their illuminators[^1014].

[^1013]: "Instead of pratyayānupaśyaḥ the Vivaraṇakāra has pratyayasyānupaśyaḥ."

[^1014]: "Thus knowledge as a known phenomenon must also have an illuminator."

  And because it follows the same perception as that of the intellect it perceives that alone; as it does not, at any time, not perceive knowledge of its own object therefore it is of the nature of bare consciousness. The word “mātra” is used in order to exclude any other quality. By this, this much is established, i.e., there is consciousness of the seer; it is also established that it is not the support of qualities such as desire, [etc.](http://॑॑॑# "It is clear from the previous sentence that purușa does not have any other quality except pure consciousness. It therefore appears that the word “icchādisamānāśrayatvam” should read as “icchādisamānānāśrayatvam”. It seems to be an oversight. In the Nyāya system for instance the ātman is also associated with qualities like desire, volition, effort, etc."),



since there is perception only in one who has consciousness. This is mentioned as “drśimātra iti”. “dṛkśaktireva” = knowing is itself insight; that power is “dṛkśaktiḥ”.There is no other having the power of knowing. That itself is the power, i.e., insight. He explains the meaning of the word “mātra” as “viśeṣe... rthaḥ[^1015]”, i.e., he is untouched by qualities of guṇas, i.e., specially by any such qualities like desire, etc.

[^1015]: "The bhāṣya reading is “viśeṣaṇāparāmṛṣṭaḥ” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “viśeṣeṇāparāmṛṣṭaḥ”."

  “sa...saṃvedī” = he who has the nature of reflection is “pratisaṃvedī”. It means that it has the nature of receiving the idea of the intellect. How is it known that puruṣa knows the intellect by reflection, is of the nature of pure consciousness and is pure? He answer (through the words)— “sā...virūpa iti”, i.e., he is not similar nor is he totally dissimilar (to intelligence). Because of dissimilarity it is of the nature of pure consciousness alone, and also pure (in essence).Not being totally dissimilar there is similarity in (being aware of) the modification of the mind.

  Then how is there no similarity? He asks—“na...sarūpaḥ”. “kasmāt” = what is the reason? He mentions the nature of intelligence in order to indicate its difference as “jñātā...buddhi”. In answer to the question as to the nature of the object of intelligence which is both known and unknown he says “tasyā...jñātaśca” = that (object) is known when intelligence is transformed into the form of the outside (object); and that is unknown when (the intelligence) is not transformed into the form of (the outside object).

 If the intelligence is not transformed (and) the object is known without being subject to change then the intelligene will be possessed of the object at all times. Therefore, having objects as (sometimes) known and (sometimes) unknown indicates the changing nature of intelligence. The intelligence is changeful having objects known and unknown[^1016].It is similar to the eye, light (and the object[^1017]).

[^1016]: "He just repeats what the bhāṣya says."

[^1017]: "The eye comes into contact with the object through light. All three conditions must be fulfilled for seeing the object, i.e., light, object and contact of eye with object."



  Puruṣa is of an opposite nature having the object always known. Puruṣa always has his object known. Therefore “sadā....dīpayati[^1018]”. In answer to the doubt “kasmāt” = that it is not established that the object is always known to puruṣa he says “na hi” and so on. The word “hi” is used to denote that it (the reason) is well-known. “buddhiśca nāma” = here “buddhi” stands for the idea (knowledge) of buddhi (intelligence). “puruṣasya....ceti[^1019]”, i.e., the knowledge of the intelligence is grasped at all times.

[^1018]: "The Vivaraṇakāra leaves out “tu” from the bhāṣya reading."

[^1019]: "Instead of “puruṣaviṣayaśca” the Vivaraṇa has “puruṣasya viṣayaḥ”."

 It is only because that is not violated that the different nature of puruṣa is established. Thus puruṣa has its object known at all times. And because of that its unchangeful nature is established. The conclusion is that puruṣa is unchangeful. The mark is because of having its object known at all times. The dissimilar example is (like) intelligence and others[^1020].

[^1020]: "The Vivaraṇakāra is presenting it as a syllogism."

 ननु च बुद्ध्या व्यवसितमर्थं पुरुषश्चेतयति, बुद्धेश्च सर्वो विषयो ज्ञातश्चाज्ञातश्च पुरुषस्यापि समानः।ज्ञाताज्ञातविषयत्वं बुद्ध्या व्यवसितार्थोपलम्भित्वात्।तस्मात् पुरुषस्यापि परिणामित्वं ज्ञाताज्ञातविषयत्वाद्बुद्धिवदेव ॥

 नैष दोषः।बुद्धेरेव पुरुषविषयत्वात्।बुद्धिरेव हि बाह्यार्थाकारा पुरुषस्य विषयो नार्थः केवलः स्वरूपेण।तस्मान्न ज्ञाताज्ञातविषयः पुरुषः।बुद्धिस्तु सदैव ज्ञातैवेति न परिणामित्वं पुरुषस्य ॥

  Objection—But then, the object determined by the intellect is what puruṣa observes; and for the intellect all objects are (sometimes) known and (sometimes) unknown; so it is the same for puruṣa; as that object of the nature of the known or unknown object, determined by intelligence, is acquired (by puruṣa). Therefore there is change in puruṣa as well, due to known and unknown objects similar to the intelligence.

 Answer—There is no defect in this; as it is the intellect (intelligence) itself which is the object of puruṣa. The intelligence taking on the form of the outside object is the object of puruṣa and not the object in its own self. Therefore, puruṣa does not have the object known and unknown. Since the intelligence is at all times known there is no change of puruṣa.

 Objection—But then,the object determined by the intellect is what puruṣa perceives—that is what some say. How is that possible?

 Answer—That is not so; the immutability of puruṣa is accepted by them as well.



The meaning of ‘the object determined by the intellect’ means that (puruṣa) perceives the form taken by the intellect, i.e., perceives the object which is the form attained by the activity of the intellect. Otherwise the qualities of the intelligence like mutability, serving the purpose of another, coming together for serving another’s purpose, etc., will all be connected (to puruṣa).

 Question—But if it is said that knowledge is incompatible with immutability then (the answer is)—not so; since knowledge itself is the nature of puruṣa. He who considers the mutability of puruṣa should be asked thus—what is achieved by change? If he answers— knowledge—then he should be replied back (as follows)—‘the nature of puruṣa is knowledge (consciousness);therefore mutability is without any meaning.’

 If he again says knowledge (of objects) is not experience of puruṣa; why is that so, since experience is modification. Then he has to be answered (as follows)—Even then having modification leads to non-permanence like the body, etc.

 Question—If he again says modification in oneself cannot be a cause for non-permanence but only that modification which leads to a change of state is a cause for non-permanence; then he has to be answered again (as follows)—the state of modification is itself a change of state. When there is modification in that substance which was earlier without modification, that is a change of state.

 Moreover—In the acquisition of an object there is modification; it is not possible to overcome that rule. Also it is not as if those objects like diamonds, emeralds, etc., which have modification in themselves are not impermanent. It is not as if there is a rule that only that knowledge created by modification has an object seen and not the eternal consciousness.

 If it is said that only modification is knowledge and not that created by modification then the answer is—it is not so; then there will be the inconsistency of the body, etc.,which are possessed of modification (activity), having knowledge[^1021] undergoes change when there is knowledge.").

[^1021]: "It appears that this entire section is directed against the Naiyāyika in whose theory ātman (puruṣa

 Therefore, it is established that puruṣa is of the nature of bare consciousness and also without change, due to (having its) object known at all times. Though it has the nature of having consciousness eternally (at all times), this denotation (statement) as



‘he sees’, ‘(he) causes one to see’ and ‘he (saw)’ is created by the presence or absence of the idea (modification) of the intelligence which is known.It is similar to the denotation (statement) of the illumination of the sun, etc., as ‘the sun causes to shine’, ‘the sun will cause illumination’ (and) ‘the sun illuminated’ which is due to the presence or absence of the object illuminated. The marks are purity, etc., and the dissimilar examples are intelligence, etc.

  Now he (mentions) the dissimilarity (through) the words—“sarvār...buddhiḥ”, i.e., since all objects are reduced to being violent, tranquil, etc., (intelligence is composed of the three guṇas) as in the case of the sense organ ear, etc. “guṇānām tūpadraṣṭā” i.e., the reason (given) is because he knows the guṇas by proximity. “atriguṇah puruṣa[^1022]”i.e., the conclusion is that (puruṣa is not composed of the three guṇas). The intelligence, etc., are examples of a dissimilar kind[^1023]and not being composed of the three guṇas he is dissimilar (to intelligence).

[^1022]: " The word “atriguṇaḥ” does not occur in the bhāṣya but the Vivaraṇakāra introduces it as an adjective to puruṣa."

[^1023]: " vipakṣa dṛṣtānta."

“astu....rūpa” = (then he is) indeed (dissimilar) then it follows that being totally dissimilar, experience is inconsistent (in puruṣa). It is said in answer—“nā ...virūpaḥ” ( he is not dissimilar). “kasmāt” = what is the reason for that? Of that pure (puruṣa) which is different from the nature of intelligence there is no reason which establishes it as totally similar to the impure modification of the mind. This is the general idea. That is not so. “yataḥ.... paśyati[^1024]” = as it is established that (puruṣa) is witness to the buddhi-idea; thus it is proved that there is the accompanying knowledge of the buddhi- idea. “anupaśyati” = when there is the change into the form of the object (puruṣa) becomes aware of the buddhi-idea.

[^1024]: "Here again the order of words and phrases in the bhāṣya are juggled around in the Vivaraṇa."

“tamanu[^1025]...”(though perceiving the idea of buddhi) (puruṣa) is not of the nature of the three guṇas. “tadātmaka....sate” = (he appears to be) having activity like being tranquil, violent or deluded. Therefore (puruṣa) is not totally dissimilar due to similarity with the modification of the mind. In that context it was said “Puruṣa is conscious by reflection which will beexplained later[^1026]”,that has been fulfilledhere[^1027]. Thus its similarity (with the modification of the mind) has been pointed out. In the discipline (yoga) itself it is said “apari....ākhyāyate[^692]”,i.e., the power of awareness as already described, (is without movement but appears to have activity) in the modification of the mind (intellect) due to having (knowledge of the object). “tadvrtti[^1029] ...”it appears to resemble the modification of the intellect by having perception. In the process of giving rise to knowledge which is a modification of the mind itself, it attains the status of an object of the power of consciousness. The power of experience attaining that (modification as object) “tasyā....pāyāḥ” = the modification of the intellect has taken on a form resembling consciousness, i.e., resemblance of form to puruṣa; it is like a ball of red hot iron taking on the form of the fire due to being the object of consciousness itself just by “anukāramātratayā” = resembling the modification of the mind (intellect). “buddhi....khyāyate[^1030]”

[^692]: "This is attributed to Pañcaśikhācārya."

[^1025]: "“api” is not connected to “anupaśyan” in the bhāṣya but the Vivaraṇakāra takes it so."

[^1026]: "Bhāṣya under YS, I.7."

[^1027]: "In other words this is the fulfilment of that statement in the first pāda."

[^1029]: "Instead of “anupatati” the Vivaraṇakāra has “anupatanti”."

[^1030]: "Instead of “jñānavṛttiḥ” the Vivaraṇakāra has “jñāvṛttiḥ”. There is too much of repetition of the same idea and the style is heavy."

तदर्थ एव दृश्यस्यात्मा ॥२१॥

  The essence of the (knowable) is only for the sake of it (puruṣa).



दृशिरूपस्य पुरुषस्य कर्मरूपतामापन्नं दृश्यमिति तदर्थ एव दृश्यस्यात्मा भवति स्वरूपं भवतीत्यर्थः ।(ततश्च) स्वरूपं तु पररूपेण प्रतिलब्धात्मकं भोगापवर्गार्थतायां कृतायां पुरुषेण न दृश्यत इति ॥२१॥

 The seen appears as the object of experience of puruṣa who is of the essence of consciousness; therefore the essence of the seen is only for the sake of puruṣa. Its nature, however, depending for its existence on another, ceases to be seen by purusa, once experience and liberation have been achieved.

*tadartha eva dṛśyasyātmā*. By the word tad one recalls the seer, the pure, of the nature of consciousness alone, ātman as it is described[^1031]. *tadarthaḥ* = for his sake, *tadartha* for his purpose, i.e., having the purpose of accomplishing the object of the seer; i.e., in the form of experience and in the form of liberation.

[^1031]: "Described already in YS, II.20."

 In answer to the question as to what that is he says *dṛśyasyātmā* = the essence of pradhāna, its very nature, its own self.

 Objection—But then, the fourfold division has to be explained; so why is there this deviation from the topic in hand[^1032].

[^1032]: "Fourfold nature of pain."

 Answer—There is no defect, as the purpose of absolute cessation of pain is relevant.

 Question—In what way can there be cessation of pain absolutely by ascertaining (the nature of) the object and its serving the purpose of (puruṣa).       

 Answer—Thus he says if the attainment of the essence of the object is for the sake of puruṣa then when all objects serving its (puruṣa’s) needs having accomplished their purpose, there being no other purpose to serve, there will result a total absence of objects; and there will be an absence of any purpose for the object to come into existence again. That which has been accomplished is not again to be accomplished.

  When the object’s own nature would serve its own purpose, then, as there is the presence of one's own purpose it will come into being again and again. And so there will not be total cessation of the object[^1033].Therefore, one has to understand that it is for the sake of it (puruṣa).

[^1033]: "Then there will not be any liberation."

 The object’s serving the purpose of puruṣa and the absence of serving its own end is due to the object being experienced; it is established as it is similar to (objects like) cooked rice, etc., being insentient it also serves another in combination with other objects. Thus he says *“dṛśi[^1001]*...[^1001]*dṛśyamiti[^1001]”*. The word “iti” is used in the sense of a cause. “tadartha... rthaḥ" = the purpose of puruṣa is itself the fulfilment of pradhana by accomplishing the object of the seer (puruṣa), just as in the case of cooked rice, etc.[^1037]

[^1001]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything new to the bhāṣya."

 He now explains the purport of the sūtra (though the words) “tataśca[^1038]” and so on. As serving the purpose is fixed “puruṣa...tmakam[^1039]” = taking on the form of consciousness by reflection “sad...dṛśyate[^1040]” = (it is not seen by puruṣa once its purpose is achieved) as there is no other object to be achieved other than experience and liberation.

[^1037]: "As in the enjoyment of food which is also one form of pradhāna so are the other experiences as well."

[^1038]: "This is not found in available bhāṣya readings."

[^1039]: "The bhāṣya reading has “pararūpeṇa” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “puruṣarūpeṇa”."

[^1040]: "The Vivaraṇakāra adds “sad” to “bhogāpavargārthatāyām” in the bhāṣya."



**  ** स्वरूपहानादस्य नाशः प्राप्तः।न तु विनश्यति।कस्मात् ?

  Then because of losing its real nature (it appears as if) it is destroyed. But it is not destroyed. Why (is it not destroyed) ?

**कृतार्थं प्रति नष्टमप्यनष्टं तदन्यसाधारणत्वात् ॥२२॥**

  Though it has ceased to be so far as the puruṣa who has attained his end is concerned, it has still not ceased to be as it is common to other (puruṣas).

कृतार्थमेकं पुरुषं प्रति दृश्यं नष्टमपि नाशं प्राप्तमप्यनष्टं तदन्यपुरुषसाधारणत्वात्।कुशलं पुरुषं प्रति नाशं प्राप्तमप्यकुशलान्पुरुषान्प्रति न कृतार्थमिति तेषां दृशेः कर्मविषयतामापन्नं लभत एव पररूपेणात्मरूपमिति।अतश्च दृग्दर्शनशक्त्योर्नित्यत्वादनादिः संयोगो व्याख्यात इति।तथा चोक्तम्—धर्मिणामनादिसंयोगाद्धर्ममात्राणामप्यनादिः संयोग इति ॥२२॥

  Though the seen has ceased to exist, i.e., is destroyed, with reference to a puruṣa who has achieved his purpose, it is still not destroyed as it is common to other puruṣas. Though it is destroyed with regard to a puruṣa who has attained wisdom still it has not achieved the purpose with regard to those puruṣas who have not achieved wisdom. Therefore, by appearing as the object of the act of consciousness of those puruṣas, it still exists, depending on another for its existence. Therefore, the power of the seer and the power by which one sees being eternal, their relationship has been explained as being without beginning (in II. 17).In this connection it has been said—Because of the beginningless association of the substances (with puruṣa) there is beginningless association between the qualities (objects) (and puruṣa).'

  सूत्रसम्बन्धं करोति—यं पुरुषं प्रति चरितार्थं दृश्यं तं प्रति दृशिकर्मतां नापत्स्यत इति स्वरूपहानम्, अतश्च स्वरूपहानादस्य विनाशः प्राप्तः।न तु विनश्यति सर्वात्मना।कस्मात् ? को हेतुः ? प्रधानानां प्रतिपुरुषं बहुत्वात् कृतार्थं प्रति नष्टमेवेति मन्यते ॥

  He mentions the relevance of the (next) sūtra as follows—that puruṣa with reference to whom the seen has fulfilled is purpose, does not acquire the function of the seen (object) with reference to that (puruṣa), therefore that is destruction of its true nature and thus “svarūpa...ptaḥ” (there is destruction due to loss of its real nature). But “na...śyati" (it is not destroyed in a total sense). “kasmāt” = Due to what reason (is it so). As pradhāna is multiple with reference to each purușa it is destroyed with reference to (the puruṣa) whose purpose (goal) has been achieved—this is the idea.

* kṛtārtham...tvāt*. “kṛtārtham” = that which has served its purpose by accomplishing experience and liberation with reference to a specific puruṣa, “tam...prati[^1041]”= (with reference to that puruṣa) it does not function again as instrument and effect due to non-distinction between existence and non-existence[^1042]; “naṣṭamapi” = this is

[^1041]: "The bhāṣya does not have “tam” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra adds it to “ekam” and reads it as “tamekam”."

[^1042]: "Once liberation is achieved these distinctions are no more valid."



explained as “[nāśa....api](http://॑ "Instead of “nāśam prāptamapi” in the bhāṣya the Vivaraṇakāra has “nāśaprāptamapi”.")”. “anaṣṭam....tvāt”, i.e., with reference to those (puruṣas) whose purpose has not been accomplished, with reference to them it is not destroyed.

  He describes why it is not destroyed (through the words) “[kuśala....ptam](http://॑॑# "The Vivaraṇakāra has “kuśalapuruṣān prati nāśaprāptam” instead of “kuśalam puruṣam prati nāśam prāptam”.")”,i.e., in the case of one who has attained true wisdom (prajñā) it has fulfilled its purpose by accomplishing experience and liberation. “akuśa....rtham[^1043]",i.e., not accomplishing experience and liberation that have to be accomplished “teṣām drśeḥ” = with reference to the unenlightened ones they are themselves the seer[^1044]. “karma....ātmarupam[^1045]”= due to reflection of puruṣa. Therefore being common to all, pradhāna is one just like earth, etc. As the instruments and effects (of action) are distinct the plurality of puruṣas is proved. So also the distinction between puruṣas is established due to the plurality of pleasure and pain[^1046].

[^1043]: "Instead of “akuśalān puruṣān prati na kṛṭārtham” the Vivaraṇakāra has “akuśalapuruṣān prati akṛṭārtham”."

[^1044]: "By reflection the seer is only experiencing what the intellect presents; therefore experience itself is in a sense the seer."

[^1045]: "Instead of “karma viṣyatāmāpannam labhata eva pararūpeṇātmarūpam” he has “karmatāmāpannam labhata eva puruṣarūpeṇa ātmarūpam”."

[^1046]: "One person can be experiencing pleasure, for instance, while another one is going through pain."

अतश्च दृग्दर्शनशक्त्योर्नित्यत्वादनादिः संयोगो व्याख्यातः।तथा चोक्तं तन्त्रे—धर्मिणामनादिसंयोगात् गुणानां पुरुषाणां चानादिसंयोगाद्धर्ममात्राणां महदादिकार्यकरणान्तानामपि पुरुषैरनादिः संयोगो धर्मिभिर्धर्माणामभिन्नत्वात् ॥२२॥

  Therefore, due to the power of seeing and power of the seer being permanent their connection is explained as being without beginning. Thus it is said in the school “dharmi....saṃyogaḥ”, i.e., due to the beginningless contact between purusas and guṇas there is beginningless connection of the means and effects of action like mahat, etc., with puruṣas as there is an identity (of purpose) between the substances having the qualities and the qualities themselves.

  संयोगस्वरूपाभिधित्सयेदं सूत्रं प्रववृते—

  With the desire to define the nature of association this sūtra is begun:

**स्वस्वामिशक्त्योः स्वरूपोपलब्धिहेतुः संयोगः ॥२३॥**

 Association is the means of knowing the true nature of the powers of the possessor (owner) and the possessed (owned).



 **** पुरुषः स्वामी दृश्येन स्वेन दर्शनार्थं संयुक्तः।तस्मात्संयोगाद् दृश्यस्योपलब्धिर्या स भोगः, या तु द्रष्टुः स्वरूपोपलब्धिः, सोऽपवर्गः।दर्शनकार्यावसानः संयोग इति दर्शनं वियोगस्य कारणमुक्तम्।दर्शनमदर्शनस्य प्रतिद्वन्द्वीत्यदर्शनं संयोगनिमित्तमुक्तम्।नात्र दर्शनं मोक्षकारणम्,अदर्शनाभावादेव बन्धाभावः स मोक्ष इति।दर्शनस्य भावे बन्धकारणस्यादर्शनस्य नाश इत्यतो दर्शनं ज्ञानं कैवल्यकारणमुक्तम् ।

  Puruṣa the owner, is associated with the owned which is fit to be known for the sake of knowledge. The cognition of the object which takes place by that association is experience. Whereas the cognition of the true nature of the seer (puruṣa) is liberation. Conjunction ends when (true) knowledge results; therefore (true) knowledge is mentioned as the cause for disassociation.

 (True) knowledge is the opposite of misapprehension; therefore misapprehension is mentioned as the cause of association. (True) knowledge here, is not the cause for liberation (directly). It is only due to the absence of misapprehension that there is absence of bondage, which is liberation. Where there is (true) knowledge there is destruction of misapprehension which is the cause of bondage; therefore true knowledge is mentioned as the cause for liberation.

 **** किं चेदमदर्शनं नाम ?

  Now what is this misapprehension ? (a) Is it the sway of the guṇas ? (b) Or is it the non-production of the primary mind which has presented experiences and true knowledge to the owner (puruṣa) of the form of the knower ?, i.e., the absence of knowledge, when the knowable object is present in it? (c) Or is it the purposefulness of the guṇas? (d) Or is avidyā which is restrained along with one's own mind the basis of the rise of one's own mind ? (e) Or is it the manifestaion of the latent impression of motion when the latent impression of equilibrium has exhausted itself? In this connection it has been said that if pradhāna exists only in a state of equilibrium then, since it is not a cause for change (production), it will be apradhāna. Similarly, if it exists only in motion then due to the evolutes (production) being permanent it will be apradhāna. When it has both the functions, it gains the status of pradhāna and not otherwise. Even with regard to other imagined causes the same reasoning applies.

८—दर्शनंज्ञानमेवादर्शनमिति केचिदभिदधति।इत्येते शास्त्रगता विकल्पाः।तत्र विकल्पबहुत्वमेतत् ॥२३॥

 (f) Some say that the power of knowledge is itself misapprehension (adarśanam). According to the scriptures, ‘The activity of pradhāna is in order to reveal itself.’Puruṣa which is capable of knowing anything fit to be known, does not cognise the knowable which is capable of causing all effects, before activity sets in; i.e., it is not known at that time. (g) According to some, ‘adarśana’ is the characteristic of both (the knower and the known). In this connection this (adarśana) though belonging to the nature of the known, appears to be the characteristic of the object through the dependence of knowledge on the reflection of puruṣa. Similarly ‘adarśanam’ though not belonging to the nature of the self appears to be a characteristic of the puruṣa by its dependence on the knowledge of the intellect (object). (h) According to some, knowledge which is apprehension (of objects) is itself ‘adarśanam’. These are various opinions given in the śāstras. Thus all these are various opinions.

 दृश्यमवधृतम्।द्रष्टा चावधृतः।द्रष्टृदृश्ययोः संयोगो हेयहेतुरिति चोक्तम्।स च संयोगोऽवधारयितव्यः कीदृशं इति।ततश्च संयोगस्वरूपावधारणार्थमिदं सूत्रं प्रववृत्ते—स्वस्वामिशक्त्योः स्वरूपोपलब्धिहेतुः संयोगः।स्वस्वामिशक्त्योः बुद्धिपुरुषयोः स्वरूपोपलब्धेर्हेतुः कारणम्।यस्मिन् सति तयोः स्वरूपमुपलभ्यते वदनदर्पणयोरिव,स तयोः स्वरूपोपलब्धिहेतुः।संयोगः दृष्टृदृश्यस्वरूपकार्यानुमेय इत्यर्थः ॥

  The nature of the seen (object) has been discussed[^1047].So also has (the nature of the) seer been discussed[^918].It has also been mentioned that the association between the seer and the seen which is the cause (for bondage) is to be destroyed[^1049].(Now) that association is to be determined as to its (real) nature. Therefore, in order to determine the true nature of association this sūtra is begun—*svasvāmi ...yogaḥ, svasvāmiśaktyoḥ* = with reference to the intellect and the puruṣa, *svarū....yogaḥ*[^1050], i.e., the cause (to gain knowledge of their true nature).

[^918]: "YS, II.20."

[^1047]: "YS, II.18."

[^1049]: " YS, II.17."

[^1050]: "Instead of svarūpopalabdhihetuḥ the Vivaraṇakāra splits it and has svarūpopalabdherhetuḥ."

 In the presence of which one gets to know their true nature, as for instance the face and a mirror, that is the means for knowing the true nature of both, *saṃyogaḥ*, i.e., it is inferred from the effect of the nature of the seer and the seen.

  The testimony in this case is that the knowledge of the true nature of the intellect and puruṣa is preceded by contact with what is possessed (the object), as there is awareness of the true nature of the object and the subject (one possessing the object), as in the case of awareness of the nature of the mirror and seeing the sight (of oneselfin the mirror). Any awareness of pleasure or pain got through contradictory objects[^1051]is preceded by the contact of that which causes pleasure or pain due to the awareness of pleasure or pain, as in the case of awareness of pain or pleasure when in contact with a thorn or with sandal paste. 

[^1051]: "There are objects of a contradictory nature in the world, some bringing pleasure and some bringing pain to the one who comes into touch with them."



 तदाह—पुरुषः स्वामी दृश्येन स्वेन स्वया बुद्ध्या दर्शनार्थं भोगापवर्गदर्शनार्थं संयुक्तः।दर्शनप्रयुक्त एव संयोग इत्यर्थः ॥

तस्मात् संयोगाद्दर्शनप्रयुक्ता दृश्यस्योपलब्धिः अविशिष्टा या स भोगः।या तु द्रष्टुः स्वरूपोपलब्धिर्विविक्ता सोऽपवर्गः।यस्माद्दर्शनकार्यद्वयप्रयुक्तः संयोगस्तस्माद्दर्शनकार्यावसानः संयोगः तेन पुरुषसंयोगवद्दर्शनं वियोगस्य कारणमित्युक्तम्।गुणपुरुषान्तरदर्शनं प्रधानपुरुषवियोगस्य कारणमित्युक्तं,कार्यस्य दर्शनेन पर्यवसितत्वात्॥

 संसारिसंसारहेतुयाथात्म्यदर्शनं दुःखदुःखिसंयोगहेतुनिवर्तकं,दुःखिदुःखहेतुयाथात्म्यविषयत्वात्,रोगिरोगहेतुयाथात्म्यदर्शनवत्॥

  Thus he says “puruṣa...yuktaḥ”, i.e. (puruṣa) (is associated) with its own intellect for the sake of awareness of experience and liberation. It means that association is awareness (used for the sense of awareness). “tasmāt...pavargaḥ”, i.e., the awareness which is identical (with the awareness of the object of experience) and distinguished from that (which is the awareness of the nature of the seer is liberation). Since contact accomplishes this twofold awareness therefore “darśana...yogaḥ” (association ends when true insight results); so, similar to contact with puruṣa “darśanam...ktam[^1052]” = the knowledge of the distinction between the gunas and puruṣa is the cause for the disassociation of puruṣa and pradhāna; because the end is achieved through insight.  
  The insight of the truth regarding the cause of the world and one who possesses (lives in) the world is the remover of the cause of the association between pain and the possessor of pain, as its object is the truth concerning the cause of pain and one possessing pain[^1053]. This is similar to the knowledge of the truth concerning the cause of disease and the one possessing the disease

[^1052]: "There is no “iti” in the bhāṣya whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “kāraṇamityuktam”."

[^1053]: "Eventually it boils down to the individual suffering pain and the search for its removal. This is a rather unelevating position to take. Nowhere is the end depicted as in anywhere resembling the freedom that comes with liberation."

  Ignorance is the cause of the association between the seer and the seen, because of contact causing pain; it is similar to ignorance being the cause for contact with what causes disease[^1054]. The association of the seer and the seen is preceded by ignorance, as

[^1054]: " This whole section is so simplistic and has none of the sophistication of style that one is used to with Śaṅkara. The Vivaraṇakāra repeats the same idea so many times—it appears he is not confident enough to leave a point having stated it once."



it causes pain like contact between the cause of ill health and the possessor of ill health. Because “darśanam” = (insight) has its object as the truth concerning the cause of pain and one possessing pain, therefore “[adarśanasya...ktam](http://॑# "While the bhāṣya has “darśanam adarśanasya pratidvandvītyadarśanam saṃyoganimittamuktam” the Vivaraṇakāra has “darśanamadarśanasya pratidvandvamityadarśanam saṃyoganimittamityuktam”.")” = (it is mentioned as the opposer of ignorance); (ignorance) has its object different from that; also because association (of the seer and seen) is the cause for pain.

 Because awareness removes ignorance[^1055]and does not do any other work, therefore “nātra...bhāvādeva”, i.e., (awareness is not the cause for liberation); “bandha[^1056]

[^1055]: " The direct cause of liberation is absence of bondage and not awareness which is indirect."

...mokṣaḥ[^1056]” (having the absence of bondage which is the cause of pain is liberation), i.e., one should not look upon liberation as different from the absence of bondage. And then it follows that liberation is permanent[^1058].

[^1056]: " Instead of “bandhābhāvaḥ” the Vivaraṇakāra has “bandhasyābhāvaḥ”."

[^1058]: " Bondage is the cause of pain and once that is removed by correct vision liberation results. Thus it is a permanent state requiring correct insight."

 “darśanasya...nāśaḥ”, i.e., in the presence of insight of the nature of the seer and seen (there is destruction of ignorance) as its object; this is because there is an opposition between true insight and ignorance co-existing in the same locus (at the same time) which is similar to darkness and collection of scattered rays of light of the sun (being opposed to each other). “ato...ktam[^1059]”*viveka... pāyaḥ*[^1060] is continuous insight.").

[^1059]: " The Vivaraṇakāra does not explain this."

[^1060]: "YS, II.26. The means of removal (of ignorance

  Objection—But then, has it not been mentioned that (adarśanam—lack of vision) is ignorance itself; and that is “amitragoṣpadavat[^1061]” explained as the opposite of knowledge, (like “amitra...”).

[^1061]: " Bhāṣya under YS, II.5."

 Answer—That is true but the options in the various śāstras are pointed out with the intent of ascertainment of one's own desired end. It is only in the wake of defeating the views of others can one strengthen greatly the view that one has ascertained, as one's own preferred theory.

 The words “kiṃcedam” (what is this adarśanam)” is to be connected with all the options that are to be mentioned. “kim...dhikāra”, i.e., what has been questioned in a general sense is now being connected with special meanings. “adhikāra” is rightful duty (and) is the activity of the “guṇānām” (guṇas)

 किमर्थवत्ता गुणानां भोगापवर्गाभ्यां या गुणानामर्थवत्ता तददर्शनमिति।अत्र त्वर्थद्वारेणैवाशङ्का।प्रयोजनवतो हि प्रयोजनमवश्यकृत्यमिति ॥

 Objection—But then, how can there be the suggestion of ignorance with regard to the activity of the guṇas?

 Answer—It is through the meaning of the word[^1062] ‘as long as there is guṇa activity there is bondage’, ( 2 ) ‘The cause of bondage is ignorance.’ Then by combining (1) & (2) we reach the conclusion that guṇa activity = ignorance = adarśanam.") that ignorance (comes to mean) activity. Till such time as the guṇas have activity there is bondage. (Then) by saying that the cause for bondage is ignorance, there is brought in stability of meaning. Even through words when (it is said) that ignorance is different from insight there is bound to arise the uncertainty that activity of the gunas indeed is different from insight[^1063].

[^1062]: "The word ‘avidyā’ has to be analysed and the meaning arrived at. Thus (1

[^1063]: " Since the different meanings can lead one to expect this conclusion."


“āhosvit...tpādaḥ[^1064]”.In this context, accepting the importance of the meaning of the first part in the compound adarśanam, the question is raised. (Is) “cittasyānutpādaḥ” = it the non-arising of insight before its coming into being. He explains further what has been expressed as non-arising (through the words) “svasmin...bhāvaḥ[^1065]”,i.e, adarśanam is the non-arising of insight of difference between the guṇas and puruṣa.

[^1064]: "The Vivaraṇakāra leaves out “pradhāna” from “pradhānacittasyānutpādaḥ”."

[^1065]: " Again the Vivaraṇakāra adds “citte” to the bhāṣya and quotes it as “ . . . dṛśye citte vidyamāne ...”."

 “kim...nām”, i.e., adarśanam is the purposefulness of the guṇas which comes through experience and liberation. Here the uncertainty is due to the end in view. With regard to one having a purpose in view, the purpose is to be certainly fulfilled[^1066].

[^1066]: " It is not the meaning which is stressed but the purpose served by adarśanam."

 Question—What is the defect in all the above views?

 Answer—If one takes adarśanam to mean the activity of the guṇas then right knowledge will prove futile. In this view right knowledge cannot be in opposition to activity. Since knowledge and activity are not opposed to each other there will be the contingency of lack of liberation, for, due to (the guṇas) having a purpose there will be activity repeatedly.

 The view that lack of insight is the purposefulness of the guṇas also suffers from this (above-mentioned) defect. In the view of the non-arising of the mind (pradhāna) also it (the defect) is the [same](http://॑# "There is not much difference between the second and the third options as far as the continuous activity of the gunas are concerned. Therefore both these views suffer from the same defect as the first option."). Non-arising is the absence of insight and that not being a substance cannot be destroyed through knowledge; since it is an absence it is useless to plan its opposition.


“athāvidyā...ddheti[^1067]”;herein he distinguishes between avidyā and adarśanam, thinking that they are connected in parts[^1068].How does he do it? When ignorance is not restricted, then being fit to be seen, it is indeed seeing, (insight). Whereas that which is “niruddha”, absorbed in its cause along with the mind, “svacitta...jam” = that is the seed for coming into being (again); that is not seen[^1069] therefore it is considered as adarśanam (not seen). And hence, as there will be the inconsistency of insight in the unrestricted stage this view suffers from that defect[^1070]. But if it is understood that both the restricted and unrestricted stages have lack of insight then there is no defect, as that is the desired view[^1071].

[^1067]: " The bhāṣya says “niruddha” while the Vivaraṇakāra adds “iti” to it."

[^1068]: " It is interesting to see the use of the word ‘meda’ for mixing up. ‘Meda’ denotes a mixed caste and so there is no clear-cut boundaries. Avidyā and adarśanam present such a problem."

[^1069]: " When it is absorbed in prakṛti."

[^1070]: "After death, before another life, avidyā lies in prakṛti along with the subtle mind, and it is not seen as being the seed for the next life. But this is not restraint of avidyā or the mind therefore by confusing the meanings it will appear that avidyā or adarśanam can give rise to liberation which is a defect."

[^1071]: "Nirodha here meaning the stage before coming into being again and anirodha meaning the existence before absorption in prakṛti."

 “kim...vyaktiḥ” (In this case) the line “kim...nam[^1072]”(is this adarśanam) is not applied (connected).

[^1072]: " The bhāṣya has “kim cedam” which the Vivaraṇakāra quotes as “kimetad”."

 Question—What is the connection?

 Answer—He says therein (earlier) avidyā was described as restricted along with the mind, being the seed for the commencement of the mind, and from that meaning the following is derived, i.e., the mind is restrained in its own cause and comes into being again. From that meaning it also follows that the cause of the mind also exists both steadily (in equilibrium) and in motion. From that statement this (present) question is asked for the sake of clarity.

 “sthitisaṃskāraḥ”, i.e, the meaning of the word “sthiti” is the saṃskāras which are the cause for the state of equilibrium of the [guṇas,](http://॑# "There is motion even here except that prakṛti reproduces itself and there is no differentiation into the various evolutes.")and means equilibrium. When that is exhausted = “sthiti...ye”, there is “gatiḥ” = activity in the form of mahat,etc.,the saṃskāra for that purpose is “gati...raḥ” i.e., there is its manifestation.

 If it exists either in motion or in equilibrium then what is the defect—he indicates that through example as “yatre...syāt”, i.e., (if it exists) without change into the form of mahat, etc., (only in equilibrium) (then it will not be pradhāna). The meaning of the word pradhāna is that which exhibits (brings about) changes. Therefore, since it does not exhibit (bring about) changes (mutations), it will be apradhāna.

 “tathā...tvād”, i.e., if it stays permanently undergoing mutation, then, as it does not bring about (bestow) any changes[^1073] there is destruction of its causality, and thus (it will be apradhāna).

[^1073]: "There is no need to bring about any mutation as mutation is the permanent state in this option."

 “ubhayathā vṛttiḥ”,i.e., that existence of pradhāna whose functions are both activity and equlibrium “ubha...labhate[^1074]” gains the function of causality; “nānyathā” (in no other way) does pradhāna have the characteristic of being pradhāna. “kārana...carcaḥ” (with reference to other causes also) such as puruṣa, īśvara, minutest atoms, etc., (imagined by others) the reasoning is similar in content[^1075]. Right now we are discussing what is relevant (to the topic).

[^1074]: "Instead of “ubhayathā cāsya vṛttiḥ pradhānavyavahāram labhate” the Vivaraṇakāra has “ubhayathā vṛtti vyavahāram pradhānatvavyavahāram labhate”."

[^1075]: " The examples of puruṣa īśvara and atoms seem to cover the well-known theories of ultimate causes. But the advaita Brahman is not even mentioned."

 “darśana...ke”, i.e., the state of not being manifested (as yet) like the seed being the unmanifested state of a sprout—that is (adarśanam)—so say some “manyante[^1076]”.Why is that so? “pradhāna...śruteḥ”,i.e., revealing is darśanam which is of the

[^1076]: "This is not found in the bhāṣya but the Vivaraṇakāra has it after “eke”."



nature of revealing itself to it; and not seeing that is adarśanam according to scrip[tures](http://॑# " Not recognising the potentiality to be known is what adarśanam is, according to this view."). In this view, that itself is adarśanam which is unmanifested and is in a potential form (form of power) and when that is manifested it is seeing (darśanam); since, in oneself, there cannot be a contradiction, there is no possibility of cessation of adarśanam (not seeing) through right vision (in itself[^1077]).

[^1077]: " Thus while adarśanam refers to pradhāna, darśanam refers to puruṣa, and their coexistence in one locus is not there."

 Similarly there is another view. “sarva...paśyati[^1078]”,i.e., (puruṣa) being of the nature of consciousness or even though puruṣa is of the nature of right vision, (he) does not see (prior) to the activity of prakṛti. “sarva ...dṛśyate”, i.e., pradhāna (capable) of activity, though existing in truth, (is not known) prior to activity; therefore (adarśanam) is the property of both pradhāna and puruṣa say some. In this view also it is in the prior state that there is lack of vision in both (puruṣa and pradhāna) whereas in the later stage there is vision—thus the earlier defect is present in this also.

[^1078]: "The Vivaraṇakāra combines “sarva . . . dṛśyate” with “ubhaya . . . eke” and presents this as the next view. Here he also adds “manyante” to “eke” which is not there in the bhāṣya. Similarly instead of “sarvabodhyabodhasamarthaḥ” he has sarvabodhasamarthaḥ”."

“dṛśyasyātmabhūtam[^1079]”,i.e., even though (the object) is in itself not distinguished (from adarśanam) “puruṣapratyayāpekṣam” = it is not known to puruṣa in the form of puruṣa; or (one can say) that it is known to puruṣa as qualified by the form of (reflection of) puruṣa, thus lack of sight (object) depending on knowledge of puruṣa becomes the qualification of puruṣa[^1080].He clarifies this (further) as follows —“puruṣa...peksam”, i.e, the idea of an object is ignorance and it depends on the object; he explains how knowledge either due to the reflection of puruṣa or due to the contact of ignorance depends on the idea in the mind (through the words) “puruṣa....sate”. In that sense it is the property of the seen (object) alone and so there is no defect.

[^1079]: " “Svātmabhūtam” is “. . . ātmabhūtam” here."

[^1080]: "The seen object is lack of vision and it depends on puruṣa for knowledge of itself. Thus it is viewed as a qualification of purușa though identified with the object."

  All this has been put forward in order to explain all the views regarding this. “darśanam...manyante[^1081]” = (Right vision is knowledge) and that (knowledge it-

[^1081]: " While the bhāṣya has “. . . abhidadhati” the Vivaraṇa has “ . . . manyante”."



self is lack of vision say some)[^1082]. This view is advocated by giving importance to the second part of the compound. The defect in this view is already pointed out in the sūtra dealing with avidyā[^1083].

[^1082]: "While the last option is mentioned here the Vivaraṇakāra has already concluded the section by stating “sarvavikalpa . . . nyāsaḥ”. Thus there is a lack of coherence in style."

[^1083]: "YS, II.5. The defects are obvious and need not been repeated."

 “ete...kalpāḥ” = many are these views including that of knowledge (being ignorance). (Thus there are many views) but many (views) do not accomplish the purpose that is the general idea[^1084].That which causes the contact of the intellect and puruṣa, that is lack of insight (ignorance) which is according to reason, since it is in opposition to knowledge. And that has been explained already and so it is not attempted again (here)[^1085].

[^1084]: "At every stage the defect if any, in each view has been pointed out."

[^1085]: "The fourth option thus is the favoured view."

  सर्वपुरुषाणां गुणसंयोगाविशेषः।असाधारणविषयस्तु प्रत्यक्चेतनस्य स्वबुद्धिसंयोगः—

  All puruṣas have in common contact with the guṇas. That which is special is the  
association of the inner self with its own intelligence.

**तस्य हेतुरविद्या ॥२४॥**

  It has as its cause avidyā.

  (Avidyā) means the subliminal-impressions. Intelligence possessed with the subliminal-impression of misapprehension does not achieve the ultimate (true) knowledge of the self; but having the capacity to produce effects, it again comes back. Whereas, that (intelligence) which achieves the ultimate end of (true) knowledge of the self has fulfilled its function (and) is free from misapprehension. Since (then) there is absence of the cause of bondage it does not come back again.

 In this connection someone ridicules this position by (citing) the anecdote of an impotent husband. He is addressed thus by his simple wife—O my impotent husband, my sister has children, why do I not have children? He tells her—when I am dead I shall beget you a child. Similarly, this knowledge, while existing does not cause the cessation of the mind, then what is the hope that it will cause its cessation in the future? In that connection a sage replies—liberation is indeed only the cessation of the mind. The mind (intelligence) ceases to be in the absence of adarśanam (lack of



true knowledge) which is its cause. That adarśanam which is the cause for bondage, disappears due to true knowledge.

 Then (the conclusion is that) liberation is only the cessation of the modifications of the mind. Therefore why is there this confusion of thought in the objector? It is so much out of place.

  “sarva ...śesah”[^1086],' i.e., the contact with the guṇas is nothing special and is common to all (puruṣas). Still “asādhā ...gaḥ” = that which each ātman (puruṣa) knows as the idea of its intellect is specially qualified by the special contact with its own intellect; that through which (this contact) is brought about is itself adarśanam (lack of insight).

[^1086]: "In available readings the introduction to the sutra is only “yastu prayakcetanasya svabuddhisaṃyogaḥ”; whereas the Vivaraṇa adds the bhāṣya portion under II.23 “sarva puruṣāṇām guṇānām saṃyoge sādhāraṇaviṣayam” also as part of the introduction."

* tasya heturavidyā. tasya* = contact which is the cause for knowledge of the nature of the power of the owner and the owned. *hetuḥ* = has its basis as avidyā, i.e., “viparya...thaḥ”[^1087]

 Objection—But then, it has been said already that *viparyayo ...ṣṭham*[^1088] which does not correspond to its (real) form.").Similarly, it has already been stated that *anitya ...avidyā*[^1089].So how is it that here (avidyā) is described as the latent impressions of misapprehension?

[^1087]: " No explanation is given of this bhāṣya portion by the Vivaraṇakāra."

[^1088]: " YS, I.8. ‘Misapprehension is false knowledge (of a thing

[^1089]: " YS, II.5. ‘Avidyā is the idea of permanence in impermanence . . ."

 Answer—This is not a defect. Since the latent impressions are caused by avidyā (lack of insight) that is itself mentioned as avidyā. Even when all the causes have disappeared (or are absorbed) in a state of equilibrium (of prakṛti) the subliminal-impression of avidyā is the cause for the activity of pradhāna again and again. And there is no misapprehension before the coming into being of intelligence as there is an absence of the cause for activity; the latent impressions of that (avidyā, misapprehension) is the cause for the contact between puruṣa and prakṛti—thus it is mentioned.[^1090]


[^1090]: "It is interesting to note that the Vivaraṇakāra has the same question that Miśra asks and answers it the same way too. This is interesting as it can very well mean that the Vivaraṇakāra had access to Miśra’s commentary."

 He mentions the same thing as [“viparyaya...pnoti”](http://॑# "The Vivaraṇakāra just completes sentences using the bhāṣya text for the most part. He does not provide full explanations as other commentators do."),i.e., the ultimate end (is not achieved when under the influence of avidyā-vāsanā). The ultimate end is mentioned as “puruṣakhyātim”; that (is not achieved by intelligence). That which ends in the true knowledge of the self is the capacity of intelligence to accomplish its purpose. “sādhikāra” having this capacity to produce effects “punaḥ...tate” = (it comes back again and again) due to the subliminal-impressions of misapprehension.

 “sā tu...pnoti”—he clarifies the same idea again as “caritā . . .” and so on. As karma and its result (vipāka) have lack of insight as its basis, it is said that lack of insight is itself a bondage. When adarśanam ceases to be then, as there is cessation of bondage, “bandha...vartate” when there is absence of adarśanam which is the cause of bondage (there is no more rebirth).


“atra...dghaṭṭayati”[^1091].“paṇḍaka” = an eunuch. He is (asked by) “mugdhayā bhāryayā” = (his simple wife). What (does she ask him)? “ārya...apatyavatyasmīti”[^1092].“tāmāha...pratyāśca”[^1093]. The intention of the narrator is as follows—if avidyā is the cause for the contact of the intelligence and puruṣa and the cause for its cessation is knowledge, then when knowledge is present its contradictory, lack of knowledge, ceases to be. There can be no cessation of the mind[^1094] even after the rise of knowledge; therein, just as there is no cessation of the mind when knowledge comes into being so also, even when knowledge ceases to be it will not turn it back from the shore; it is

[^1091]: "Instead of “udghāṭayati” in the bhāṣya the Vivaraṇakāra has “udghaṭṭayati”."

[^1092]: "The sentence ends with “nāma nāham” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “nāham apatyavatyasmi”."

[^1093]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not even attempt to explain this portion and leaves the bhāṣya to do the job. The bhāṣya begins with “sa” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra starts the sentence with “tam”. Again in place of “vinaṣṭam” the Vivaraṇakāra has “naśṭam”."

[^1094]: "This is a doubt as to why the mind does not cease to be when knowledge comes into being. In fact this is a confusion which is explained later."



similar to the production of children from a dead eunuch. That is the reason why avidyā is also not the cause of contact[^1095].

[^1095]: "The bhāṣya has “tatrā . . .” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “atrā . . .”."

 “atra... vakti”[^1096]= ( In this context the sage mentions) the remedy (for the confusion).

[^1096]: "The affix ‘deśīya’ is used normally to denote the sense of ‘about’ or ‘somewhat like’. Thus ācāryadeśīya would denote ‘one like a preceptor’ and not a ‘preceptor’ himself. The opponent’s view not being something difficult or important even one who is ‘like a preceptor’ can solve it."

 The mention of ‘one equal to a preceptor’ is in order to indicate the unimportance of the opponent’s view, i.e., by opening (explaining) (the statement) I shall reply (to your question).

 “nanu... mokṣaḥ”[^1001](liberation is cessation of mind). How is that. “adarśanam... mokṣaḥ”.[^1098]

[^1001]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything new to the bhāṣya."

 “kimartham... bhramaḥ”, i.e., pain caused by contact between puruṣa and pradhāna is due to avidyā—this has been explained in great detail. Therefore, since it is proper that there should be cessation of ignorance by the rise of insight it is felt that the opposition is inconsequential.

[^1098]: "The Vivaraṇakāra just repeats the bhāṣya and leaves it as such. Therefore it has not been translated again. Whereas the bhāsya has “tatra cittanivṛttireva mokṣaḥ” the Vivaraṇa has “tannivṛttireva mokṣaḥ”."

 Objection—But then, it has also been mentioned that the mind (intelligence) does not cease right after the rise of insight.

 Answer—It is said that due to the rise of insight, ignorance ceases to exist. One should not have any doubt about that. When that ceases the cessation of the mind also takes place, as there is the absence of another cause apart from ignorance (avidyā) for the contact of the mind (with puruṣa). Therefore liberation is indeed the cessation of the (modification of the) mind.

 Mention of the mind not ceasing right after the rise of insight is without a cause[^1099]. Why is that so? One sees that there are many kinds of causes and effects. Thus houses, etc., which have causes like carpenters, etc., do not cease to exist when their causes cease to exist like when the carpenters, etc., cease to exist. When a tree is broken one does not notice the difference immediately after the breaking. Similarly the mind

[^1099]: "At this point there is no avidyā supporting the mind. It is there till it merges with its cause."



also, like a released arrow, because of the subliminal-impressions that have started its result not being exhausted, stays for some time because of those subliminal-impressions due to the insight itself. There is the following scriptural statement (in this context)—‘And for him only so long is the delay(as he is not liberated from[the body—)’.](http://॑# "Chānd. Up., 6.14.2.")

**** हेयं दुःखम्।हेयकारणं च संयोगाख्यं सनिमित्तमुक्तम्।अतः परं हानं वक्तव्यम्—

 The avoidable pain (has been mentioned). So also the cause for the avoidable pain,called association (between puruṣa and prakṛti), along with the reasons (for it), have been mentioned,Now removal (of association) is to be described.

तदभावात्संयोगाभावो हानं तद्दृशेः कैवल्यम् ॥२५॥

 Removal is the absence of association due to the absence of it (adarśanam); it is the state of liberation of puruṣa.

** **तस्यादर्शनस्याभावाद् बुद्धिपुरुषसंयोगाभावः।आत्यन्तिको बन्धनोपरम इत्यर्थः।एतत् हानम्।तद्दृशेः कैवल्यं, पुरुषस्यामिश्रीभावः पुनरसंयोगो गुणैरित्यर्थः।दुःखकारणनिवृत्तौ दुःखोपरमो हानम्, तदा स्वरूपप्रतिष्ठः पुरुष इत्युक्तम् ॥२५॥

 Due to the absence of that adarśanam, there is absence of association between intelligence and puruṣa which is an absolute cessation of bondage. This is removal (of association). It is the state of liberation of the seer; it is the unmixed state of the puruṣa, i.e., his not getting connected with the guṇas again. When there is cessation of the cause of pain there is cessation of pain—(this is) removal. At that time it is said that puruṣa abides in its own nature.

The four divisions are under discussion. In that context “heyam duḥkham”, i.e., it has already been said that *heyam . . . nāgatam*[^1100],i.e., one division which was in the place of disease has been explained. “heyakāraṇañca . . . ktam”[^1101]. The second division in the place of the cause for the disease, i.e., the cause which is to be avoided which co-exists with that caused by ignorance, which is the contact between puruṣa and pradhāna has been described. And its detailed description and mention along with the reasoning is with the purpose of removing any doubt (anxiety) regarding that subject. “ataḥ param hānam”, i.e, the division in place of health which is the purpose

 tad = this recalls avidyā which was mentioned earlier. “tasya... ityarthaḥ”[^1102],i.e., (in the absence of) avidyā there is (the absolute cessation) of the cause of pain (which is contact between puruṣa and pradhāna). “etat hānam” = (this is destruction of disease), this is in place of health; “tad...valyam”, i.e., that is removal of pain, absolute cessation of bondage (which is liberation of puruṣa, the seer). The explanation of this is given in the words “puruṣa ... guṇairityarthaḥ“.

[^1102]: "The bhāṣya has “buddhipuruṣasaṃyogābhāvaḥ” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “buddhipuruṣasaṃyogasya abhāvaḥ”."

 Having explained the individual words he indicates the meaning of the sentence as follows —“duḥkha... ktam”[^1103].“svarūpa...śaktiḥ”[^1104].

[^1103]: "The Vivaraṇakāra just quotes the bhāṣya without adding anything new to it."

[^1104]: "This is not in the bhāṣya but is in the Vivaraṇa. It is an alternative definition of liberation. YS, IV.34."

 Objection—But then, how can there be release when there is the presence of karma whose time of fruition is not fixed?[^1105]Moreover it is due to karma whose time of fruition is not fixed that there is the coming into being of the body.

[^1105]: "Since one cannot be sure that all karma meant to fructify would have been exhausted. There is no way of determining the time of fruition of karma which has no definite period for fruition."

 Answer—That is not so; it takes care of what has been said. As there is the burning up of the seed of afflictions through true insight it has been said that there is non-arising of karma; (this was done) giving the example of the state of burnt seed of the grains of rice from which the husks were removed[^1106]. Therefore in the case of one who knows (has insight) there is no rise of the body (birth) due to absence of cause.

[^1106]: "SCf. YS, II.13, and the bhāṣya under it."



अथ हानस्य कः प्राप्त्युपाय इति—

 Then what is the means to attain removal (of association)?

विवेकख्यातिरविप्लवा हानोपायः ॥२६॥

The means for removal (of association) is continuous discriminate-discernment.



 

सत्त्वपुरुषान्यताप्रत्ययो विवेकख्यातिः,सा त्वनिवृत्तमिथ्याज्ञाना प्लवते।यदा मिथ्याज्ञानं दग्धबीजभावं वन्ध्यप्रसवं संपद्यते तदा विधूतक्लेशरजसः सत्त्वस्य परे वैशारद्ये परस्यां वशीकारसंज्ञायां वर्तमानस्य विवेकप्रत्ययप्रवाहो निर्मलो भवति।सा विवेकख्यातिरविप्लवा हानस्योपायः।ततो मिथ्याज्ञानस्य दग्धबीजभावोपगमः पुनश्चाप्रसव इत्येष मोक्षस्य मार्गो हानस्योपाय इति ॥२६॥

 Discriminate-discernment is the knowledge of the difference between intelligenceand puruṣa. This is hindered when misapprehension has not been removed. When misapprehension attains the burnt-seed stage, incapable of sprouting again, then sattva, cleansed of the afflictions in the form of rajas, becomes pure. Then there is a (continuous) flow of discriminate-discernment while the mind, staying in the highest state of ‘vaśīkāra’,has attained a stage of supreme clarity. That continuous discriminate-discernment is the means to removal (of association). Then there is the burnt-seed stage of misapprehension and it does not sprout again. Therefore, this is the path to liberation (and) the means to removal (of association).

 The third division has been mentioned—i.e., the one in the place of health called removal (of pain). Now beginning to explain the fourth division which is in the place of means of cure (medicine) he says “hānasya kaḥ prāptyupāyaḥ iti”.

 Objection—But then,how can he ask ‘what is the means to attain hānam,as being a non-substance ‘hānam’ is not
[attainable.](http://॑# "The opponent raises an objection to the possession of hānam conveyed by the sense of ‘prāpti’; it is only a cessation of bondage and so a state of mind.") Hānam is only the cessation of bondage.



 Answer—This is no defect; as the cessation of ignorance is to be accomplished by effort; it is thus a distinction in the state of absorption (attainment). When there is discriminate-discernment there is cessation of avidyā; therefore even if hānam is not a substance it can be said to be attained.

* vivekakhyātiraviplavā hānopāyaḥ*.In answer to the question as to what is discriminate-discernment he says “sattva...yaḥ”, i.e., it is the knowledge in truth of the similarity and dissimilarity between the sattva-intellect (pradhāna) and puruṣa. “sa tu” that discriminate-discernment [“anivṛtta...plavate”](http://॑ "The bhāṣya has ”plavate” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has ”viplavate”.") is not strengthened, is not capable of any effect (when misapprehension is not removed); Thus it is said— ‘Just as gold whose impurity is not fully burnt (in fire) does not shine so also discriminate-discernment whose impurities have not been fully burnt does not [shine.](http://॑ "Not traced. Trevor Leggett mentions this as Viṣṇusahasranāma, 77.")’Similarly (there is the statement) ‘The knowledge of one who is influenced by desire is not [continuous.’](http://॑ "Not traced.")

[“yadā tu...bhāvam”](http://॑ "The bhāṣya has no “tu” but the Vivaraṇa has it."), i.e., because of its burnt-seed-stage “vandhya... dyate”: it is not capable of giving rise to effect; “tadā... rajasaḥ” in the case of that (sattva intelligence) which is such that its afflictions in the form of rajas has been removed. i.e., (of the sattva intelligence) which is not dirtied by the impurity of attachment, etc. “parasyām... nasya” = existing purely in the clarity of wisdom— he repeats the same idea as “viveka. . . bhavati”, i.e., there is a continuous state of discerning insight.

 “sā...vivekakhyātiḥ” = (insight) of this nature is without any break (continuous). When discriminate-discernment of this nature is continuous “tato... prasava"—being in opposition (to false sight) (it does not rise again) because of ignorance attaining the state of burnt-seed-stage.Thus it is said ‘Just as seeds burnt by fire do not sprout again so also through afflictions burnt by the fire of knowledge, the ātman does not get connected (with the body) [again.](http://॑ "Not traced.")’Discriminate-discernment of that kind “mokṣa...paya” is (the path to liberation...). This is the idea.

तस्य सप्तधा प्रान्तभूमिः प्रज्ञा ॥२७॥

 His prajña (true insight) is of seven kinds, reaching the highest point at each stage.

**** तस्येति प्रत्युदितख्यातेः प्रत्याम्नायः।सप्तधेत्यशुद्ध्यावरणमलापगमाच्चित्तस्य प्रत्ययान्तरानुत्पादे सति सप्तप्रकारैव प्रज्ञा विवेकिनो भवति।तद्यथा—

  The word. ‘tasya’ (in the sūtra) refers to one who has attained discriminate-discernment. The word ‘saptadhā’ means that, due to removal of the dirt in the form of the veil of impurity, when no other modification arises in the mind the yogīhas in-



sight of seven kinds only. They are as follows (1) That which is to be avoided is known; there is nothing more to be known in this direction.(2) The causes for avoidable pain have dwindled; there is nothing further to be dwindled. (3) By the samādhi of restraint, removal (of association between puruṣa and prakṛti) has been directly perceived. (4) The means of removal (of association) in the form of discriminate-discernment has been understood. These four are freedoms of insight which are effected by action.



चित्तविमुक्तिस्तु त्रयी।(५) चरिताधिकारा बुद्धिः।(६) गुणा गिरिशिखरकूटच्युता इव ग्रावाणो निरवस्थानाः स्वकारणे प्रलयाभिमुखाः सह तेनास्तं गच्छन्ति।न चैषां प्रतिप्रलीनानां पुनरस्त्युत्पादः,प्रयोजनाभावादिति।(७)एतस्यामवस्थायां गुणसंबन्धातीतः स्वरूपमात्रज्योतिः पुरुषः केवली शुद्ध इति।एतां सप्तविधां प्रान्तभूमिप्रज्ञामनुपश्यन्पुरुषः कुशल इत्याख्यायते।प्रतिप्रसवेऽपि चित्तस्य मुक्तः कुशल इत्येव भवति, गुणातीतत्वादिति ॥

  Freedom of the mind is threefold.(They are as follows): (5) The guṇas of the intelligence have fulfilled its purpose.(6) Similar to stones falling from the peaks of mountains without a support, they rushing towards dissolution merge in their own primary cause along with the mind. There is no more coming into existence of these guṇas which have merged completely because of absence of a purpose.(7) In this state puruṣa,having surpassed the association with the guṇas, shining in its own nature, is pure and is called kevala.

 That puruṣa who sees this sevenfold insight, reaching the highest point at each stage, is known as ‘kuśala’ (adept) when the mind has merged in prakṛti; then also the puruṣa is liberated and is a ‘kuśala’ because of surpassing the guṇas.

 In the case of one in whom insight has arisen, i.e., when insight has come into being, in order to indicate the (various) distinguishing marks of knowledge one has experienced, he says *tasya saptadhā...prajñā*. “tasyeti...mnāyaḥ” = (tasya) refers to one who has attained discriminate-discernment “sapta...gamāt”, i.e., the covering is impure, it is the afflictions and karma, that is the dirt (and) by its [removal;](http://॑# "A word by word meaning is given.")“cittasya... bhavati” when there is the non-arising of opposite thoughts like



mine, I, etc[^1107].The explanation of the word “saptadhā” is “saptaprakāraiva prajñā”[^1108], i.e., (the yogi has) insight. He explains those seven types (of prajñā) in order as “yathā....” and so on, i.e., all pain along with its properties which is to be destroyed, is known. There is no (further) division of pain (which is to be known by him).

[^1107]: "Meaning of “cittasya . . . nutpāde”."

[^1108]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything new to what the bhāṣya gives as definition."

 “kṣīṇa heyahetavaḥ” = by the use of the plural number both the afflictions and the actions are denoted. Not again will even a semblance of the afflictions and actions, having attained a burnt seed stage, having been burnt in the fire of discriminate-discernment, will be in need of destruction. By this statement its having reached its limit is alone indicated. In this way, with reference to one who has attained correct insight, as there is the dwindling away of afflictions there is nothing to be destroyed. And there arises the realisation marked by the fruit of true insight in the form that ‘I have accomplished what is to be accomplished.’When in the case of one afflicted by illness there is the destruction of the cause of illness there is the realisation as ‘I am free of illness; there is more need of any medicine.’ This is the second kind of prajñā (discriminate-discernment) mentioned.

 साक्षात्कृतं निरोधसमापत्तिर्हानम्।हानप्रत्यासन्नत्वात् हानतुल्यरूपत्वाच्च निरोधसमाधिरेव हानमित्याख्यायते।तच्च साक्षात्कृतम् अनुभवविषयतामानीतम्।तदिदं कैवल्यं पर्यवसितम् कैवल्यं कर्तव्यमिति च प्रज्ञायते।एषोऽपि प्रान्तभूमिप्रज्ञाप्रकारः तृतीय आख्यातः ॥

“sākṣāt . . . hānam”[^1109],
i.e., due to the proximity of removal (of association between sattva and puruṣa) and also because of reaching a state equal to ‘hānam’ he declares that meditation in the form of restraint is itself hānam (liberation). And that “sākṣātkṛtam” = has been brought under direct experience. This has resulted in kaivalya and it is also realised that kaivalya is to be attained[^1110]. This is also mentioned as the third division of prajñā that has reached its limit. “bhāvitaḥ... pāyaḥ”;“bhāvitaḥ” = it has been very well tested. When true insight has been verified to have stabilised, the prajñā that arises in the wise one, that is the fourth division of prajñā (insight). “ityeṣā” and so on, i.e., “kāryavimuktiḥ” = that prajñā which is free from any more work to be accomplished, i.e., any effect, is “kāryavimuktiḥ”; it is four kinds, i.e., it is the accomplishment of the purpose of puruṣa.  

[^1109]: "Instead of “nirodha samādhinā” in the bhāṣya the Vivaraṇakāra has “nirodhasamāptiḥ”."

[^1110]: "This state is not the ultimate; at one level there is an experience of kaivalya but since it is not continuous, kaivalya has to be made a continuous experience."

 Or it is (explained as)—freedom from effect (work to be accomplished), i.e., cessation is “kāryavimuktiḥ”. And it ends the sentence with “catuṣṭayī kāryavimuktiḥ”.[^1111]

 The word “prajñā” is to be connected with what comes after[^1112].How is this (connected?) That mind which has attained insight, i.e., that mind which is connected with discriminate-discernment, is “prajñācittam”, and its freedom, dissolution is “prajñācittavimuktiḥ”. That is of three kinds. He will mention that as “puruṣārtha...kaivalyam”.[^1113]

[^1111]: "All available readings in the bhāṣya end with prajñāyāḥ. But the Vivaraṇakāra makes a definite statement that the bhāṣya reading ends with “kāryavimuktiḥ”. He also has “prajñā” instead of “prajñāyaḥ” which he connects with “cittavimukti . . . ”. Miśra is aware of this second reading but does not mention “prajñā” in place of “prajñāyāḥ”"

[^1112]: "It looks as if the Vivaraṇakāra had the reading “prajñācittavimuktiḥ” in the next line."

 Therein, the liberation that is the effect, is of four kinds. The absence of a goal has already been mentioned. Now the cessation from the guṇas of intelligence (is mentioned). The dissolution of those (guṇas) which have no more goals to achieve for puruṣa, or (the dissolution) of those that accomplish the purpose of puruṣa, is the liberation of the mind with insight (prajñācitta). It is described as threefold. Thus “caritā...and so on, i.e., sattva in the form of intelligence, etc., having accomplished what is to be done—what happens then—because of absence of anything to be accomplished, merges without retaining any distinction, into the sense-of-I (its own cause) with the effect in the form of intelligence; or along with its own cause the sense-of-I, the cause,attains with regards to puruṣa an indistinctstate;[^1114]thus (it dissolves) along with it (the sense-of-I). This is the first freedom of the mind with insight.

[^1113]: "YS, IV.34."

[^1114]: "In the first option the emphasis is on the mind; in the second the emphasis is on puruṣa. In the first, the mind rests in its cause without any further activity; in the second the emphasis is on puruṣa. While it is the same mind which has gone back into its cause the twofold character of the mind comes into focus here in keeping with its ontology."

 न चैषां प्रतिप्रलीनानां पुरुषं प्रति पुनरस्त्युत्पादः प्रयोजनाभावात्।विमुक्तं हि चतुर्विधं कार्यम् । एषा द्वितीया प्रज्ञाचित्तविमुक्तिः॥

“na caiṣām ...bhāvāt” = the fourfold effect is indeed liberated[^1115],(as it has no pur- pose) for puruṣa. This is the second freedom of the mind with insight. “etasyām...” and so on, i.e., in the state of dissolution of the guṇas that have accomplished their purpose, there is surpassing of the association with the guṇas in the form of the seer and the seen. (Then) there is the illumination of oneself alone, the illumination of the nature of the seer. “puruṣa...iti” = (puruṣa pure, alone) this is the third freedom of the mind with insight.

[^1115]: "It probably denotes the threefold guṇas and the sense-of-I."

 “etām...” and so on. The etymological explanation of the word “prāntabhūmim”[^1116] is that which has reached the limits or the states which are the limits reached of that. Observing that purified (insight) marked by discriminate-discernment (puruṣa is known as kuśala).The word kuśala is a conventional usage[^1117].“pratiprasave’pi...” and so on, i.e., by what has gone by (puruṣa) is a kuśala (adept); why is he known as being an adept?—“guṇātītatvāt” = because he has surpassed the guṇas he is a kuśala.

[^1116]: "The Vivaraṇakāra splits the compound in the bhāṣya as “prāntabhūmim prajñāmanupaśyan”."

[^1117]: "Puruṣa at this stage is called so by convention."

 सिद्धा भवति विवेकख्यातिर्हानोपाय इति।न च सिद्धिरन्तरेण साधनमित्येतदारभ्यते—

 When discriminate-discernment is achieved then that is the means for removal of association. And achievement is not possible without practice (of its means). Therefore the following sūtra is begun.

योगाङ्गानुष्ठानादशुद्धिक्षये ज्ञानदीप्तिराविवेकख्यातेः ॥२८॥

 By practice of the different aids to yoga, when there is destruction of impurity there arises the light of knowledge culminating in discriminate-discernment.

योगाङ्गान्यष्टावभिधायिष्यमाणानि। तेषामनुष्ठानात्पञ्चपर्वणो विपर्ययस्याशुद्धिरूपस्य क्षयो नाशः।तत्क्षये सम्यग्ज्ञानस्याभिव्यक्तिः।यथा यथा च साधनान्यनुष्ठीयन्ते तथा तथा तनुत्वमशुद्धिरापद्यते।यथा यथा च क्षीयते तथा तथा क्षयक्रमानुरोधिनी ज्ञानस्यापि दीप्तिर्विवर्धते।सा खल्वेषा विवृद्धिः प्रकर्षमनुभवत्याविवेकख्यातेः।आगुणपुरुषस्वरूपविज्ञानादित्यर्थः।योगाङ्गानुष्ठानमशुद्धेर्वियोगकारणम् यथा परशुश्छेद्यस्य।विवेकख्यातेस्तु प्राप्तिकारणं यथा धर्मः सुखस्य, नान्यथा कारणम् ।

कति चैतानि कारणानि शास्त्रे भवन्ति ? नवैवेत्याह।तद्यथा—

उत्पत्तिस्थित्यभिव्यक्तिविकारप्रत्ययाप्तयः।  
वियोगान्यत्वधृतयः कारणं नवधा स्मृतम्॥

इति ।

 The limbs of yoga are eight; they are about to be mentioned. By their practice there is a reduction or destruction of misapprehension of the form of impurity, which is of five kinds. When that is destroyed there is manifestation of true knowledge. In proportion to the practice of the means, impurity also becomes gradually more and more weakened.As it becomes more and more weakened the light of knowledge increases in accordance with the rate of weakening. This growth of knowledge keeps attaining its perfection till it reaches discriminate-discernment, viz., till the insight which distinguishes between the guṇas and puruṣa is reached.



 The practice of the various limbs of yoga is the cause for separation of impurity just as the axe (is the cause) of cutting. It is also the cause for attaining discriminate-discernment similar to dharma (being the means) for pleasure. It is not a cause in any other sense. How many of these causes are mentioned in the śāstras? He says they are just nine (which) are as follows—origin, sustenance, manifestation, change, knowledge, attainment, separation, otherness and support.

 

तत्रोत्पत्तिकारणं मनो भवति विज्ञानस्य।स्थितिकारणं मनसः पुरुषार्थता, शरीरस्येवाहार इति।अभिव्यक्तिकारणं यदा रूपस्यालोकस्तदा रूपज्ञानम्।विकारकारणं मनसो विषयान्तरम्, यथाग्निः पाक्यस्य।प्रत्ययकारणं धूमज्ञानमग्निज्ञानस्य।प्राप्तिकारणं योगाङ्गानुष्ठानं विवेकख्यातेः।वियोगकारणं तदेवाशुद्धेः।अन्यत्वकारणं यथा सुवर्णस्य सुवर्णकारः।एवमेकस्य स्त्रीप्रत्ययस्याविद्या मूढत्वे, द्वेषोदुःखत्वे, रागः सुखत्वे, तत्त्वज्ञानं माध्यस्थ्ये।धृतिकारणं शरीरमिन्द्रियाणाम्, तानि च तस्य।महाभूतानि शरीराणाम्, तानि च परस्परं सर्वेषाम्।तैर्यग्यौनमानुषदैवतानि च परस्परार्थत्वादिति ।

 एवं नव कारणानि।तानि च यथार्थसंभवं पदार्थान्तरेष्वपि योज्यानि।योगाङ्गानुष्ठानं तु द्विधैव कारणत्वं लभत इति ॥२८॥

 Of these the mind is the cause of origin of knowledge; the cause of sustenance is like the purpose of puruṣa sustaining the mind or like food sustaining the body; the cause of manifestation is like when there is in the case of form the modification in the form of the object; the cause of change is a different object (which modifies) the mind, just as fire modifies the food to be cooked; the cause of knowledge is like the knowledge of smoke being (the cause of) the knowledge of fire; the cause of attainment is like the practice of the aids of yoga (to attain) discriminate-discernment; the cause of separation is like discriminate-discernment (being the cause of separation) of impurity; the cause of otherness is as the goldsmith is of gold; similarly with reference to the notion of the same woman, due to avidyā there is delusion, due to aversion there is pain, due to attachment there is pleasure, due to wisdom there is indifference; the cause of support (is like) the body (being the support) of the sense-organs, and (like) the sense-organs being its (support). So also the gross elements support the bodies, and each of these mutually (support) all others. Since they are mutually concerned with each other, animals, human beings and gods (support each other).

 In this way, there are nine causes. They are to be applied as far as possible to other objects as well. As for the practice of the aids of yoga they act as causes in two ways only, (separation and acquisition).

 “siddhā vivekakhyātiḥ” = discriminate-discernment culminating in the result of insight, reaching its sevenfold limit has been achieved.

 “hānasyopāya iti... ” ( there is no achievement) without practice of means; there-



fore this (sūtra) is begun in order to attain the purpose of achieving discriminate-discernment—yogāṅgānu ... vivekakhyāteḥ.

 It should not be understood that discriminate-discernment arises only by the practice of the means to yoga; the attainment of discriminate-discernment is desired also through devotion to the guru, through adherence to [dharma](http://॑# "It is difficult to imagine Śaṅkara advocating these as exclusive means to insight particularly dharma."), etc. Then what does it mean? It is to be understood to mean that without the means it cannot come into being. Moreover, the practice of the means of yoga is not the only means. But through the practice of the means of yoga there is the achievement of discriminate-discernment. Thus it is said by those who instruct—‘yoga is for the sake of realising the truth’.

“yogāṅga...nuṣṭhānam”[^1118], i.e., by the practice of means of yoga there is destruction (reduction) of impurity known as afflictions (and) when that is destroyed there is growth, illumination. What is its end? (In answer) he says *ā vivekakhyāteḥ*; the word ‘bhavati’ is to be added (to complete the sense)[^1119].

[^1118]: "The bhāṣya has “anuṣṭhānam” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra hasnuṣṭhānāt”. Also instead of “yogāṅgānyāṣṭāva” the Vivaraṇakāra has “yogāṅgānya . . . ”."

[^1119]: "The illumination is up to the rise of vivekakhyāti."

 The commentator himself explains it more clearly (through the words) “yogāṅgānya...vyaktih.”[^1120],i.e., (there is) illumination. In answer to the question as to how this occurs he says “yathā”...āpadyate”[^1121].Similarly, Manu said “Through prāṇāyāma the defects are destroyed and through concentration, etc., the impurities; through withdrawal of the sense-organs from sense objects attachment and through meditation the guṇas which are powerless”[^1122].

[^1120]: "Nothing much is added to what the bhāṣya has already stated."

[^1121]: "The Vivaraṇakāra again leaves the bhāṣya to speak for itself."

[^1122]: "MS, 6.72."

“yathā yathā vivardhate”[^1123];
the decline (in impurities) is compared as follows—as at the end of the cold season the rise of the sun. “sā khalviyam...bhavati”[^1124]. What is the limit at which it ends? He answers that as “ā vivekakhyāteḥ”.Its explanation is as

[^1123]: "Instead of “yathā yathā ca kṣīyate tathā tathā kṣayakramānurodhinī jñānasyāpi . . . ” the Vivaraṇakāra has “yathā yathā cāśuddhiḥkṣīyate tathā tathā tatkṣayakramānurodhinī jñānasya . . . ”."

[^1124]: "Instead of “sā khalveṣā” the Vivaraṇakāra, has “sā khalviyam”."



follows—“ā guṇapuruṣasvarūpavijñānātityarthaḥ”, i.e., culmination in the discriminate-discernment of (the nature of) the guṇas and puruṣa is itself the purity.

“yogānga...kāraṇam[^1125]” (The practice of yoga) has a twofold purpose; as an axe in the form of dharma it stands for two causes; (though) one it is a twofold (causal) agent; it is (not a cause in any other sense).

[^1125]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has the reading “yogāṅgānuṣṭhānamaśuddheḥ kṣayakāraṇam . . . vivekakhyāteśca prāptikāraṇam” instead of “yogāṅga . . . śuddheḥ viyogakāraṇam . . . vivekakhyātestu prāpti kāraṇam”."

 In that context, talking about cause he describes the various causes well-known in the sacred texts—“kati...bhavanti navaivetyāha”. He mentions them (the nine) through the following verse “utpatti...smṛtam iti”.  
  In order to distinguish them he will give some examples “tatrotpatti...vijñānasya” = the modification of the mind is knowledge just as water is of the waves, “sthitikāraṇam” = the cause for maintenance (is) “manasaḥ...rthatā”, i.e., the maintenance of the mind (in its mental state) is having experience and liberation (of puruṣa) as goals. This is like “śarīra...raḥ” (food) being the cause of maintenance of (the body).  
 
“abhivyakteḥ...kaḥ[^1126]”,“tadā rūpajñānam”, i.e., there is no knowledge (of form) if the form is not manifested by light.

[^1126]: " Instead of “abhivytikāraṇam” the Vivaraṇakāra has “abhivyakteḥ karaṇam”."

“[vikāra...ntaram](http://॑# "Again we have “vikārasya kāraṇam” instead of “vikārakāraṇam” in the bhāṣya.")”,i.e., it is only in the presence of a different object that the mind undergoes change. “yathā...pākasya[^1127]”,i.e., in the case of the change called cooking the cause for the change in the form of what is cooked is fire.

[^1127]: "Instead of “pākyasya” the Vivaraṇakāra has “pākasya”."

 “pratyaya...jñānasya”, i.e., being the cause of knowledge which in fact is the (cause of the) means of knowledge[^1128].Earlier when it was said that “bhavati vijñānasya[^1129]”,the idea was that it (mind) was the material cause (for knowledge).

[^1128]: "The cause being the means to knowledge."

[^1129]: " Here the cause for knowledge is mentioned as the means to knowledge but earlier under the first cause as the originating cause the mind was mentioned as the one which causes knowledge. Therefore the need for clarification."

 “prāpti...khyāteḥ”, i.e., (yoga being the cause for attainment of insight) is like (the observance of) dharma for attainment of pleasure. “tadeva...viyogakāraṇam[^1130]”(it is also the cause for dissolution from impurity) like the axe in the act of cutting[^1131].

[^1130]: "The Vivaraṇakāra transposes the order of the words in the bhāṣya."

[^1131]: "Cutting separates one thing from another. So also yoga practice removes the impurity through attainment of insight."


“anyatva...varṇasya[^1132]”,i.e., (The goldsmith) separates the gold and makes another, something bigger. He then separates the bigger (piece) and makes another ornament; thus it is a separating (cause).

[^1132]: "Instead of the sentence ending with “suvarṇakāraḥ”, the Vivaraṇakāra has “suvarṇasya” at the end."


“evamekasya...mūḍhatve[^1133]”= Hatred is the cause for pain with reference to the same idea of woman. So also attachment (is the cause) for pleasure. So also “mādhyasthe”= when there is absence of the thought of possession or avoidance the cause is “vivekayuktam jñānam[^1134]” = (knowledge with insight). In this way the one idea of woman, similar to gold, is divided into many forms due to the distinction of being deluded, painful, pleasurable or indifferent. “dhṛteḥ kāraṇam[^1135]”, i.e., support is upholding. The cause for that is (like) “śarīramindriyāṇām” (the body being the support for the sense-organs). It is not possible for the senses to gain support without having the body. “tāni tasya” and the sense-organs are the cause for the support of the body. The body is upheld only through the function of the senses[^1136].

[^1133]: "There is no “iti” after “strī” in the bhāṣya. The Vivaraṇakāra has “evam . . . strī iti pratyayasyāpi avidyā kāraṇam mūḍhatve”. The bhāṣya has “evamekasya strīpratyayasyāvidyā mūḍhatve”.The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything new to the meaning given in the bhāṣya."

[^1134]: "It appears that the Vivaraṇakāra had the reading “vivekayuktam jñānam” instead of “tattvajñānam”."

[^1135]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has “dhṛteḥ kāraṇam” instead of “dhṛtikāraṇam”."

[^1136]: "This is an interesting point; both are rated on an equal scale. The mutual, interrelatedness of the whole system is developed and brought out vividly here."

  तथा महाभूतान्याकाशादीनि शरीराणां धृतिकारणम्।महाभूतारब्धानि हि शरीराणि ब्रह्मादिस्तम्बावसानानि।(तानि च) परस्परम् उपकार्योपकारकत्वद्वारेण धृतिकारणम्॥

  Similarly “mahā...rāṇām” = ether (and other gross elements) are the causes for the support of the bodies. The bodies are started by the gross elements beginning with Brahmā and ending with a clump of grass “tāni...parasparam” = they are the cause of support mutually due to the relation of assisting and being assisted. So also “sarveṣām...tāni” all substances (such as animals, humans and devas) are the cause of support (mutually). Why is that so? “parasparārthatvāt” = as they have mutually related ends. Animals (for instance ) help both men and gods by serving as vehicles, for milking, as fire offering, etc., thus they are cause for support. Similarly humans, through sacrifices, protection,etc., are the cause for support of animals and gods. So also gods are the supporting cause for the other two through the cold and hot seasons and rain[^1137].

[^1137]: "The Gītā idea of the interdependence of the entire cosmos on each other is stressed."

 Similarly, the divisions of caste and stage of life,by mutually assisting each other, have the role of causes of support. The entire universe is supported by mutual dependence.


“evam...kāraṇāni”[^1138],i.e., (there are only nine causes); thus he denies any other cause[^1139].“tāni...yojyāni" = wherever there is the possibility of application (of these causes) to any situation it should be so applied even in (instances) which have not been mentioned. “yogāṅga...” and so on. (Practice of yoga is a twofold cause) which has been already explained (above).

[^1138]: "There is no “navaiva” in the bhāṣya which has only “nava”."

[^1139]: "Other than the nine mentioned."

  तत्र योगाङ्गान्यवधार्यन्ते—

  In that connection the limbs of yoga are being ascertained (in the coming sūtra).

यमनियमासनप्राणायामप्रत्याहारधारणाध्यानसमाधयोऽष्टावङ्गानि ॥२९॥

  Yama (restraint), niyama (observances), āsana (posture), prāṇāyāma (regulation of breath), pratyāhāra (withdrawal of the senses),dhāraṇā (concentration),dhyāna (meditation),and samādhi (oneness with object of meditation) are the eight limbs (of yoga).

यथाक्रममेषामनुष्ठानं स्वरूपं च वक्ष्यामः ॥२९॥

  We shall mention in order (serially) the way in which to practise them and their nature.

  कानि पुनस्तानि योगाङ्गानि?येषामनुष्ठानं द्विधा कारणत्वं लभत इति।तत्र योगाङ्गान्यवधार्यन्ते—यमनियमासनप्राणायामप्रत्याहारधारणाध्यानसमाधयोऽष्टावङ्गानि॥



  ननु च योगशास्त्रान्तरेष्वासनादीन्येव षडङ्गानि।तद्यथा—‘षडङ्गो योग उच्यते’ इत्यादि।किञ्च—साक्षादासनादीन्येव समाधेरुपकुर्वन्ति, न यमनियमौ ॥

 नैष दोषः।यमनियमवतोर्योगाधिकारोपपत्तेः।न हि यथाकामचारिणां योगाधिकारः।‘नाविरतो दुश्चरितान्नाशान्तः’ इति श्रुतेः।तथा—येषां तपो ब्रह्मचर्यं येषु सत्यं प्रतिष्ठितम् इत्यादि चाथर्वणे।तथा गीतायाम् ‘बह्मचारिव्रते स्थितः’ इति।तस्माद्यमनियमयोरप्यङ्गत्वम्॥

 यमनियमयोश्च यमस्य प्रथमोपादानं प्राधान्यख्यापनार्थम्।यमस्य हि प्राधान्यं सर्वत्र सिद्धम्।यमनियमयुक्तस्याधिकृतस्य योगिन आसनाद्यङ्गानां पूर्वपूर्वे स्थिरपदप्राप्तस्योत्तरोत्तरानुष्ठानं प्राप्तम्।न हि प्रथमं सोपानमनारुह्योत्तरमारोढुं शक्यम् ॥

  What are those means (limbs) of yoga—whose practice results in a twofold cause “tatra...ryante” *yamaniyama...ṅgāni.*

* *Objection—But then, in allied sacred texts on yoga the limbs are only six beginning with āsana. Thus it is said “Yoga is said to have six limbs".Moreover it is āsana (posture) and the rest that are the direct causes for samādhi and not yama (restraints) and niyama (observances).

 Answer—This is no defect—as one who practises yama and niyama is competent to practise yoga; those who do whatever they desire are not competent to practise yoga. The scripture says ‘One who has not desisted from bad conduct; whose senses are not under control[^1140].’Similarly, in the *Atharvaveda* (Upaniṣad) we have ‘In whom austerity, sense control (are established) in whom truth is established[^1141].’ ‘So also the Gītā states “He who is steady in the vow of brahmacarya[^1142].”Therefore yama and niyama are also limbs (means to yoga). In the two, yama and niyama, the mention of yama first is in order to indicate its importance. The importance of yama has been established everywhere. The yogi who is equipped with yama and niyama, who progressively attains proficiency in the earlier means like āsana, etc., is fit to practise the later means one by one. One who does not climb the first step cannot climb the later (second step)[^1143].

[^1140]: "Kaṭha Up. 2.24."

[^1141]: "Praś. Up. 1.15."

[^1142]: "Bha. Gītā, VI.14."

[^1143]: "While exceptions to this rule do occur, in general, this is the belief."

  यदन्यत्रोच्यते—

** **

**“स्थानासनविधानानि योगस्य विधयोऽपि वा ।  
  व्याक्षेपजनकाः सर्वे न ते योगस्य हेतवः ॥  
  सर्वदोषपरित्यागः समाधिश्चेति तद्द्वयम् ॥**  

**  निर्णय(यात्)योगहेतुः स्याद्भवति वान्यन्न वा (भवत्वन्यन्न वा भवेत् )॥” इति ।**

 तत्समाधिसर्वदोषपरित्यागयोः प्राधान्यात् तत्स्तुत्यर्थम्, नासनाद्यङ्गप्रतिषेधार्थम्। यथाक्रममेषां यमादीनामनुष्ठानं स्वरूपं च वक्ष्यामः—स्वरूपे हि अनवगते नानुष्ठातुं शक्यमिति ॥२९॥

  In another context this is mentioned (as follows)—“Fixed posture and other means of yoga, though means (of yoga) are all that cause distractions; they are not the causes for yoga; getting rid of all defects and steadiness (samādhi) is judged as the twofold



cause for yoga ;whether other means exist ornot.”[^1144]

 As samādhi and destruction of all defects are important the above (verse) is in order to praise them and not in order to deny (prohibit) posture and other limbs. “yathā...vakṣyāmaḥ” yama, etc, (will be described in order); without knowing their true nature it is not possible to practise them.

[^1144]: "Not traced. On the face of it the verse seems to discount all practices except the destruction of defects and samādhi. But what it means as the Vivaraṇakāra states later is, while other means are allowed, these two are mandatory."

 तत्र—

 Amongst them—

अहिंसासत्यास्तेयब्रह्मचर्यापरिग्रहा यमाः ॥३०॥

  Abstinence from injury (ahiṃsā), truthfulness (satya), abstinence from theft (asteya), continence (brahmacarya) and abstinence from avariciousness (aparigraha) are the restraints.

 तत्राहिंसा सर्वथा सर्वदा सर्वभूतानामनभिद्रोहः,उत्तरे च यमनियमास्तन्मूलास्तत्सिद्धिपरतयैव तत्प्रतिपादनाय प्रतिपाद्यन्ते,तदवदातरूपकरणायैवोपादीयन्ते।तथा चोक्तम्—स खल्वयं ब्राह्मणो यथा यथा व्रतानि बहूनि समादित्सते तथा तथा प्रमादकृतेभ्यो हिंसानिदानेभ्यो निवर्तमानस्तामेवावदातरूपामहिंसां करोति।

 Amongst them abstinence from injury means, not causing pain to all living creatures at all times and in all ways. The other restraints and observances are based on it. As they are meant to achieve it, they are taught in order to teach that (non injury). They have been understood as the means for making it (ahiṃsā) pure. In this connection it is said:—‘As this brāhmaṇa advances in the cultivation of the many vows he goes on turning away from sins based on violence caused by carelessness and thus makes non-injury itself pure.’

 सत्यं यथार्थं वाङ्मनसे।यथा दृष्टं यथानुमितं तथा वाङ्मनश्चेति।परत्र स्वबोधसंक्रान्तये वागुक्ता सा यदि न वञ्चिता भ्रान्ता वा प्रतिपत्तिवन्ध्या वा भवेदिति।एषा सर्वभूतोपकारार्थं प्रवृत्ता न भूतोपघाताय।यदि चैवमप्यभिधीयमाना भूतोपघातपरैव स्यान्न सत्यं भवेत्पापमेव भवेत्।तेन पुण्याभासेन पुण्यप्रतिरूपकेण कष्टं तमः प्राप्नुयात्।

  Truthfulness is correspondence of word and mind to fact, i.e., word and mind correspond exactly to what is seen and what is inferred. If words are spoken in order to convey one’s own knowledge to another it should not be deceitful or misleading or lacking in meaning. It should be used in order to benefit all living creatures and not for inflicting pain on living creatures. If by such an utterance there should be only harm to living creatures then that is not truth;and only sin arises from that. By appearing as virtue and by resemblance to virtue he attains only painful darkness (distress).



  स्तेयमशास्त्रपूर्वकं द्रव्याणां परतः स्वीकरणम्,तत्प्रतिषेधः पुनरस्पृहारूपमस्तेयमिति।ब्रह्मचर्यं गुप्तेन्द्रियस्योपस्थस्य संयमः ।

  विषयाणामर्जनरक्षणक्षयसङ्गहिंसादोषदर्शनादस्वीकरणमपरिग्रह इति एते यमाः ॥३०॥

  Theft is the illegal appropriation of things from another. And its absence is abstinence from theft of the nature of lack of even desire (for things).

 Continence is the control of the hidden sense-organ of generation.

 Abstention from avariciousness is ‘not accepting things’ due to seeing the various defects in their acquisition, protection, decay and in being attached to them and in harming them.

 These then are the yamas.

  तत्र तेषु यमादिषु प्रथमं यमा व्याख्यायन्ते—अहिंसासत्यास्तेयब्रह्मचर्यापरिग्रहा यमाः।तत्राहिंसा सर्वथा सर्वात्मना सर्वप्रकारेण, सर्वभूतानामनभिद्रोहः सर्वभूतानां स्थावरजङ्गमानां अनभिद्रोहोऽपीडनम्॥

  तथा ह्युक्तम्—स खल्वयं ब्राह्मणो यथा यथा बहूनि व्रतानि समादित्सते तथा तथा प्रमादकृतेभ्यो हिंसानिदानेभ्यः हिंसामूलेभ्यः हिंसाकारणेभ्यः निवर्तमानस्तामेवावदातरूपामहिंसां करोति इति॥

  “tatra” = in those (means) beginning with yama, firstly yama is described as ahiṃsā... yamāḥ.“tatra ... drohaḥ”, i.e., with one’s whole self, in everything, the non-injury of all animate and inanimate beings (is ahiṃsā). That non-injury is the most important amongst yama (restraints) and niyama (observances) (and) it is to be observed through body, speech and mind with one’s whole self—this is shown (through the words) “uttare ca...[^1145]” and so on; i.e., (the later restraints) like truth, etc., are for achieving non-injury; are for the sake of non-injury (and are taught) for the sake of attainment of non-injury. In answer to the question as to what is said in this connection he says “tada... pādīyante[^1146]”, i.e., they have been presented in order to indicate the purification of non-injury. Thus it is said “sa khalvayam brāhmaṇo ... karoti iti”.The meaning of “hiṃsānidānebhyaḥ” is those which have injury as their basis, (or) those that have injury as cause.

[^1145]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has “uttare ca yamāḥ . . . ” instead of “uttare ca yamaniyamāḥ . . . ”."

[^1146]: "Instead of “ . . . karaṇayaivopādīyante” the Vivaraṇakāra has “. . . karaṇāyopādīyante”."

  Observing many vows like truth, etc., and also observing other vows which are not in opposition to it (ahiṃsā), such a one has turned away from the cause of violence, i.e., he has turned away from exciting activity having violence as the basis; the arises non-injury of greater purity not having any basis for activity. In the case of one who is observing the vow of begging, etc., there is cessation of the basis of violence in the pursuit of agricultural activity[^1147].

[^1147]: "Agricultural activity will certainly involve killing of insects in the soil and so on."

“satyam...manaśceti[^1148]”.? That is the truth[^1149].The following is mentioned (here)—whatever true meaning is gained through correct means of proof the attempt to convey that knowledge as it is, to another through both speech and mind is truth.

[^1148]: "The bhāṣya does not have “yathā śrutam” but since the Vivaraṇakāra has it the scribe must have missed it. The bhāṣya begins with “yathā” but the Vivaraṇakāra begins the sentence with “satyam”."

[^1149]: "The definition follows."

 The same idea is conveyed (through the words) “paratra...” and so on. “sā...vañcitā” = i.e., though the true meaning is known even the truth sometimes becomes a lie when used for the sake of cheating others depending on the place and time; as for instance, when Yudhiṣṭhira said ‘Aśvatthāmā is dead, the elephant.’[^1150] “bhrāntā vā”, i.e., thinking it to be truth one speaks untruth.“pratipattivandhyā vā”= is not capable of informing the hearer: As for instance, a doubtful sentence whose various parts are not clear. Or when difficult words are used like “ajāvaya”, etc.[^1151]

[^1150]: "The famous incident when Droṇa would only believe the story of Aśvatthāmā’s death if Yudhiṣṭhira said so. Yudhiṣṭhira cheated in this incident mentioning that an elephant Aśvatthāmā was dead. Coming from Yudhiṣṭhira Droṇa believed it but the truth was used to hoodwink Droṇa.It is interesting to note that both Miśra and Bhikṣu use the same illustration. Is it a coincidence or has Miśra set the pattern."

 Therefore “eṣā" words which are devoid of the above mentioned defects following a straightforward mind “sarvas...pravṛtta”= enhances the truth.“na...ghātāya”=(when used not for injuring others) receiving strength based on fact, it attains the status of truth[^1152].

[^1151]: "Archaic usage."

[^1152]: "Perhaps what is hinted is that even if the intention is only to convey a fact, the thought of not injuring anyone uplifts it to the status of truth as a yogic means."

  “yadi...bhavet” = (even though words) are devoid of defects as described above (but when uttered result in harming others then it is not truth); even though that is free from the threefold defects such as [deceit, etc](http://॑# "Deceiftul, misleading and lacking in meaning are the threefold defects mentioned above.").,based on the intent to injure other living beings, it does not attain the status of truth[^1153]. “pāpameva bhavet” = (it still is demerit).

[^1153]: "Thus the mark of truth is not causing injury to any living being and not just a correspondence to truth."

  He mentions the same thing as “tena...pāpnuyāt[^1154]”,i.e., by bordering on truth like the truth uttered by Kauśika[^1155]. Therefore one should speak the truth that would result in the good of all, after careful thought[^1156]. It is also said “One should speak the truth; one should speak kindly; one should not utter truth that is unpleasant; one should not utter untruth which is pleasant; this is the eternal dharma.”[^1157]

[^1154]: "Instead of “puṇyapratirūpakena” the Vivaraṇakāra has “puṇyapratibiṃbakena”."

[^1155]: "Kausika‘s telling the truth ended in the robbers catching hold of the wealthy man and killing him. Thus though Kauśika spoke the truth literally it was no truth according to Yoga, as it ended in injury to a living being."

[^1156]: "The Vivaraṇa prints the line “tasmāt parīkṣya sarvahitam satyam brūyāt”."

 “steyam...svīkaraṇam” (Theft is appropriation of the wealth of others not sanctioned by the sacred books) and is caused by greed (desire). “tatpratiṣedhastu[^1158]”,i.e., because theft does not occur when greed is destroyed therefore that is the destroyer (opposer) of that theft. That is called “aspṛhārūpamasteyam[^1159]”.

[^1157]: "MS, IV.138."

[^1158]: "The bhāṣya has “tatpratiṣedhaḥ punaḥ” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “tatpratiṣedhastu”."

[^1159]: "So not just not stealing but non-theft with the absence of desire for objects is the complete form of non-stealing."


“brahmacaryam...saṃyamaḥ[^1160]”, i.e. (brahmacarya is the control of the sense-organ of generation); the control of the other organ of generation of puruṣa which is hidden, with the absence of activity of the mind, words, etc., which had the result of not observing brahmacarya[^1161].

[^1160]: "Instead of “guptendriyasyopasthasya . . .” the Vivaraṇakāra has “ ...upasthendriyasya ...”."

[^1161]: "Thus brahmacarya is not just celibacy but extends to even speech and mental activity pertaining to lack of sex control."


“viṣayā...aparigrahaḥ[^1162]” “asvīkaraṇam”= non-acceptance (is aparigraha).The non-acceptance is not because of lack of capacity (but because of realising their defects). “ityete yamāḥ”.

[^1162]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not attempt to explain this very important concept in any great detail."

** ** ते तु—

  And they—

जातिदेशकालसमयानवच्छिन्नाः सार्वभौमा महाव्रतम् ॥३१॥

  When not conditioned by class, place, time or concept of duty (they) are universal and constitute the great vow.



  तत्राहिंसा जात्यवच्छिन्ना—मत्स्यवधकस्य मत्स्येष्वेव नान्यत्र हिंसा।सैव देशावच्छिन्ना—न तीर्थं हनिष्यामीति।सैव कालावच्छिन्ना—न चतुर्दश्यां न पुण्येऽहनि हनिष्यामीति।सैव त्रिभिरुपरतस्य समयावच्छिन्ना—देवब्राह्मणार्थ नान्यथा हनिष्यामीति।यथा च क्षत्रियाणां युद्ध एव हिंसा नान्यत्रेति।एभिर्जातिदेशकालसमयैरनवच्छिन्ना अहिंसादयः सर्वथैव परिपालनीयाः।सर्वभूमिषु सर्वविषयेषु सर्वथैवाविदितव्यभिचाराः सार्वभौमा महाव्रतमित्युच्यन्ते ॥३१॥

  Of these non-injury conditioned by class is like the injury inflicted by a fisherman only to fish and nowhere else. The same conditioned by place is like saying ‘I shall not kill at a sacred spot.’ The same conditioned by time is like saying ‘I will not kill on the Chaturdasī day or on any sacred day.’ The same in the case of one who refrains from these three, is conditioned by a sense of duty (when) he says—‘I will kill for the sake of the gods and the brāhmaṇas and not otherwise.’ Similarly, injury is caused by kṣatriyas only in battle and nowhere else.

 Non-injury &c., unconditioned by class, place, time and sense of duty, are to be observed universally. When they are observed universally at all stages, towards all things and in every (possible) way without any exception, they are called the great vow.

 Since other dharmas are observed conditioned by birth, space, time, etc., it could also apply in this case as well—in order to refute that he says “[ete tviti](http://॑# "The bhāṣya has “te tu” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “ete tviti”.")”.“ete tu” = non-injury and others are called the great vows and are to be observed by those who renounce everything (the sannyāsins). In answer to the question as to what is the nature of these great vows he says *jātideśa... mahāvratam*. That which is great and is a vow is great vow. Greatness is having sway everywhere[^1163].

[^1163]: "Of universal application, thus, as in the case of Jainas, only that is a mahāvrata when applied as stated unconditionally."

  Question—How are these not considered by birth, etc. ?

 Answer—In order to indicate its unconditionality he illustrates non-injury by separating it from the rest[^1164] (through the words) “tatrāhiṃsā...hiṃsā”, i.e. (injury on fish by the fisherman)—that conditioned by fish-class stays within the context of fish without exceeding that—therefore it is not of universal application[^1165].

[^1164]: "Taking one as an example to illustrate the point."

[^1165]: "As fish are injured in this context."

  सैवाहिंसा देशावच्छिन्ना कथम् ? न तीर्थे प्रयागादौ हनिष्यामीति।तीर्थेष्वहिंसा च तीर्थादन्यं देशं न व्यश्नुत इति असार्वभौमी ॥

 Question—“saiva...cchinnā” = How is that (non-injury restricted by place).

 Answer—“na tirthe . . .” (this) non-injury is restricted to places of pilgrimage therefore it does not pervade places other than centres of pilgrimage—hence it is not universal in application.

 “saiva... cchinnā” (restricted by time) as in “na catur...ahanīti”, i.e., as it does not cover times other than the caturdaśī day and so on[^1166],that is also not of universal application.

[^1166]: "Caturdaśī being the new moon and full moon days. ādi covers other sacred days like ekādaśī, etc."

 “tribhiḥ...” and so on[^1167].(In the case) of that fisherman (not restricted by) birth, place or time, there is the “samayāvacchinnā” rule of adherence to one’s duty. How is that? “devabrāhma...” and so on.[^1168]

[^1167]: "Instead of “saiva” in the bhāṣya the Vivaraṇakāra has “tasyaiva”."

 Answer—(For the sake of the gods and the brāḥmaṇas ) I shall kill (and not otherwise)[^1169]; though it stays restricted to the rules of death anniversary, etc., and does not go beyond it, it is also not of universal application. “yathā ca kṣatriyasya...” is an illustration of restriction caused by adherence to the rules (of dharma).

[^1168]: "Instead of “debvabrāḥmaṇārthe” the Vivaraṇakāra has “debvabrāḥmaṇārtham”; and instead of “kṣatriyāṇām” in plural the Vivaraṇakāra has “kṣatriyasya” in singular."

[^1169]: "This has reference to the sacrifices."

  And these various restraints “jāti...cyante” (when practised) “sarvabhūmiṣu” = (without any condition of) birth, etc.; “sarvaviṣayeṣu” = with reference to all living beings, without exception (then), those (restraints) so qualified “sarva...cyante” (are called universal, great vows).

शौचसन्तोषतपः स्वाध्यायेश्वरप्रणिधानानि नियमाः ॥३२॥

  The observances are cleanlines (śauca), contentment (saṃtoṣa), self-discipline (tapaḥ), study (of the scriptures) and devotion to God (īśvarapraṇidhāna).

  तत्र शौचं मृज्जलादिजनितं मेघ्याभ्यवहरणादि च बाह्यम्।आभ्यन्तरं चित्तमलानामाक्षालनम्।संतोषः संनिहितसाधनाश्वासादधिकस्यानुपादित्सा।तपो द्वन्द्वसहनम्।द्वन्द्वश्च जिघत्सापिपासे शीतोष्णे स्थानासने काष्ठमौनाकारमौने च।व्रतानि चैषां यथायोगं कृच्छ्रचान्द्रायणसान्तपनादीनि।स्वाध्यायो मोक्षशास्त्राणामध्ययनं प्रणवजपो वा।ईश्वरप्रणिधानं तस्मिन् परमगुरौ सर्वकर्मार्पणम् ।

 यत्रेदमुक्तम्—ततः प्रत्यक्वेतनाधिगमोऽप्यन्तरायाभावश्च इति ॥३२॥

 Of these, external cleanliness consists of cleaning (oneself) with mud, water &c., and consumption of pure food &c., Internal cleanliness is the removal of impurities of the mind.

 Contentment is the lack of desire to possess anything more (of the necessities of life) because of satisfaction with what one has.

 Self-discipline is the capacity to bear the opposites; and the opposites are hunger and thirst, cold and heat, standing and sitting, absence of all expressions and absence of speech. They also include vows such as the fasts of kṛcchra, cāndrāyaṇa and sāṃtāpana so far as is necessary.

Study is the reading of śāstras pertaining to liberation or the repetition of the praṇava (Om), Devotion to īśvara means dedication of all actions to the highest teacher. (In this connection it is said) ‘Lying down or seated or wandering on the road he who is established in himself, having the net of doubts weakened, seeing the seed of saṃsāra dwindling, becomes eternally fixed in yoga enjoying immortality.’ With regard to this it has been said ‘From that (īśvarapraṇidhāna) arises realisation of the inner self and the absence of obstacles.’ (I.29)

*śauca...niyamāḥ*. “tatra...janitam”, i.e., the word ādi (etc.) indicates water also. “medhyā...bhakṣaṇāni ca”, i.e., food such as ghee, milk, etc. By the usage of the word “ca” one should understand seeing, hearing, etc., of anything that is pure. This is external cleanliness.

 He now mentions ( internal cleanliness)—“ābhyantaracittamalānām ākṣālanam”,i.e.,the (washing away) of (feelings) like desire, anger,etc.,with the waters in the form of meditating on their opposite feelings.

“saṃtoṣaḥ sannihita sādhanāśvāsāt”[^1170] (contentment) due to the presence of a sense of cheerfulness; “adhika...ditsā” = a sense of contentment even when not satisfied with what is at hand.

[^1170]: "Available readings have “sannihitasādhanādadhi . . . ” but the Vivaraṇakāra has “sannihitasādhanāśvāsādadhi . . . ”."

 “tapo...pipāse”. “jighatsā” = desire to eat; “pipāsā” = the desire to drink. Self-discipline is the endurance of the desire to eat and the desire to drink as a natural state; (or) self-discipline is caused by the desire to eat and the desire to drink in moderation.“Sītoṣṇe” = self-discipline by doing something unequalled or doing something modestly unequalled[^1171]. “sthānāsane” = There is a saying in the smṛti (traditional texts) in this context“Stand in the day time and sit in thenight”[^1172]“kāṣṭha...maune”[^1173]=silent as a piece of wood is (silence) along with absence of gesturing with hands, etc., silence unlike a piece of wood is absence of speech accompanied by gestures with hands, etc.

[^1171]: "It is interesting to notice the two kinds being mentioned side by side. This reminds one of the Jaina aṇuvrata and mahāvrata. Thus withstanding extreme heat and extreme cold would be one kind while the other could be enduring as much as one can."

[^1172]: "Gaut. DS, 3.8.6."

[^1173]: "Instead of “kāṣṭhamaunākāramaune” the Vivaraṇakāra has “kāṣṭhamaunākaṣṭhamaune”."

 “vratāni...yogam” = (vows) of the yogis as much as possible. In order to exclude those which oppose the performance of homa or which oppose the performance of dharma (karma), the expression ‘as far as possible is mentioned’[^1174].Which are these vows? “kṛcchra...”[^1175]denotes (the vows like) prājāpatya, etc. It is described as ‘(Eat) once in the morning for three days, once in the evening for three days, three days by alms not asked for and three days fastings’[^1176].“candrāyaṇam” is the fast undertaken amidst barley grain, black ants, etc.[^1177].") There are statements in the smṛti like ‘There should be an increase (in food intake) one by one mouthful’[^1178].

[^1174]: "Dharma promoted by rituals, thus those karmas enjoined in the ritual codes. Only those vows were to be encouraged which did not stand in the way of this dharma. The author definitely believes in karma and is not like Śankara the advaitin."

[^1175]: "The bhāṣya does not have “kṛcchrādīni” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra uses that term."

[^1176]: "MS, XI.212."

[^1177]: "Will Śaṅkara go into such great details about karma (vrata

[^1178]: "MS, XI.217, 218 one mouthful at a time, increasing with the growth of the moon and decreasing with its decline. Instead of “evamādi . . .” the Vivaraṇakāra has “ityevamādi”."


“sāntapanam”[^1179] (It is described as) ‘The urine of the cow, cow-dung, milk, curds, grass and water, and fast for one night is considered the difficult vow of santapana’[^1180]. “When the fast is observed with the said objects three times it is called the great sāntapana. The word “adi”[^1181] is used in order to indicate such vows as parāka, etc[^1182] is parāka.").

[^1179]: "It must be noted that the Vivaraṇakāra breaks up the compound in the bhāṣya and quotes each one separately which is not as it is in the bhāṣya. The additional being going back to an unspiritual life."

[^1180]: "MS, XI.213."

[^1181]: "In “kṛcchra . . . ādīni” in the bhāṣya."

[^1182]: "Afast for twelve days (day and night

 “svādhyāyo...yanam” = the study of sacred texts like the Upaniṣads, etc., or the repetition of Om[^1183].“pratyak...bhāvaśceti”[^1184]

[^1183]: "This definitely points to a period when japa has gained an equal status with jñāna."


[^1184]: "As mentioned in the published manuscript there seems to be something missing here as the important topic of īśvarapraṇidhāna has been left out. The Vivaraṇakāra does not comment on this line either."


  एतेषां यमनियमानाम्—

  With reference to yamas and niyamas.

वितर्कबाधने प्रतिपक्षभावनम् ॥३३॥

  When perverse thoughts oppose (them) there should be meditation on opposite (thoughts).

  यदास्य ब्राह्मणस्य हिंसादयो वितर्का जायेरह्ननिष्याम्यहमपकारिणमनृतमपि वक्ष्यामि, द्रव्यमप्यस्य स्वीकरिष्यामि, दारेषु चास्य व्यवायी भविष्यामि,परिग्रहेषु चास्य स्वामी भविष्यामीति।एवमुन्मार्गप्रवणवितर्कञ्चरेणातिदीप्तेन बाध्यमानस्तत्प्रतिपक्षान्भावयेत्—घोरेषु संसाराङ्गारेषु पच्यमानेन मया शरणमुपागतः सर्वभूताभयप्रदानेन योगधर्मः।स खल्वहं त्यक्त्वा वितर्कान्पुनः पुनस्तानाददानस्तुल्यः श्ववृत्तेनेति भावयेत्।यथा श्वा वान्तावलेही तथा त्यक्तस्य पुनराददान इत्येवमादि सूत्रान्तरेष्वपि योज्यम् ॥

  When this brāhmaṇa (practising yama and niyama) is tormented by the fiery fever of perversity which leads him towards evil and has perverse thoughts of injury &c., such as ‘I shall kill the wrong doer, I shall speak falsehood, I shall appropriate this man’s wealth, I shall commit adultery with this man's wife, I shall become the master of the things this man possesses,’ he should cultivate their opposites.

 He should meditate thus—Being burnt in the cruel fires of the world I have taken refuge in the practice of yoga by giving protection to all living creatures.Having abandoned perverse thoughts I am again and again resorting to them like the behaviour of a dog.As a dog licks its vomit so also (I am behaving) by resorting to that which has been given up.

  Similar (opposite thoughts) should be applied to other sūtras also.

  तत्र यमनियमानां विरुद्धास्तर्काः वितर्काः, तैः बाधने सति प्रतिपक्षान् भावयेत् अभिधास्यमानेन प्रकारेण । अप्रतिभाव्यमाना हि वितर्का योगिनं हिंसादिषु प्रणिधापयेयुः ॥

  In that context the vitarkas (opposite thoughts) are those that oppose “yamaniyamānām” (yama and niyama). When there is obstruction from them (from such thoughts) then one should meditate on their opposites—in the manner to be described. Opposite thoughts not obstructed with contrary (ones) will cause the mind of the yogi to engage in thoughts of violence, etc.

 Question—“yadā...yeran”, i.e., (in such a situation) of what nature are these opposite thoughts like non-injury, etc., or (what is the nature of) thoughts of injury, etc., and their opposites?

 Answer—In that context, the contrary of non-injury is injury “hani...bhaviṣy-



āmīti”.[^1185] Similarly the contrary thought of (speaking the) truth is falsehood. So also the opposite thought of non-stealing is (I shall take this man’s wealth). Similarly the contrary idea of sense control is (I shall enter this man’s wife). And so also the opposite of non-covetousness is (I shall own his possessions).

[^1185]: " Many words here are either split into their parts from the compound or quoted differently. Thus the bhāṣya has “haniṣyāmyahamapakāriṇam”, the Vivaraṇakāra has “haniṣyāmyapakāriṇam”. Instead of “anṛtamapi vakṣyāmi” the Vivaraṇakāra has “anṛtam vadiṣyāmīti”; instead of “dravyamapyasya” the Vivaraṇakāra has “dravyamasya”; instead of “ . . . vyayāyī bhaviṣyāmi” the Vivaraṇakāra has “ . . . gamiṣyāmi”."

 The word “asya[^1186]”has been used in order to indicate that it is to be applied everywhere in situations of thought of injury, etc.

[^1186]: " In the examples given the pronoun is used for general application."


“dravyamasya...[^1187] ”,i.e., connecting oneself with the wealth of another. “pari... svāmīti”[^1188],i.e., considering oneself the owner of wealth belonging to others. Such as (the wealth of) ministers, kings and princes.

[^1187]: "  Here again instead of “dravyamapyasya” we have “dravyamasya”."

[^1188]: " Instead of “svāmī bhaviṣyāmīti” we have “svāmīti”."

  “itham... bhāvayet”.[^1189]

 Question—In what manner should one meditate?

[^1189]: "Instead of “evam” the Vivaraṇakāra has “itham”. Instead of “unmārgapravaṇavitarkajvareṇātidīptena” the Vivaraṇakāra has “unmārgahāriṇā vitarkajvareṇa dīptena”. The Vivaraṇakāra also does not add anything new to what the bhāṣya says."

 Answer—“ghoreṣu... śvavṛtteneti[^1190]” (giving up the opposite thoughts) like causing injury, etc. (I am again resorting to it). The analysis of the compound “śvavṛttaḥ” one whose behaviour is like that of a dog, or it could also be analysed as dog-like-behaviour is “śvavṛttaḥ”. Thus he (must meditate) that it is similar to that of (a dog’s behaviour). “yathā... kurvan”[^1191](he must add this to thisthought),[^1192] i.e., ‘I am equal to that (ordinary) man—how should I behave (be)—this behaviour is not proper for me’ (thus should he meditate).

[^1190]: "Instead of “Śaranamūpāgataḥ” the Vivaraṇakāra has “śaranamabhyupagataḥ”. One “punaḥ” has been left out by the Vivaraṇakāra. There is also nothing added to what the bhāṣya says."

[^1191]: " Instead of “punarādadāna” the Vivaraṇakārahas “punarādānam kurvan”."

[^1192]: " He should compare himself to the dog licking its vomit, i.e., going back to a non-yogī life."

 “itye... yojyam[^1193]” one should observe contrary thoughts regarding each, (observance) like cleanliness, etc., such as ‘I will not observe cleanliness’, etc. In the commentary only the (opposites of) restraints have been mentioned as they are to be

[^1193]: " Instead of “evamādi . . .” the Vivaraṇakārahas ”ityevamādi”."



observed compulsorily; in not observing them there is the additional danger of defects[^1194]; therefore to draw special attention to them (they have been mentioned).

[^1194]: "The additional being going back to an unspiritual life."

**वितर्का हिंसादयः कृतकारितानुमोदिता लोभक्रोधमोहपूर्वका मृदुमध्याधिमात्रा  
दुःखाज्ञानानन्तफला इति प्रतिपक्षभावनम् ॥३४॥**

 Perverse thoughts such as causing injury &c., whether done by oneself or caused to be done or approved, preceded by greed,anger and delusion which is mild,moderate or intense,result in endless pain and ignorance—this (kind of thought) is an opposite thought.

  तत्र हिंसा तावत्—कृता कारितानुमोदितेति त्रिधा।एकैका पुनस्त्रिधा—लोभेन मांसचर्मार्थेन, क्रोधेनापकृतमनेनेति, मोहेन धर्मो मे भविष्यतीति।लोभक्रोधमोहाः पुनस्त्रिविधा मृदुमध्याधिमात्रा इति।एवं सप्तविंशतिर्भदा भवन्ति हिंसायाः ।

  Of these injury can be of three types—either done by oneself, caused to be done by another or approved when done by another. Each one of them again is of three kinds. Through greed, as in the case (of killing an animal) for its meat and skin; through anger, as in the case of one who has been harmed by another; through delusion, as in the case of one who believes that dharma will accrue (by killing in sacrifice). Greed, anger and delusion are again of three types—mild,moderate and intense. Thus there are twenty-seven divisions of injury.

  मृदुमध्याधिमात्राः पुनस्त्रिविधाः—मृदुमृदुमध्यमृदुस्तीव्रमृदुरिति।तथा मृदुमध्यो मध्यमध्यस्तीव्रमध्य इति।तथा मृदुतीव्रो मध्यतीव्रोऽधिमावतीव्र इति।एवमेकाशीतिभेदा हिंसा भवति।सा पुनर्नियमविकल्पसमुच्चयभेदादसंख्येया, प्राणभृद्भेदस्यापरिसंख्येयत्वादिति।एवमनृतादिष्वपि योज्यम् ।

  Mild, moderate and intense are again of three kinds each. Mildly mild,moderately mild and intensely mild. Similarly mildly moderate, moderately moderate and intensely moderate.Similarly mildly intense, moderately intense and intensely intense. In this way there are eighty-one kinds of injury. This again is innumerable since living creatures are innumerable because of varieties due to customary rules, option (whether to sacrifice one or another animal) and collectiveness (sacrificing every kind of animal). The same division is to be applied to falsehood &c.

  ते खल्वमी वितर्का दुःखाज्ञानानन्तफला इति प्रतिपक्षभावनम् दुःखमज्ञानं चानन्तं फलं येषामिति प्रतिपक्षभावनम्।तथा च हिंसकस्तावत्प्रथमं वध्यस्य वीर्यमाक्षिपति, ततश्चशस्त्रादिनिपातनेन दुःखयति, ततो जीवितादपि मोचयति, ततो वीर्याक्षेपादस्य चेतनाचेतनमुपकरणं क्षीणवीर्यं भवति, दुःखोत्पादान्नरकतिर्यक्प्रेतादिषु दुःखमनुभवति, जीवितव्यपरोपणात्प्रतिक्षणं च जीवितात्यये वर्तमानो मरणमिच्छन्नपि दुःखविपाकस्य नियतविपाकवेदनीयत्वात्कथञ्चिदेवोच्छ्वसिति।यदि च कथञ्चित्पुण्यावापगता हिंसा भवेत्तत्र सुखप्राप्तौ भवेदल्पायुरिति।एवमनृतादिष्वपि योज्यं यथासंभवम्।एवं वितर्काणां चामुमेवानुगतं विपाकमनिष्टं भावयन् न वितर्केषु मनः प्रणिधीत ॥३४॥



  These perverse thoughts have endless results of pain and ignorance-this is the kind of opposite thought; i.e., opposite thought is like this—they have unending results of pain and ignorance. Thus the agent of injury first reduces the strength of the victim. Then (he) inflicts pain through weapons and finally takes his life even. Because of reducing the strength (of the victim) his conscious and unconscious aids lose their strength. Because of inflicting pain he suffers pain in hell or is born as an animal or as a disembodied spirit and so on. Because of taking away its life he also continues from moment to moment at the point of death. Even though he desires to die, due to the fixed result to be experienced, he somehow continues to live. If somehow, through merit, the demerit due to injury is reduced then though he gets happiness he will be short-lived.

 In the same way, as far as possible, this line of argument is to be applied to falsehood &c. Thus thinking of the indescribable result which is connected with perverse thoughts one should not let the mind engage in perverse thoughts.

  The nature of the opposite thoughts, their divisions and the reason for their influence (power) and their result are all indicated by the (following) sūtra itself...*vitarkā hiṃsādayoḥ* is their nature. *kṛtakārita...tā* is the various divisions. *lobha...pūrvakā* is the reason for their power. *mṛdumadhya...trā* is the defects of a mild, middling or extreme form. *duḥkha...phala* (result in pain, etc.) is the meditation on the contrary thoughts; or the result is also described by that itself.[^1195]

 “tatra hiṃsaiva[^1196]” (injury) alone is illustrated as an instance in order to apply it for all (the others). That is “kṛta...trividhā[^1197]”, i.e. (done) by one's own effort, (caused to be done) through the effort of another, or (approved) mental approval of the action of another.

[^1195]: "One is to think of these results as contrary to injury, etc., and the other is to pinpoint that this is the result of such thoughts of injury, etc. While the end is the same the emphasis is different."

[^1196]: "The bhāṣya has “. . . hiṃsā” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “. . . hiṃsaiva”."

[^1197]: "Instead of “tridhā” the Vivaraṇakāra has “trividhā”."

 “ekaikā...dhā”—How are (they further divided into) three kinds. “lobhena...



rthī[^1198]”,i.e. (out of greed for the skin and meat) one kills a deer (animal). “krodhena...bhaviṣyatīti[^1199]” = thus these are of nine types. Each of these are further divided into three types[^1200].How is this? “lobha...mātra iti”; “tridhā...bhavati[^1201]” (There are thus 81 different kinds of hiṃsā).

[^1198]: "Instead of “. . . rthena” the Vivaraṇakāra has “rthi”."

[^1199]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not elaborate on these."

[^1200]: "Here instead of “ . . . trividhaḥ” the Vivaraṇakāra has “ . . . tridhā”."

[^1201]: "There is no “bhavati” after “punastridhā” in the bhāṣya which the Vivaraṇakāra has. So also instead of“ . . . adhimātratīvra” the Vivaraṇakāra has “tīvratīvra”."

 These eighty-one divisions also become countless (endless) due to “niyoga...dāt”. Thus the division based on rules is as follows—when one person is appointed (to do the deed) he appoints another and he again another. All these (then) are persons appointed (for the deed) and cause injury collectively or singly[^1202].Thus the one who first appoints (another) commits violence (injury) along with the appointees either collectively or individually “vadhya...” (because of the various kinds of living beings being innumerable) like those to be sacrificed (killed) those who kill, etc., (injury is also endless).

[^1202]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything except to quote the bhāṣya here.Each one of them is guilty of the crime. The usual argument that the animal whose meat is eaten was not killed by oneself, does not abjure the eater from the crime of injury."

 The same (kind of reasoning) must be applied (to other restraints and observances) like uttering falsehood, etc., i.e., done by oneself, caused to be done by another and approval when done by another must be connected (with the other restraints and observances as well).

 “te khalvamī...phalā”. Pain and ignorance is the analysis of the word “duḥkhājñāne”—they have them (pain and ignorance) as endless (results). So they are “duḥkha...phalāḥ”. (He further explains it as) of these, pain is the endless result, of these ignorance is the endless result. Therefore one should not consider these



bad thoughts even mentally (but meditate on their opposites).

 In that context he describes the three kinds of pain with reference to the one in- jured (tortured) through their division, in order to indicate the different types of result. “tathā...[^1203]” and so on. Thus through the form, look and abusive language of the killer, having reduced the strength of the victim “śastra... mocayati”, i.e., (then attacks with weapons and kills the victim), i.e., disconnects (the victim) from life, (ends his life). “tasya... bhavati[^1204]” = the (conscious and unconscious elements which belong to the animal field) of the one who inflicts pain “kṣīṇa...bhavati[^1205]” (lose their strength). Because of special injury caused by the use of weapons, “naraka...bhavati[^1206]” (he suffers pain in naraka, etc.).

[^1203]: "Instead of “hiṃsakastāvat prathamam vadhyasya . . . ” the Vivaraṇakāra has “hiṃsako vadhyasya . . .”."

[^1204]: "Again instead of “tato vīryā . . .” the Vivaraṇakāra has “tasya vīryā . . .”."

[^1205]: "The elements which were used in the attack of the victim like sense-organs of knowledge and motor action."

[^1206]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything to the commentary."

 Then “jīvita...ucchvasiti[^1207]”, i.e. (he lives) in this road between life and death[^1208] (desiring death) every moment (somehow breathes on) because he has to certainly experience (the result which is determined).

[^1207]: "Instead of “ . . . niyatavipākavedanīyatvāt” the Vivaraṇakāra has “niyatavedanīyatvāt”. The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything much to the commentary except a couple of comments."

[^1208]: "Already born he has to continue in this path till death arrives."

  “yadi... bhavedalpãyuḥ[^1209]” (if due to great merit gained, injury) gets reduced (then even if getting pleasure) through merit gained (he will be shortlived) because of the defect of injury already sown.

[^1209]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has the reading “kathamcitpuṇyāvagamāt puṇyāvāgatā” whereas the bhāṣya does not have “ . . . puṇyāvagamāt . . .”."

 “itham... yojyam[^1210]” (Similarly wherever possible) this has to be applied to injuries like (speaking falsehood, etc.) “evam... praṇidadhīta[^1211]” (one should not engage in perverse thoughts knowing the painful result that accrues) to deeds of injury, etc.

[^1210]: "The bhāṣya ends with “yathasaṃbhavam”, the Vivaraṇa ends with “yojyam”. So also instead of “evam . . . ” the Vivaraṇakāra has “itham . . . ”."

[^1211]: "The reading of the bhāṣya in the Vivaraṇa is slightly different. It is “evam vitarkāṇām cchāyāmivānugatam vipākamaniṣṭam bhāvayet . . . ”."

 प्रतिपक्षभावनाद्धेतोर्हेया वितर्का यदाच स्युरप्रसवधर्माणस्तदा तत्कृतमैश्वर्यं योगिनः सिद्धिसूचकं भवति।तद्यथा—

 When perverse thoughts which are to be avoided become unproductive due to the cultivation of opposite thoughts then the power acquired by it indicates the perfection of the yogi. For example:

**अहिंसाप्रतिष्ठायां तत्सन्निधौ वैरत्यागः ॥३५॥**

  When abstention from injury is established there is absence of enmity in his presence.

  सर्वप्राणिनां भवति ॥

  This happens in the case of all living creatures.



  प्रतिपक्षभावनाहेया वितर्काः यदा च स्युरप्रसवधर्मिणः अप्रसवाश्च ते धर्मिणश्चेत्यप्रसवधर्मिणः।यदा योगिनो मनसि नोत्पद्यन्ते निकृत्तमूलाः सन्तः,तदा तत्कृतं यमनियमस्थैर्यकृतम् ऐश्वर्यं योगिनः सिद्धिसूचकम् अहिंसादिफलसिद्धिज्ञापकं जायत इति योगसिद्धिफलमवस्थितमेव।अन्यदपि योगाङ्गस्तुतये ऐश्वर्यमनुषङ्गजातमुच्यते।कथम् ? एकैकस्याप्यहिंसादीनां स्थिरत्वलिङ्गमीदृशं यज्ञादिधर्मफलैरप्यसमानं प्रत्यक्षत उपलभ्यते,किमङ्ग संहतानां योगसिद्धिकरत्वमिति।तदेतत्प्रतिदर्शयति—तद्यथा—अहिंसाप्रतिष्ठायाम् अहिंसास्थिरत्वे अवितर्कप्रादुर्भावे।तत्सन्निधौ वैरत्यागः।शाश्वतिकविद्वेषिणामपि सर्पनकुलादीनां तस्य अहिंसकस्य सन्निधौ वैरत्यागो भवति ॥३५॥

 
“pratipakṣa...dharmiṇaḥ[^1212]”. The analysis of the compound “aprasavadharmiṇaḥ” is—the properties that are unproductive. Due to the roots being cut when (the opposite thoughts) do not arise in the minds of the yogīs “tadā...sūcakam” (then) the perfections indicating the fruition of (practice of) non-injury comes into being, i.e., he attains the result of the perfection of yoga (practice). In order to praise (the perfection arising from) other aids to yoga he describes the group of closely connected perfections. How does he do that? The mark of steadiness in each one of the (restraints) like non-injury, etc., is of this kind—thus one directly achieves results which are superior to the result of performing dharma like sacrifices, etc., thus, which means amongst the closely connected (means) gives rise to (which) perfection in yoga ( is mentioned ).Thus he indicates that (through the words) “tadyathā" *ahiṃsā...vairatyāgaḥ*, i.e., in achieving steadiness in (practice of ) non-injury, in the achievement of absence of contrary thoughts (to non-injury) there arises in the presence of the non-violent person, absence of enmity even amongst perpetual (sworn) enemies such as a cobra and a mongoose, etc.

[^1212]: "Instead of “pratipakṣabhāvanāddhetorheyā” the Vivaraṇakāra has “pratipakṣabhāvanāheyā”."

सत्यप्रतिष्ठायां क्रियाफलाश्रयत्वम् ॥३६॥

  When truthfulness is established he becomes the support for action and fruition.

  धार्मिको भूया इति भवति धार्मिकः।स्वर्गं प्राप्नुहीति स्वर्गं प्राप्नोति।अमोघास्य वाग्भवति ॥३६॥

  When he utters the words ‘Be virtuous’ the person addressed becomes virtuous. When he utters the words ‘Go to heaven’ he attains heaven. His words are not belied.

 सत्यप्रतिष्ठायां सत्यस्थैर्ये क्रियाफलाश्रयत्वं यज्ञादिक्रियाफलानामागमनं प्राप्तिर्भवति सत्यवादिवाक्यादिति शेषः।कथम् ? अधार्मिकोऽपि धार्मिको भूया इत्युक्ते तद्वचनाद्धार्मिको भवति।यथा धर्मेऽस्य रमतां मन इति देवैरुक्तः कुण्डधाराराधी ब्राह्मणो धार्मिको बभूव।तथा स्वर्गं प्राप्नुहीत्युक्तः स्वर्गं प्राप्नोति।यथा विश्वामित्रेणोक्तः स्वर्गं प्राप्नुहीति त्रिशङ्कः स्वर्गं प्राप किं बहुना। अमोघाऽस्य वाक् भवति ॥३६॥

* *satyapratiṣṭhāyām...śrayatvam = in attaining steadiness in truth *kriyā...tvam* = there is the fulfilment, success of the results of deeds like sacrifices, etc., ‘due to truthful speech’ must be added (to the sūtra to complete the sense). How does this happen? Even when one who is not virtuous is told “dhārmiko bhūyā” ( Be virtuous ) he becomes (virtuous) through his words.

 Thus when Kuṇḍadhārārādhī was told by the gods ‘Let his mind be devoted to



dharma’ he became a virtuous brāhmana[^1213]. Similarly when somebody is told ‘You will attain heaven (svarga)’ he “svargam prāpnoti” (attains heaven). This is like Triśaṅku who when told by Viśvāmitra that he will attain heaven did go to heaven[^1214]—In short it means “amoghāya vāk bhavati” (that his word is not belied).

[^1213]: "MBH, Moksa, 271."

[^1214]: " This is a famous story of the king Triśaṅku being sent to heaven in his mortal body by Viśvāmitra. He was thrown from heaven head downwards by Indra and others but Viśvāmitra arrested him in the midregions and so he became a constellation in the southern skies."

अस्तेयप्रतिष्ठायां सर्वरत्नोपस्थानम् ॥३७॥

 When abstention from theft is established all jewels come to him.

 सर्वदिक्स्थान्यस्योपतिष्ठन्ते रत्नानि ॥

 Jewels from all directions come to him.

  अस्तेयप्रतिष्ठायां अस्पृहायाम्।ततः किमस्य भवति ? रत्नोपस्थानं भवति सर्वदिक्स्थान्यस्योपतिष्ठन्ते रत्नानि आत्मानं दर्शयन्ति ॥३७॥


*asteya...sthānam*[^1215](when there is no greed)—then what happens to him (to such a yogī)? *ratnopasthānam* occurs, i.e., “sarva...ratnāni ātmānam[^1216]”(jewels from all directions) appear before him.

[^1215]: "The sūtra reads asteya. , , ,sarvaratna. . . . But the Vivaraṇakāra has asteya . . . . ratnopasthānam."

[^1216]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has “ātmānam” after “asyopatiṣṭhante” which is not there in available readings."

ब्रह्मचर्यप्रतिष्ठायां वीर्यलाभः ॥३८॥

 When continence is established there is acquisition of power.

यस्य लाभादप्रतिघान्गुणानुत्कर्षयति,सिद्धश्च विनेयेषु ज्ञानमाधातुं समर्थो भवतीति ॥३८॥

 By the acquisition of which (power) various attainments are perfected without any obstacles. Having attained perfection he is capable of imparting knowledge to his disciples.

ब्रह्मचर्य प्रतिष्ठायां वीर्यलाभः।ब्रह्मचर्यलाभादप्रतिघान् गुणानुत्कर्षयति।अप्रतिबन्धानात्मन उपपादयति।सर्वशुभार्थप्रवृत्तिष्वप्रतिबद्धवीर्यो भवति। न केनचित् प्रतिघातेन विवध्यत इत्यर्थः ॥

 किञ्च—विनयेषु शिष्येषु योग्येषु वा साधुषु ज्ञानमाधातुं समर्थो भवति यथा भगवान् व्यासः सं(ज्ञये) जज्ञे ॥३८॥

  *brahma... lābhaḥ* (By acquiring) brahmacarya “aprati...karṣayati” = he causes himself to be free of all obstacles. He acquires unobstructed strength for all activities which are good, i.e., it means that he is not defeated by any kind of opposition.Moreover “vinayeṣu” = to disciples who are worthy or good “jñānam... bhavati” he is capable of imparting knowledge just as Bhagavān Vyāsa was born (to impart knowledge to the worthy).



अपरिग्रहस्थैर्येजन्मकथन्तासंबोधः ॥३९्॥

  When non-covetousness is established there is knowledge of the how of births.

 अस्य भवति।कोऽहमासं, कथमहमासं,किंस्विदिदं,कथंस्विदिदंके वा भविष्यामः,कथं वा भविष्याम इत्येवमस्य पूर्वान्तपरान्तमध्येष्वात्मभावजिज्ञासा स्वरूपेणोपावर्तते।एता यमस्थैर्य सिद्धयः ॥३९॥

  Such a yogī (has this kind of knowledge)—‘Who was I? How was I? What is this (birth) ? How is this (birth) ? What shall we be? How shall we be ? In this way the desire to know of oneself in the past, present and future existences are fulfilled by itself. These are the perfections when the restraints are established.

 अपरिग्रहस्थैर्ये जन्मकथन्तासंबोधः।जन्मनः कथंभावबोधोऽस्य भवति।

  किंस्विदिदं(सम)मम जन्मनः किं सतत्त्वम्, कथं स्विदिदं केन प्रकारेण स्वित्, किं भविष्यामः प्राणो(प्रायणो)त्तरकालं किं वा न भविष्यामः, भविष्यन्तो वा के भविष्यामः,कथं भविष्यामः,इत्येवम् अस्य पूर्वापरान्तमध्येषु भूतभविष्यद्वर्तमानेषु आत्मजिज्ञासा सम्यग्दर्शनस्य पूर्वरूपं स्वरूपेणोपावर्तते।बाह्यपरिग्रहासङ्गाभावात् स्वात्मविषयालोचनमयत्नेन प्रवर्तते।नान्येषां परिग्रहसन्तापवितानिततृषां यत्नेनापि जायते ॥३९्॥

  *aparigraha... bodhaḥ* (such a one) has knowledge of how life comes into being. “kiṃsvididam” = what is the essence of my life; “katham svididam” = in what way did it exist (in the past). “kiṃ bhavisyāmaḥ[^1217]” = after the expiry of prāṇa will we cease to exist or exist; “ke bhaviṣyāmaḥ ...pāvartate” = the desire to know of one's past, future and present (existences), is the first stage in one who has achieved discriminate-discernment. Due to the absence of attachment to any external possession there is spontaneous (effortless) thought on one's own self. As for the others whose greed has expanded, tortured by possessions (this ) does not come about even with (great) effort.

[^1217]: " The bhāsya has “ke vā bhaviṣyāmaḥ” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has the reading “kim bhaviṣyāmah” Later he also quotes it as “ke bhaviṣyāmaḥ”—thus leading to the conclusion that he was not particular about following the text."

 नियमेषु वक्ष्यामः—

 We will now speak of the (perfections with regard to) observances:

शौचात्स्वाङ्गजुगुप्सा परैरसंसर्गः ॥४०॥

 On account of cleanliness there is (a feeling of) disgust towards one's own body and absence of contact with others.

 स्वाङ्गे जुगुप्सायां शौचमारभमाणः कायावद्यदर्शी कायानभिष्वङ्गी यतिर्भवति।किं च परैरसंसर्गः कायस्वभावावलोकी स्वमपि कायं जिहासुर्मृज्जलादिभिराक्षालयन्नपि कायशुद्धिमपश्यन्कथं परकायैरत्यन्तमेवाप्रयतैः संसृज्येत॥

²The "vā" after "katham" is not there in the Vivaraṇa; so also instead of "purväntaparantamadhyeṣvātmabhāvajijñāsā..." the Vivaraṇakṇra has "purvaparantamadhyeṣu ātmajijñāsā...".



  When disgust for one's own body arises, the yogī, observing cleanliness, perceives the defects of the body, becomes unattached to the body and becomes controlled. Moreover, there is lack of contact with others. Having perceived the nature of the body and seeing that the body is not pure even when washed with mud, water, etc., how can he who desires to give up his own body have contact with other such impure bodies?

 यमेषु सिद्धय उक्ताः। इदानीं नियमेषु वक्ष्यामः—शौचात् स्वाङ्गजुगुप्सा परैरसंसर्गः।स्वाङ्गजुगुप्सया शौचमारभमाणः कायावद्यदर्शी शरीरगर्ह्यत्वदर्शी कायानभिष्वङ्गी यतिर्भवति।किञ्च—परैरसंसर्गो भवति।कायस्वभावावलोकी स्वमपि कायं जिहासुर्मृज्जलादिभिराक्षालयन्नपि कायशुद्धिमपश्यन् कथं परकायैरत्यन्तमेवाप्रयतैः संसृज्यत इति ॥४०॥

  The perfections relevant to the restraints have been mentioned. “idānīm... kṣyāmaḥ[^1218]”.*śaucāt... sargaḥ*. “svāṅga... bhavati[^1219]”, i.e., (the yogī) observing the body to be despicable (becomes unattached to the body and controlled) “kiṃca... saṃsṛjyata[^1220]”.

[^1218]: "There is no “idānīm” in the bhāṣya available."

[^1219]: "Instead of “svāṅge jugupsāyām . . .” the Vivaraṇakāra has “svāṅgajugupsayā . . .”."

[^1220]: "The last word in the bhāṣya is“ . . . samsṛjyeta” whereas the Vivaraṇakāra has “ . . . samsṛjyata”. The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything to what the bhāṣya says."

** **किं च—

 Moreover :

सत्त्वशुद्धिसौमनस्यैकाग्र्येन्द्रियजयात्मदर्शनयोग्यत्वानि च ॥४१॥

 (There arise) purification of the mind, pleasantness of feeling,one pointedness,control of the senses and fitness for realising the self.

 भवन्तीति वाक्यशेषः।शुचेः सत्त्वशुद्धिस्ततः सौमनस्यं तत ऐकाग्र्यं तत इन्द्रियजयस्ततश्चात्मदर्शनयोग्यत्वं बुद्धिसत्त्वस्य भवतीत्येतच्छौचस्थैर्यादधिगम्यत इति ॥४१॥

  The words these arise should be added to the (sūtra) sentence. Because of cleanliness, there is purification of the mind, from that comes pleasantness of feeling, thencomes one-pointedness from which arise control of the senses which gives the mind the capacity to realise the self. All this is achieved by the perfection of cleanliness.

 किं चान्यद्भवति।सत्त्वशुद्धिसौमनस्यैकाग्र्येन्द्रियजयात्मदर्शनयोग्यत्वानि चास्य भवन्ति।पूर्वस्य पूर्वस्य स्थैर्यादुत्तरस्याविर्भावः।कथम् ?शुचेः सत्त्वशुद्धिः।ततः सौमनस्यम्,तत ऐकाग्र्यम्,ततश्चेन्द्रियजयः,ततश्चात्मदर्शनयोग्यत्वं बुद्धिसत्त्वस्य भवतीत्यतः शौचस्थैर्यादधिगम्यत एतत् सर्वम्।ततश्चेयं शौचसिद्धिरेव ॥४१॥

 “kiṃca”=something else happens. *sattva...ca*[^1221].Achieving steadiness in the previous states the later stages come into being. How does that happen?[^1222] Due to cleanliness there is purity of mind; then from that there is pleasant feeling; from that one-pointedness, from that control of the senses, from that the capacity to realise oneself

[^1221]: "The Vivaraṇakāra adds asya and bhavanti from the bhāṣya and reads it along with the sūtra."

[^1222]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not bother to explain this but just repeats what the bhāṣya has."



(one's nature) (of the sattva mind comes to be). Thus all this ( is obtained by steadiness in cleanliness). Thus this is the perfection associated with cleanliness.

सन्तोषादनुत्तमः सुखलाभः ॥४२॥

 Because of contentment there is the acquisition of unsurpassed pleasure.

 तथा चोक्तम्—

**यच्च कामसुखं लोके यच्च दिव्यं महत्सुखम् ।  
तृष्णाक्षयसुखस्यैते नार्हतः षोडशीं कलाम् ॥इति॥४२॥**

  Thus it is said ‘Whatever pleasure is derived from desired objects in this world and whatever is the supreme heavenly pleasure they are not equal to a sixteenth part of the pleasure derived by the cessation of desire.’

 सन्तोषादनुत्तमः सुखलाभः।सन्तोषवितर्कानुत्पत्तौ अनुत्तमः न विद्यतेऽस्मादन्य उत्तमः।

 तथा चोक्तम्—“यच्च कामसुखं लोके, यच्चैहिकम्।यच्च दिव्यं महत्सुखम्।देवादिसम्बन्धि।तृष्णाक्षयसुखस्यैते नार्हतः षोडशीं कलाम्” ॥४२॥

  *saṃtoṣa... lābhah* = when there are no opposite thoughts to contentment there is unsurpassed (pleasure). The analysis of the word *anuttamaḥ* is ‘there is no other that surpasses this’.(Thus it is said) “yacca... kalām”,i.e., whatever pleasure there is in this world or associated with the gods (they are not equalto this[^1223]).

[^1223]: "The translation of the verse is not given in full as it has been given already in the bhāṣya."

कायेन्द्रियसिद्धिरशुद्धिक्षयात्तपसः ॥४३॥

  Because of austerity, due to removal of impurities, there is perfection in the body and in the sense-organs.

  निर्वर्त्यमानमेव तपो हिनस्त्यशुद्ध्यावरणमलम्।तदावरणमलापगमात्कायसिद्धिरणिमाद्या।तथेन्द्रियसिद्धिर्दूराच्छ्रवणदर्शनाद्येति ॥४३॥

  Austerities, while being practised, destroy the dirt of the veil of impurity. Then, due to the removal of the veil of dirt, there is perfection in the body such as atomisation &c. Similarly, there is perfection in the sense-organs such as hearing from a distance, seeing from a distance &c., (clairaudience and clairvoyance &c).

 कायेन्द्रियसिद्धिरशुद्धिक्षयात्तपसः।निर्वर्त्यमानमेव तपो हिनस्त्यशुद्ध्यावरणम् किमङ्ग निर्वर्तितमित्यभि(मानः )प्रायः ॥

 तदावरणमलापगमात् कायसिद्धिरणिमाद्या।मातापित्रादिसंबन्धजं कायमलं बैजं गार्भं चाहारादिजं च सर्वं तपसा निघातयिष्यते।ततश्चाणिमादिकायसिद्धिः ॥

 तथा विषयादिसम्पर्कजमिन्द्रियाणामधर्माद्यावरणं मलं तपस्त्रोतस्विनीस्रोतसा क्षाल्यते।तथा इन्द्रियसिद्धिर्दूराच्छ्रवणाद्या ॥४३॥

  *kāyendriya... tapasaḥ* which limb has been (successfully) accomplished (is known from the perfection attained)—that is the idea. “tadāvaraṇa...dyā”, i.e., the impure



body born by the relationship of the mother and father from the seed and the womb nourished by food are all overcome by austerities. As a result there arise perfections like atomisation of the body and so on.

 Similarly the covering of dirt of adharma of the senses which come into being by contact with objects, etc., is washed away by the flow of the river of austerities. “tathā...nādyā” (then there comes into being power of hearing from a distance, etc.).

स्वाध्यायादिष्टदेवतासंप्रयोगः ॥४४॥

 Because of study of the scriptures there is contact with the desired deity.

 देवा ऋषयः सिद्धाश्च स्वाध्यायशीलस्य दर्शनं गच्छन्ति कार्येचास्य वर्तन्त इति ॥४४॥

  Gods, sages and siddhas become visible to him who practises study of the scriptures and help him in fulfilling his work.

 स्वाध्यायादिष्टदेवतासम्प्रयोगः।देवाः ऋषयः सिद्धाश्च य इष्टास्ते स्वाध्यायशीलस्य दर्शनं गच्छन्ति कार्येषु चास्य उपदेशादिषु वर्तन्ते ॥४४॥

  svādhyāyā...gaḥ. “[devāḥ...vartante](http://॑# "The Vivaraṇakāra has the reading “ya iṣtāste” before “svādhyāyaśīlasya” which the bhāṣya does not have. Instead of “kārye cāsya” the Vivaraṇakāra has “kāryesu cāṣya”. The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything to what the bhāṣya states.")” (gods, etc., help him and) advise (him) (who is dedicated to study of the sacred texts).

समाधिसिद्धिरीश्वरप्रणिधानात् ॥४५॥

  Because of devotion to god there is perfection of samādhi.

 ईश्वरार्पितसर्वभावस्य समाधिसिद्धिर्यया सर्वमीप्सितमवितथं जानाति देशान्तरे देहान्तरे कालान्तरे च।ततोऽस्य प्रज्ञा यथाभूतं जानातीति ॥४५॥

  There is perfection of samādhi in the yogi who has dedicated his entire being to god. By this he knows all that he desires to know, as it is in truth, in other places, in different bodies and at different times. Thereafter his insight knows (things) as they are in truth.

  समाधिसिद्धिरीश्वरप्रणिधानात्।ईश्वरार्पितसर्वभावस्य समाधिः सिध्यति।यया समाधिसिद्ध्या सर्वमीप्सितमवितथं जानाति।तथा देशान्तरे कालान्तरे चास्य प्रज्ञा यथाभूतं जानाति ॥४५॥

 *samādhi...nāt.* “īśvara...siddhyati[^1224]”“yayā” = by the perfection of samādhi (he knows everything he wantsto know[^1225]...).

[^1224]: "Instead of “samādhisiddhiḥ” the Vivaraṇakāra has “samādhiḥ siddhyati”. TheVivaraṇakāra does not add anything new to this line."

[^1225]: "The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything new to the bhāṣya. The Vivaraṇakāra has the reading . . . tathā deśāntare kālāntare cāsya prajñā yathābhūtam jānāti” instead of “ . . . deśāntare dehāntare kālāntare ca tato’sya prajñā yathābhūtam jānātīti”."

 उक्ताः सह सिद्धिभिर्यमनियमाः।आसनादीनि वक्ष्यामः।तत्र—

 The yamas and niyamas along with their perfections have been mentioned. We will now speak of posture &c. Amongst these:



स्थिरसुखमासनम् ॥४६॥

 Posture is steady and comfortable.

 तद्यथा पद्मासनं भद्रासनं वीरासनं स्वस्तिकं दण्डासनं सोपाश्रयं पर्यङ्कं क्रौञ्चनिषदनं हस्तिनिषदनमुष्ट्रनिषदनं समसंस्थानं स्थिरसुखं यथासुखं चेत्येवमादीनि ॥४६॥

  Thus, for example, the padmāsana, the bhadrāsana, the vīrāsana, the svastika, the daṇḍāsana, the sopāśraya,the paryaṅka,the krauñca-niṣadana,the hasti-niṣadana,the uṣṭra-niṣadana,the samasaṃsthāna and others of the same kind which can be practised comfortably, (is) steady and comfortable.

 उक्ताः सह सिद्धिभिर्यमनियमाः।इदानीं आसनादीनि वक्ष्यामः—तत्र स्थिरसुखमासनम्।स्थिरं सुखं चासनम्। यस्मिन्नासने स्थितस्य मनोगात्राणामुपजायते स्थिरत्वम्,दुःखं च येन न भवति तदभ्यस्येत्।तद्यथा—शास्त्रान्तरप्रसिद्धानि नामानि पद्मासनादीनि प्रदर्श्यन्ते ॥

 तत्र शुचौ देवनिलयगिरिगुहानदीपुलिनादौ ज्वलनसलिलासमीपे जन्तुविवर्जिते निर(ङ्ग)श्मके शुचिः सम्यगाचम्य, परमेश्वरमखिलभुवनैकनाथं अभिवन्द्यांश्च योगेश्वरानात्मगुरूंश्च प्रणिपत्य,चैलाजिनकुशोत्तरमदुःखकरं प्राङ्मुख उदङ्मुखो वा विष्टरमधिष्ठाय,अन्यतमदेषामासनं निर्बध्नीयात् ॥

 “uktāḥ...māḥ”. Now “asana...vakṣyāmaḥ”—tatra” *sthira...nam* = Posture is both steady and comfortable. One should practise that posture, in the practice of which posture there is steadiness of both the mind and the body and through which there is also no pain. Thus “tadyathā...”and so on, i.e., he describes (the lotus posture and others) which are the names well-known in the sacred texts.

 Therein, in places like an abode of the gods (temple), mountain, cave, river bank, sand bank, not close to water or fire, free of insects, free of stones, sipping pure water, bowing down to the Almighty Lord, the one God of the Universe and also bowing to the great yogīs and one's gurus, sitting on a seat of cloth, on a deer skin, over a cluster of grass which does not cause pain (discomfort), facing either the east or the north, one should fix oneself in anyone of the following postures.

 तत्र पद्मासनं नाम—सव्यं पादमुपसंहृत्य दक्षिणोपरि निदधीत।तथैव दक्षिणं सव्यस्योपरिष्टयत्।कट्युरोग्रीवं च विष्टभ्य,मृ(ग)तसुप्तवन्नासिकाग्रनिहितदृष्टिः,समुद्रकवदपिहितोष्ठसम्पुटः,दन्तैर्दन्ताग्रमपरामृशन्,मुष्टिमात्रान्तरविप्रकृष्टचिबुकोरस्स्थलः, राजद्दन्तान्तरनिहितरसनाग्रः, हस्तौ पायरुपरि कच्छपकं ब्रह्माञ्जलिं वा कृत्वा,सकृदास्थापितेत्थं संस्थानः, पुनः पुनः शरीरावयवशरीरविन्यासविशेषपरित्यक्तप्रयत्नः सन् येनासीत, तत् पद्मासनम् ॥

 एतच्च सर्वमन्येषामासनानामपि तुल्यम्।कश्चिदेव विशेषः ॥

 तथा दक्षिणं पादं सव्यस्योपरि कृत्वा,हस्तं च दक्षिणं सव्यहस्तस्योपरि निधाय येनास्ते, तत् भद्रासनम्।अन्यत् समानम् ॥

 Therein,that called padmāsana is (as follows)—drawing the left foot one should place it over the right; similarly the right foot (should be placed) over the left. Keeping steady the hip, chest and neck like one dead or in deep sleep, fixing the gaze on the tip of the nose, like a covered box with the lips not tightly closed, without touching (one row of) the tips of the teeth with (the measure of ) just one fist, fixing the tongue in between the (other) teeth, with the chin separated from the chest with front



teeth, holding the hands in either the (representation of ) the tortoise or folded together over the heels, having sat steadily like this once, when one can sit without any effort in the special position of the body and the various parts of the body repeatedly this is the posture called “padmāsana[^1226]”. And this is similar to all other postures as well—there are only slight differences.

[^1226]: "It is difficult to believe that Śaṅkara would have gone to such great lengths to describe these postures."

 Thus when one sits down placing the right foot on top of the left, and the right hand on top of the left hand that is (called) “bhadrāsanam”. The rest are common (to the padmāsana).

 तथा कुञ्चितान्यतरपादमवनिविन्यस्तापरजानुकं वीरासनम् । उच्यमान एव विशेषः सर्वत्र ॥

 दक्षिणं पादाङ्गुष्ठं सव्येनोरुजङ्घेन परिगृह्यादृश्यं कृत्वा, तथा सव्यं पादाङ्गुष्ठं दक्षिणेनोरुजङ्घेनादृश्यं परिगृह्य, यथा च पार्ष्णिभ्यां वृष्णयोरपीडनं तथा येनास्ते, तत् स्वस्तिकमासनम् ॥

 समगुल्फौ समाङ्गुष्ठौ प्रसारयन् समजानू पादौ दण्डवद्येनोपविशेत् तत् दण्डासनम् ॥

  (न) योगपट्टसं (स्थं) स्तम्भाद्याश्रयं वा सोपाश्रयम् ॥

 आजानुप्रसारितबाहुशयनं पर्यङ्कासनम् ॥

 क्रौञ्चनिषदनं हस्तिनिषदनं उष्ट्रनिषदनं च कौञ्चादिनिषदनसंन्थानसादृश्यादेव द्रष्टव्यम् ॥

 भूमौ न्यस्तोरुजङ्घं समसंस्थितम् ॥

 स्थितप्रस्रब्धिः।अन्येनापि प्रकारेण स्वयमुत्प्रेक्ष्य स्थितप्रस्त्रब्धिः।अनायासो येन भवति तदप्यासनं स्थितप्रस्त्रब्धिर्नाम ॥

 यथासुखं च—येन रूपेणासीनस्य सुखं भवति तत् यथासुखम् । आदिशब्दादन्यदपि यथाचार्योपदिष्टमासनं द्रष्टव्यम् ॥४६॥

  Similarly, when one of the feet is placed bent on the knee of the other foot placed on the ground that is “vīrāsanam”. Everywhere what is mentioned is only the difference.

 Holding the right toe with the wide upper part of the left leg without it being seen and similarly holding the toe of the left foot without it being seen with the wide upper part of the right leg, and when there is no pain to the scrotum (testicles) caused by the heels—one who sits thus is called ( sitting in ) the posture of “svastika”.

 Stretching and keeping even the ankles and the toes and the knees and legs even, one who can stay like a staff that is known as staying in “daṇḍāsanam”.

 That which has support like a yogic table or a staff is “[sopāśrayam](http://॑# "The literal meaning is only that with support. For more details see Rukmani, op. cit., vol. II, p. 219 and p. 219n.")”.

 Lying with arms spread reaching the knees is “paryaṅkāsanam”.

 The resemblance to the sitting postures of a krauñca, etc., should be noted in “krauñcaniṣadanam . . . ” and so on.


“samasamsthitam[^1227]” is when the chest and knees touch (are placed on) the ground. “sthitaprasrabdhiḥ[^1228]”, i.e., any other (posture) through which one binds oneself steady is “sthita... ”. Any posture which can be done without any difficulty is also the posture known as “sthitaprasrabdhiḥ” “yathāsukham ca” = in the form in which it is

[^1227]: "The bhāṣya has “samasthānam” instead of “samasaṃsthitam”."

[^1228]: "Instead of “sthirasukham” the Vivaraṇakāra has “sthitaprasrabdhiḥ”."



comfortable for one seated, that is known as “yathā...”. By the use of the word “ādi” (etc.) one should understand any other posture which has been taught by the teacher.

प्रयत्नशैथिल्यानन्त्यसमापत्तिभ्याम् ॥४७॥

 By relaxation of effort or by attaining oneness in meditation with the infinite (posture is attained).

 भवतीति वाक्यशेषः।प्रयत्नोपरमात्सिध्यत्यासनं येन नाङ्गमेजयो भवति।अनन्ते वा समापन्नं चित्तमासनं निर्वर्तयतीति ॥४७॥

  The (sūtra) sentence is completed by adding the words ‘is attained’. By relaxation of effort the āsana is perfected by which there is no trembling of the body. Or when the mind attains oneness in meditation with the infinite it brings about the āsana.

 तदासनजयाभ्युपाय इदानीमुपपाद्यते—प्रयत्नशैथिल्यानन्त्यसमापत्तिभ्याम्।भवतीति वाक्यशेषः
आसनं दृढनिष्पन्नं भवतीत्युपस्कारः।प्रयत्नोपरमादासनबन्धोत्तरकालं प्रयत्नाकरणाद्वा सिध्यति।येन नाङ्गमेजयो भवति।येन प्रयत्नोपरमेण।प्रयत्नेन ह्यङ्गं कम्पयति।येन अचलितासनो भवतीत्यर्थः आनन्त्ये वा समापन्नम्।अनन्तं विश्वम्, अनन्तभाव आनन्त्यम्, तस्मिन् समापन्नं, व्याप्य विश्वभावं स्थितं चित्तमासनं निर्वर्तयति द्रढयति ॥४७॥

 Having attained proficiency (victory) in posture he now points out [*prayatna...ttibhyām*](http://॑# "The sūtra also reads prayatnaśaithilyānantasamāpattibhyām instead of prayatnaśaithilyānantyasamāpattibhyām.").“*bhavatī...*”, i.e., it is added that the posture gets well accomplished. “prayatno...”, i.e., after getting settled in the posture it is obtained without any more effort. “yena...bhavati”; “yena” = by cessation of effort; due to effort the limbs shiver; (by relaxation) one attains steadiness in posture. “ānantye...pannam” = the universe is endless; the state of being endless is “ānantyam”. Meditating (becoming one with that state), i.e., when the mind staying in that expanded universal state “cittam...vartayati” it (the posture) is strengthened.

ततो द्वन्द्वानभिघातः ॥४८॥

 Thereafter he is not troubled by the opposites.

** **शीतोष्णादिभिर्द्वन्द्वैरासनजयान्नाभिभूयते ॥४८॥

 Because of mastering the āsana he is not overcome by the opposites like cold and heat.

 ततो द्वन्द्वानभिघातः। ततः आसनस्थिरीभावात्।इदं दृष्टमानुषाङ्गिकम्।यत् शीतोष्णादिभिर्द्वन्द्वैर्नाभिभूयते ॥४८॥

* tato dvandvānabhighātaḥ tataḥ* = by gaining steadiness in posture, one has observed the following connection, i.e. “sītoṣṇa...bhūyate” (the opposites do not overcome him).



तस्मिन्सति श्वासप्रश्वासयोर्गतिविच्छेदः प्राणायामः ॥४९॥

 When perfection in the āsana is achieved then comes regulation of breath which is suspension of movement of inhalation and exhalation.

 सत्यासनजये बाह्यस्य वायोराचमनं श्वासः।कौष्ठ्यस्य वायोर्निःसारणं प्रश्वासः।तयोर्गतिविच्छेद उभयाभावः प्राणायामः ॥४९॥

 The taking in of outside air is inhalation.The throwing out of air in the stomach is exhalation.When āsana is achieved,the suspension of the movement of these two or the absence of both,is regulation of breath.

  किञ्च—प्राणायामादियोग्यता च भवति।कथम् ? तस्मिन् सति श्वासप्रश्वासयोर्गतिविच्छेदः प्राणायामः। सत्यासने दृढे बाह्यस्य वायोराचमनं श्वासः।यथा सन्ततत्वादुदकं नालेनाकृष्यते, तथा सन्ततत्वात् नासिकापुटनालाभ्यामपानवायुसंबन्धो बहिर्वायुराकृष्यते, तदाकर्षणं श्वासः।तथा कौष्ठ्यवायोर्निश्चारणम्।प्राणवृत्तिसम्बन्धो हि कौष्ठ्यो वायुः।तस्य बहिर्निस्सारणं प्रश्वासः।तयोर्गतिविच्छेदः।किमुक्तं भवत्यत आह—उभयाभावः प्राणायाम इति ॥४९॥

 Moreover one becomes capable of performing prāṇāyāma, etc. How does that happen? *tasmin sati ... yāmaḥ*. “satya...śvāsaḥ[^1229]”. Just as water is drawn through a lotus stalk by its continued presence so also, by continued presence, through the nostrils (openings of the nose) the outside air connected with apāna[^1230]air is drawn in, that drawing in is inhalation. Similarly “kauṣṭhya...[^1231] ” = the abdominal air is connected with the activity of prāna; throwing it out is “praśvāsaḥ” (exhalation) “tayor...cchedaḥ” = what is said regarding it—he answers “ubhayā...yāmah” (the absence of both is prāṇāyāma).

[^1229]: "Instead of “satyāsanajaye . . . ” the Vivaraṇakāra has “satyāsane dṛḍhe . . . ”."

[^1230]: "The five types being apāna, udāna, samāna, vyāna, prāṇa."

[^1231]: "Instead of “kauṣṭhyasya vāyornissāraṇam” the Vivaraṇakāra has “kauṣṭhyavāyorniścāraṇam”."

 स तु—

 And this—

बाह्याभ्यन्तरस्तम्भवृत्तिर्देशकालसंख्याभिः परिदृष्टो दीर्घसूक्ष्मः ॥५०॥

 Has an external activity,an internal activity, (and) a suppressed activity.When observed according to space,time and number it becomes of long duration and subtle.

 यत्र प्रश्वासपूर्वको गत्यभावः स बाह्यः।यत्र श्वासपूर्वको गत्यभावः स आभ्यन्तरः।तृतीयः स्तम्भवृत्तिर्यत्रोभयाभावः सकृत्प्रयत्नाद्भवति।यथा तप्ते न्यस्तमुपले जलं सर्वतः संकोचमापद्यते तथा द्वयोर्युगपद्गत्यभाव इति।त्रयोऽप्येते देशेन परिदृष्टा इयानस्य विषयो देश इति।कालेन परिदृष्टाः क्षणानामियत्तावधारणेनावच्छिन्ना इत्यर्थः।संख्याभिः परिदृष्टा एतावद्भिः श्वासप्रश्वासैः प्रथम उद्धातस्तद्वन्निगृहीतस्यैतावद्भिर्द्वितीय उद्धात एवं तृतीयः एवं मृदुरेवं मध्य एवं तीव्र इति संख्यापरिदृष्टः।स खल्वयमेवमभ्यस्तो दीर्घसूक्ष्मः ॥५०॥






 Where there is absence of movement after exhalation that is external (activity). Where there is absence of movement after inhalation that is internal (activity). Where there is absence of both kinds is the third kind of suppressed activity. This is achieved by a single effort. Just as water dropped on a red-hot stone shrinks from all sides similarly, there is absence of both simultaneously (in the third). All these three are observed (1) according to space; as this much space is its scope; they are observed (2) according to time, i.e., they are measured by determining the moments of duration; they are observed (3) according to number, i.e., through so many inhalations and exhalations the first udghāta (stroke) is measured. Similarly, the second stroke of one who has control (over the first) is through so many (inhalations and exhalations); similarly, the third (stroke). Again they are observed as mild, as moderate and as intense; this is prāṇāyāma observed according to number. This practised in these (many) ways becomes of long duration and subtle.

 “sa tu” = (That) (prāṇāyāma) is of three kinds.*bāhyābhyan... sūkṣmaḥ*.It has an external activity,an internal activity and a suppressed activity.“yatra... bāhyavṛttiḥ[^1232]”,i.e.,the activity concerned with forcing the outside air inside is external activity. Therefore it is external. Some others call external as pūraka. “yatra ... vṛttiḥ[^1233]”,i.e., the activity concerned with expelling the internal air outside is the internal activity. “tasmāt... ābhyantaraḥ”[^1234]. That is called recaka (by some)[^1235].

[^1232]: " Instead of “yatra praśvāsapūrvako gatyabhāvaḥ sa bāhyaḥ” the Vivaraṇakāra has “yatra śvāsapūrvako gatyabhāvaḥ sa bāhyavṛttiḥ”."

[^1233]: "Here too the Vivaraṇakāra has “praśvāsapūrvako” for “śvāsapūrvako” and “ābhyantaravṛttiḥ” for “ābhyantaraḥ”."

[^1234]: "This is not found in the readings available."

[^1235]: " It is interesting to note that Miśra and other commentators call these as pūraka and recaka. Śaṅkara does not seem to use these terms. And it is also possible that the Vivaraṇakāra is referring to Miśra by the word “anya” here."

  “tr̥tiya ... prabhavati[^1236]”

[^1236]: "Instead of “tṛtīyaḥ” the Vivaraṇakāra has “tṛtīyastu”. Instead of “yatrobhayābhāvaḥ” the Vivaraṇakāra has “tatrobhayābhāvaḥ”. Instead of “bhavati” the Vivaraṇakāra has “pṛabhavati”."

 “yathā... āpadyate”, i.e., (just as water poured on a red hot stone shrinks from all sides similarly with one effort activities of prāṇa, etc., get restricted; so he says “dvayo... iti” (there is absence of both activities at once).



 “trayo...deśa iti[^1237]”,i.e., the internal inhalation of the external activity spreads from the tip of the nose to the toes of the feet. Similarly, the external exhalation of air of the internal activity spreads from the toes of the feet up to the tip of the nose.The suppressed activity spreads (all over) from the top of the head to the soles of the feet. Or externally there is pervasion of space measured in terms of a vitasti[^1238]and so on.

[^1237]: "After “iyānasya” the word “viṣayo” is not found in the Vivaraṇa."

[^1238]: "Vitasti is a measure denoting the distance between the extended thumb and little finger."

 तथा वायूनां दीर्घत्वमन्दत्वापत्तेः सूक्ष्मं च भवति॥२०॥

 “kālena...”, i.e, so many moments have been spent by prāṇāyāma[^1239].“tathā...udghātaḥ[^1240]”, i.e.,(the first stroke) is observed by the (number of exhalations and inhalations) gone by; for instance the first stroke is when the air agitated by restraint escapes after reaching the top of the head; “sa eva mṛduḥ”( that is mild).

[^1239]: "Count by time."

[^1240]: "The sentence does not begin with “tathā” in the bhāṣya."

 Again when the air, which escaped once, is restrained by (that many) past exhalations it is observed (as the second stroke); it is called the (middling) prāṇāyāma. Similarly “tṛtīyaḥ” (the third)”; the one observed by this many exhalations and inhalations is the “tṛtīya...” (third stroke). And this third stroke is “tīvra (intense) “sa khalva...” when (prāṇāyāma) is practised, keeping in view (observing) space, time and count, it extends over a lengthened period of time, because of victory gained in that stage. Thus it is heard that ṛṣis could stay for a number of years (in that state). Therefore it is called “dīrghaḥ” (long). Similarly, since the airs extend for long periods and are slow, it (prāṇāyāma) is also called “sūkṣma” (subtle).

बाह्याभ्यन्तरविषयाक्षेपी चतुर्थः॥५१॥

 The fourth (prāṇāyāma) transcends (extends over) the spheres of both the external and internal (prāṇāyāma).

 देशकालसंख्याभिर्बाह्यविषयपरिदृष्ट आक्षिप्तः।तथाभ्यन्तरविषयपरिदृष्ट आक्षिप्तः।उभयथा दीर्घसूक्ष्मः।तत्पूर्वको भूमिजयात्क्रमेणोभयोर्गत्यभावश्चतुर्थः प्राणायामः।तृतीयस्तु विषयानालोचितो गत्यभावः सकृदारब्ध एव, देशकालसंख्याभिः परिदृष्टो दीर्घसूक्ष्मः।चतुर्थस्तु श्वासप्रश्वासयोर्विषयावधारणात्क्रमेण भूमिजयादुभयाक्षेपपूर्वको गत्यभावश्चतुर्थः प्राणायाम इत्ययं विशेषः इति॥५१॥

 The sphere of the external (prāṇāyāma) observed with regard to space, time and number is (then) transcended Similarly the sphere of the internal (prāṇāyāma



observed with regard to space, time and number is transcended. In both cases, it is of long duration and subtle. Following these and by gradually conquering that stage, the suspension of movement (of breath) is the fourth prāṇāyāma.

 In the third kind of suspension of movement (of breath) the sphere is not considered, it is accomplished by one single effort, it is observed with reference to space, time and number, it is of long duration and subtle. Whereas the fourth comes into being gradually after determining the spheres of inhalation and exhalation and conquering that stage; the fourth prāṇāyāma is a suspension of movement of breath after transcending both the (earlier) spheres. Thus this is the difference (between the third and fourth prāṇāyāma).

 बाह्याभ्यन्तरविषयाक्षेपी चतुर्थः—बाह्यस्य विषयाः पादाङ्गुष्ठादयः।बाह्यो हि वायुराचम्यमानोऽन्तर्देशान् व्याप्नोति, आक्षिपति। आभ्यन्तरस्य विषया भूम्यादयः।स च बहिर्निश्चार्यमाणो भूम्यादीन् देशकालसङ्ख्यापरिदृष्टान् व्याप्नोति, आक्षिपति।स बाह्याभ्यन्तरविषयाक्षेपी चतुर्थः प्राणायामः॥

 *bāhyābhyan...caturthaḥ*;the sphere of the external (prāṇāyāma) are the toes of the feet, etc., the external air being inhaled pervades the internal spaces, overcomes (the spaces). The spheres of the internal (prāṇāyāma ) are the earth, etc. And that being thrown out (exhaled) pervades earth, etc., observed through space, time and count; i.e.overcomes (earth), etc. That *bāhya...caturthaḥ*[^1241](is the fourth which transcends both the external and internal prāṇāyāma).

[^1241]: "Instead of “ . . . bāhyaviṣayaparidrṣṭaḥ ākṣiptaḥ” the Vivaraṇakāra has “bāhyavastuviṣayaḥ paridrṣṭa ākṣiptaḥ”."

 “deśakāla...ptaḥ”,i.e., (the first called external)...is pervaded. “tathā...ākṣiptaḥ[^1242]” (the internal observed through space, time, etc.) is pervaded. “ubhayathā...” = in both cases by transcending the external and internal spheres, it is long and subtle.

[^1242]: "Instead of “ . . . ābhyantaraviṣayaparidrṣṭa” the Vivaraṇakāra has “ābhyantaraviṣayaḥ paridrṣṭaḥ”."

 Question — What is said in this connection?

 Answer—“tatpūrvakaḥ...caturthaḥ”, i.e., preceded by pervasion of the two (external and internal) spheres, conquering in order, the stages of operation of the two external and internal airs—prāṇa and apāna (the suspension of breath is the fourth). Since there is a similarity in the activity of the two, the third and the fourth (prāṇāyāma) raising the doubt of any distinction between them he says—“tṛtīyas...eva[^1243]” (i.e., it is suspension brought about in one movement); “caturthastu . .
.viśesaḥ[^1244]”,

[^1243]: "Instead of “tṛtīyastu . . . nālocita gatyabhāvaḥ . . . ” the Vivaraṇakāra has “tṛtīyastad . . .”. The Vivaraṇakāra also does not explain anything more than what is given in the bhāṣya."

[^1244]: "Instead of “ . . . bhūmijayādubhayā . . .” the Vivaraṇakāra has “ . . . bhūmijayakrameṇobhayā . . . ”. Here again the Vivaraṇakāra hardly adds anything to what the bhāṣya says."



i.e., (the fourth) goes beyond (inhalation and exhalation) both limited and unlimited, or (gradually determining) whatever is the activity, then conquering those stages, and transcending both spheres, the suspension of breath is the fourth (prāṇāyāma); (this is the difference) between the third and fourth (prāṇāyāmas).

ततः क्षीयते प्रकाशावरणम् ॥५२॥

 Then the veil, covering the light (of knowledge) is weakened.

 प्राणायामानभ्यस्यतोऽस्य योगिनः क्षीयते विवेकज्ञानावरणीयं कर्म।यत्तदाचक्षते—महामोहमयेनेन्द्रजालेन प्रकाशशीलं सत्त्वमावृत्य तदेवाकार्ये विनियुङ्क्ते इति।तदस्य प्रकाशावरणं कर्म संसारनिबन्धनं प्राणायामाभ्यासबलाद् दुर्बलं भवति प्रतिक्षणं च क्षीयते।तथा चोक्तम्—तपो न परं प्राणायामात्ततो विशुद्धिर्मलानां दीप्तिश्च ज्ञानस्येति ॥५२॥

 In the case of that yogi who is practising prāṇāyāma, karma which covers discriminate-discernment is weakened. That is described as follows—‘By the magical net of great delusion sattva, which is of the nature of light, is hidden and is made to accomplish improper deeds.’ That karma which binds him to saṃsāra and which covers this light loses its strength by the practice of prāṇāyāma and is weakened from moment to moment. In this connection it has been said—There is no greater austerity than prāṇāyāma; from that comes purification of defects and shining of knowledge.

 ततः क्षीयते प्रकाशावरणम्।प्रकाश आव्रियते येन तत् प्रकाशावरणं कर्म।प्राणायामानभ्यस्यतो योगिनो विवेकज्ञानमाव्रियते येन तत् विवेकज्ञानावरणीयं कर्म।यत्तु आचक्षते शास्त्रान्तरे “महामोहमयेनेन्द्रजालेन प्रकाशशीलं सत्त्वमावृत्य तदेवाकार्ये विनियुङ्क्ते” इति ॥

 तथा चोक्तम्—‘न परं प्राणायामात्तपः’ इति।तस्मात् ततः प्राणायामात् रजस्तमःकार्याणां विशुद्धिर्मलानां, दीप्तिश्च ज्ञानस्येति ॥५२॥

 *tataḥ kṣīyate prakāśāvaraṇam*; that by which the light (of knowledge) is covered is the covering of light, i.e., it is the object (of action). “prāṇāyāma...” and so on, i.e., that by which the discriminating knowledge is covered is “viveka...karma”.“[yattu ācakṣate](http://॑# "Instead of “yattadācakṣate” the Vivaraṇakāra has “yattu ācakṣate”.")” = this is mentioned in an allied sacred text (as follows) “mahā... viniyuṅkte”, i.e., that which envelops by the wide net of misapprehension, that sattva itself, through the act of covering, is engaged in all wrong deeds. “tat prāṇādurbalam bhavati[^1245]”, i.e., not only does it lose its strength but “pratikṣaṇam...te” (it is weakened moment by moment).

[^1245]: "Instead of “tadasya . . . bhavati” the Vivaraṇakāra has “tatprāṇāyāmābhyāsādasya . . . bhavati”."

 Thus it is said—“na param...tapaḥ[^1246]”,i.e., “tataḥ...māt” = because of that

[^1246]: "The order is different in the Vivaraṇa. Instead of “tapo na param prāṇāyāmāt” the Vivaraṇakāra has “na param prānāyāmāt tapaḥ”."



(prāṇāyāma) there is purification of the effects (defects) of rajas and tamas (and shining of knowledge).

 किं च—

 Moreover—

धारणासु च योग्यता मनसः ॥५३॥

 The mind becomes fit for concentration.

 प्राणायामाभ्यासादेव, प्रच्छर्दनविधारणाभ्यां वा प्राणस्य इति वचनात् ॥५३॥

 Through the practice of prāṇāyāma alone (the mind becomes fit for dhāraṇā). This is understood by the statement ‘or through the expulsion and retention of breath,’ stability of mind comes about (I.34).

 किं च—भवत्यन्यदपि प्राणायामाभ्यासात्।धारणासु वक्ष्यमाणासु योग्यता मनसः प्राणायामादेव।‘प्रच्छर्दनविधारणाभ्यां वा प्राणस्य’ इति वचनात् ताभ्यां हि मनसः स्थितिसम्पत्तिरुक्ता ॥५३॥

 “kiṃca”—Moreover there is something else that comes about by the practice of [prāṇāyāma.](http://॑# "The sūtra reads dhāraṇāsu ca yogyatā manasaḥ but the Vivaraṇa has dhāraṇāsu yogyatā manasaḥ prānāyāmādeva. It appears that the Vivaraṇakāra is combining the sūtra with part of the beginning of the bhāṣya.") *[dhāraṇāsu](http://॑# "The sūtra reads dhāraṇāsu ca yogyatā manasaḥ but the Vivaraṇa has dhāraṇāsu yogyatā manasaḥ prānāyāmādeva. It appears that the Vivaraṇakāra is combining the sūtra with part of the beginning of the bhāṣya.")*...By the statement *pracchardana...prāṇasya*[^1247]the steadiness of the mind is mentioned as obtained by the two (exhalation and retention of breath..., i.e., prāṇāyāma).

[^1247]: "YS, I.34."

 अथ कः प्रत्याहारः ?

 Now what is pratyāhāra ?

स्वविषयासंप्रयोगे चित्तस्वरूपानुकार इवेन्द्रियाणां प्रत्याहारः ॥५४॥

  When the sense-organs do not come in contact with their (respective) objects and appear to be imitating the nature of the mind it is called pratyāhāra (withdrawal of sense-organs).

  स्वविषयसंप्रयोगाभावे चित्तस्वरूपानुकार इवेति चित्तनिरोधे चित्तवन्निरुद्धानीन्द्रियाणि नेतरेन्द्रियजयवदुपायान्तरमपेक्षन्ते।यथा मधुकरराजं मक्षिका उत्पतन्तमनुत्पतन्ति निविशमानमनुनिविशन्ते तथेन्द्रियाणि चित्तनिरोधे निरुद्धानीत्येष प्रत्याहारः ॥५४॥

 It means that, due to absence of contact with their objects they (the senses) appear to imitate the nature of the mind; when the mind is restricted the senses (also) are restricted like the mind. Yogīs (therefore) do not need to apply other means like other theories of control of the senses. Just as the bees fly when the king-bee flies and sits when it sits so also the sense-organs are restricted when the mind is restricted. This is pratyāhāra.



 अथ कः प्रत्याहारः ? प्रत्याहारविशेषमभिधित्समानः प्रश्नेनोपक्रमते स्वविषयादिन्द्रियाणां प्रत्याहरणमात्रं परेषां प्रत्याहारः।अत्र पुनर्विशेषवानुच्यते स्वविषयासम्प्रयोगे चित्तस्य स्वरूपानुकार इवेन्द्रियाणां प्रत्याहार इति ।

  “atha kaḥ pratyāhāraḥ”, i.e., with a desire to mention the speciality of pratyāhāra (withdrawal of the sense-organs) he starts off with a question. For others “pratyāhāra" is just withdrawal of the sense-organs from their respective sense-objects. But here the special pratyāhāra is mentioned as *svaviṣaya...pratyāhāra*. “[svaiḥ...nukārateva](http://॑# "The Vivaraṇakāra has “svaiḥ svaiśśabdādibhirviṣayaiḥ saṃyogābhāve cittasvarūpānukārateva” instead of “svaviṣayasaṃprayogābhāve cittasvarūpānukāra iveti”.")”,i.e., when the senses such as the ear, etc., of the yogīs withdraw (themselves) from their respective sense-objects because of perceiving the defects in the objects, the form that the mind of the yogī takes on, is an imitation as it were of the nature of the mind.

 (In that connection) it is said—“cittanirodhe...pekṣante[^1248]”, i.e., for the restraint (of the sense-organs) (the yogīs need not resort to any other means). By the restraint of the mind itself they (the senses) are restrained. “yathā...[^1249]”=this is a statement of śruti and means madhukararājam (the king bee) “makṣikā...pratyāhāraḥ[^1250]”.

[^1248]: "Instead of “citta . . . netarendriyajayavadupāyāntaram . . .” the Vivaraṇakāra has “citta . . . nopāyāntaram . . .”."

[^1249]: "Grammatically it should be ‘madhukararājam’ which is what is found in the present-day text. But the Vivaranakāra has “madhukararājānam” which therefore is an archaic usage."

[^1250]: " The Vivaraṇakāra does not add anything new to what the bhāṣya states."

ततः परमा वश्यतेन्द्रियाणाम् ॥५५॥

 From that (pratyāhāra) the highest control of the sense-organs.

 शब्दादिष्वव्यसनमिन्द्रियजय इति केचित्।सक्तिर्व्यसनं व्यस्यत्येनं श्रेयस इति।अविरुद्धा प्रतिपत्तिर्वा न्याय्यः।शब्दादिसंप्रयोगः स्वेच्छयेत्यन्ये।रागद्वेषाभावे सुखदुःखशून्यं शब्दादिज्ञानमिन्द्रियजय इति केचित्।चित्तैकाग्र्यादप्रतिपत्तिरेवेति जैगीषव्यः।ततश्च परमा त्वियं वश्यता यच्चित्तनिरोधे निरुद्धानीन्द्रियाणि नेतरेन्द्रियजयवत्प्रयत्नकृतमुपायान्तरमपेक्षन्ते योगिन इति ॥५५॥

 इति श्रीपातञ्जलयोगसूत्रभाष्ये श्रीमद्वेदव्यासकृते द्वितीयः साधनपादः ॥

 (1)Some say that non-attachment to objects such as sound &c., is control of the senses. (The word) vyasana means attachment, because it separates one from what is good. That enjoyment of sense-objects which is not prohibited in the śāstras is legitimate (and this is control of senses). (2) Others say that contact with sense-objects such as sound &c., (only) when one desires (without being their slave) (is control of the senses). (3) Still others are of the opinion that, knowledge of sound &c., without



the feeling of either pleasure or pain, in the absence of attachment and aversion, is control of the senses. (4) Jaigīsavya thinks that it is lack of activity (of the senses) due to one-pointedness of the mind. Because of this it is the highest form of control. For here, when the mind is restricted, the sense-organs are restricted; therefore, yogis do not need to employ other means like other theories of control of the senses.

 Thus in the (commentary of Vyāsa) on the Yogaśāstra of Patañjali (this is) the second Pāda (quarter) on Sādhana.

  ततः प्रत्याहारस्थैर्यात् परमा वश्यतेन्द्रियाणां भवति।इतिशब्दः समाप्त्यर्थः।यासां च वश्यतानां मध्ये प्रत्याहारस्थैर्यात् परमा वश्यता जायते ता उच्यन्ते—

  tataḥ = by gaining stability in pratyāhāra, *paramā vaśyatendriyāṇām* there is (the highest control of sense-organs). The word iti denotes the end. Those various (sense) controls amongst which that supreme control which comes into being through stability of pratyāhāra are now mentioned. “[śabdādi... kecidāhuḥ](http://॑# " The Vivaraṇakāra has “śabdadiṣvindriyajayaḥ avyasanam kecidāhuḥ” instead of “śabdādiṣvavyasanamindriyajaya iti kecit”. It appears that the Vivaraṇakāra paraphrases the bhāṣya in his own words without meticulously maintaining the order of the words in the bhāṣya.")”, i.e.,it is repeated inactivity or (repeated) non-attachment (to sense-objects) (according to some). He further explains the word “vyasanam” as “sakti... nam” (attachment). How is that so? “vyasya... śreyasaḥ” = it removes him, who gains it, from what is good.

 “aviruddhā...”or sense control is non-attachment towards sense-objects like sound, etc., which are prohibited (according to śāstra) ; that is again explained as “nyayyaḥ... manvate[^1251]”, i.e., with regard to those which are allowed by the śāstras (and) not prohibited, one follows or not follows what one desires[^1252].

[^1251]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has “nyāyyaḥ śabdādiṣu saṃyogaḥ svecchayā ityevamanye manvate” instead of “nyāyyaḥ Sabdādisaṃprayogaḥ svecchayetyanye”."

[^1252]: " This is to indicate control over one's senses even in the case of those allowed by śāstras."

“rāga...jñānam[^1253]” = there is absence of a sense of acquisition or loss in sense-control, according to some. In a state of indifference there is no concealing of the

[^1253]: " The words “indriyajaya iti kecit” are not found here."



bare existence of attachment and hatred—this is the difference. He now explains his desired (definition of sense control) as “aikāgryāt... manyate[^1254]” = acting in comformity with one-pointedness of the mind the (non-attachment) of the sense-organs with reference to sense-objects like sound, etc., (is sense control according to Jaigīṣavya) “paramā...” and so on[^1255], i.e., amongst all the (above) mentioned (types of) sense control this is the supreme; “upāyāntaram...” the above-mentioned (types of) sense control (need other means) for their success; whereas in this (supreme sense control) (the yogis do not need other means of control ...).

[^1254]: "The sentence in the bhāṣya ends with “jaigīṣavyaḥ” whereas in the Vivaraṇa it ends with “manyate”."

[^1255]: "The Vivaraṇakāra has “vaśyatendriyāṇām” instead of just “vaśyatā” in the bhāṣya. Instead of “yaccittanirodhe niruddhānīndriyāṇi” the Vivaraṇakāra has “yaccittaniruddhānīndriyāṇi”. After “indriyajayavat” the Vivaraṇakāra has “upāyāntaramapekṣante” which is not there in the bhāṣya. There is “punarna” before “prayatna . . . ” in the Vivaraṇa which is not there in the bhāṣya."

 Thus the second Sādhanapāda, in the Vivaraṇa of the bhāṣya of Patañjali's *Yogasūtra(śāstra)* composed by Śrī Śaṅkarabhagavān, the Paramahaṃsaparivrājaka (wanderer) preceptor, the disciple of the venerable Śrī Govindapāda.
