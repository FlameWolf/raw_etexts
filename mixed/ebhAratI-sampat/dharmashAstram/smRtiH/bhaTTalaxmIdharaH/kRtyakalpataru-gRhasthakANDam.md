PREFACE

IN the scheme of the digest of Lakṣmidhara three sections occupy key positions. They cover in sequence thefour **āśramas** or stages of life. In the **Brahmacārikaṇḍa**, which is the first section of the **nibandha**, the preparation for family life **(gārhasthya)** is fully worked out. The**samskāras** ending with **samāvartana** are covered by it. In the **Mokṣakāṇḍa**, which is the last book of the digest, the approach to emancipation (**mukti, mokṣa**) is dealt with in the treatment of the duties of the two last **āśramas**,**vanaprastha** and **sanyāsa**. Entry into the two last stages is not obligatory even for the 'twice-born' **(dvijas)**. They are closed to women as well as **Śūdras.** But **mukti** is open to every one, irrespective of **āśrama,** **varṇa** and sex. He who strictly follows the duties and mode of life indicated for the householder can obtain **mokṣa** without entering the last stage **(sanyāsaśrama)**. In the the first, third and fourth stages of life one is not of the world, but is outside it. As marriage is the preparation for the stage of household life (**gārhasthya)**, both sexes are envisaged in the fulfilment of the duties of the second **āśrama.** It is also the only **āśrama** open to every **varṇa**. It covers the greatest and the most important part of an individual's life. Without it the stability and continued existence of human society will be impossible. While, in the Hindu theory of society, social equipoise is held to result from the maintenance of the duties of the castes and orders of life **(varṇaśrama-dharma)**, it is no less a fundamental article of the Hindu social creed that all duties are, in the last resort, founded on those of the householder**(gṛhastha)**. His religious and ritualistic duties are aimed at maintaining contact with the 'past' and and the 'future,' with divine or superhuman beings and with



subhuman beings, with all members of society and with all beings. **The Agnihotra**, the **Śrāddha**, the twenty-one**yajñas,** the **Vaiśvadeva** (in which the householder is enjoined to give food even to dogs and **caṇḍālas**), which reflects the duty of universal benevolence and compassion, the installation and worship of deities and the Supreme Being (**pratiṣṭhā** and **pūjā)**, the utilization of charity and gifts **(dāna)**, of pilgrimage **(tirtha-yātrā)**, and of vows.**(vrata)** by those who are either precluded from performing rites and sacrifices by sex or social or economic condition as means of grace, and of pacificatory**(śānti)** and penitential rites which secure the required standard of purity (**śuddhi, prāyaścitta)** are all rooted in**gārhasthya**. The student, the recluse and the anchorite are outside the ambit of civil rights and political obligations. The householder is the only effective member of the state, and the only person who will normally need the protection of courts of law to enforce his legal rights. He alone will ordinarily come within the scope of **vyavahāra** and **rājanīti.** Thus, the section on **gārhasthya** forms the logical prelude to all other sections dealing with the ordinary and occasional or special duties of the common citizen. It is the keystone in the arch of Dharma.

 Among **nibandhakāras**, **Lakṣmīdhara** alone (with the exception of **Caṇḍeśvara**, who merely copies him) has recognized the basal position of the **dharma** of the householder in the Hindu scheme of existence, **i.e**., of life and of the hereafter. Others have followed a haphazard sequence. In Indian view the true significance and meaning of wealth and well-being as well as of the ultimate reality may come from intuition or through the discipline of a regulated life in the world. Those who hold the former view consider that the gifted student**(brahmacārin)** may proceed straight to the life of the anchorite because of his possessing this intuitive knowledge. But most authorities have held that it is only one



who proceeds from stage to stage **(āsramād āśramam)** that can obtain the true understanding, in virtue of the discipline and knowledge springing from each stage of experience. As a statesman, Lakṣmīdhara is unable to see with equanimity the race-suicide involved in the spread of universal asceticism or coenobitism. He therefore rejects the opinion in favor of direct entry into **sanyāsa** after studentship, and insists on the need of a full experience of the discipline of family life for a grasp of reality and the attainment of salvation.



Family life, in the Hindu scheme, is not meant to be one of unalloyed pleasure and sense gratification. Life is a dedication. Every stage of it marks important aspects of the dedication. It is only in the family that man can attain his full development. The mere practice of austerity, without the discharge of social and spiritual obligations, cannot lead to **mukti.** A cloistered virtue, born in the shelter of hide-bound asceticism, is no virtue. It has not been tried and tempered in the fire of experience. Weighed in the balance, family life (**gārhasthya**) outweighs all other modes. As in Manu's diatribes against **sūdrasanyāsa** (the asceticism of the largest section of the community and of its chief economic prop) one may see animus against the Buddhist rule throwing open **sanyāsa**to all, women as well as men, **vipra** as well as non-**vipra,**So in Lakṣmīdhara's marashalling of the authorities exalting the **Grhasthāśrama** we can perceive the statesman enforcing the means of stabilizing society.

 **Gārhasthya** makes marriage a sacramental obligation to women and a social duty to men. One who is wifeless—a widower or a bachelor or an anchorite—cannot perform important rites. A plurality of wives is not required when one wife satisfies the needs of ritualistic duty. Monogamy follows as a rule of ordinary life. As marriage is for the woman a **samskāra**, the approach to matrimony needs regulation, detailed and minute.



Virginity in the bride is the complement of pre-marital chastity in the husband. The choice of partners for life has to be made after careful weighing of eugenic and other considerations. As the social purpose of marriage is progeny, whatever will defeat the end must invalidate a union. Tests of potency are therefore indicated for application. Rules of endogamy and exogamy, the significance of some of which is not now apparent (such as the**absolute** exclusion of the union of **sagotras**) are detailed. Lakṣmīdhara is against **sapiṇda** unions and would reject cross-cousin marriages, for which ancient custom is pleaded as an authority in some areas. Inter-caste unions are negatived. The detailed treatment, under **gārhasthya**, of the circumstances invalidating marriages, which are usually dealt with in the section on civil law (**vyavahāra**), shows the importance that Lakṣmīdhara attaches to a proper union for both ritualistic and civil duty. The rites of marriage are described with the punctiliousness of a priest and the precision of a judge. The rule of pre-puberty marriage is relaxed to the extent of declaring[(as does Shakespeare)](# "'Let still a woman take An elder than herself' (Twelfth Night, II, iv, 29-30).")' that the wife must be younger than the husband. The critical recital of the features of the traditional forms of marriage is obviously aimed at condemning its degradation by purely animal motives and instincts as well as by mercenary considerations. Even contract degrades marriage, as fraud, force or sale does, though it will not annul it. Consideration for women is a feature of Dharma. It is reflected in the rules protecting the bride in cases in which her interests are likely to be sacrificed, in the imposition of an interval between a wedding and its consummation, in the toleration of a second wife only in rare and specified cases, and by the principle of **parivedana**, which penalizes those who bring about the marriage of a younger sister (or brother) before that of the elder. The wife is the **essential** **partner**



in the domestic and occasional rites. She can officiate for her absent husband but the husband cannot function at all in any religious rite without his wife.

 The intimate connection between powers seen and unseen, and their co-operation for mutual well-being, is an article of Hindu faith. The performance of the many daily rites of the householder procures benefits not only to him but to the community as a whole. The division of benefits throws on the partners a reciprocal responsibility. He whose means are insufficient for the due performance of enjoined ritualistic duties, can look for the necessary help to the opulent (but virtuous) members of the community and to its head. Lack of means cannot be, in such conditions, an excuse for dereliction of duty. The responsibility is cast on the housholder of the first **varṇa**, though members of the other two **varṇas**, have also a similar obligation. A life of leisure or of ease is not for the conscientious **gṛhastha** even if he be a **cakravartin** :

किं त्वनुष्ठाननित्यत्वं स्वातन्त्र्यमपकर्षति।  
संकटाह्याहिताग्नीनां [प्रत्यवायैर्गृहस्थता](# "Uttararamacarita, Act I, Ś I 8.")॥

 In modern life occupation determines one's duties. It is the other way round in Hindu Dharma: duty determines occupation. In any scheme of social planning a loss of the freedom to act as one likes is implicit.**Varṇāśramadharma** is social planning resting on eternal sanctions. The duties of the Brāhmaṇa determine the occupations open to him in **normal** times. The six chapters in which the duties and occupations of the**vipra** are dealt with bring out the incorrectness of the now common view of the privileged and comfortable nature of his position at the head of society. As teacher, priest in sacrifices and donee his position is obligatory and honorary. Promiscuous mendicancy and the solicitation or even the free acceptance of gifts are prohibited.



His daily rites, the benefits of which the community gets, should not bring him any remuneration. He is enjoined to live a life of graded poverty or abstemiousness. Economic occupations, which yield income or profit, are closed to him. He cannot be king. Help in excess of what is absolutely necessary cannot be accepted by him. For the other**varṇas**, to which the duties of protection and wealth-making are assigned, the occupations open are less rigid and ascetic.

 Besides specific duties, every human being, as an individual and as a member of society, has general duties of a moral kind. They may consist in avoidances**(niyama)** or active exercise **(yama)**. The enumeration and discussion of these in several chapters lay bare the code of ethics, by which every Hindu is bound. No issue is side-tracked. The elements of a moral life are subjected to rigorous analysis, and are stated with clearness and fulness. Casuistry, involved in assumptions of conflict of duties or of permissible deviations from the path of rectitude, are rejected with caustic rigor. Lakṣmīdhara's exposition of the moral obligations of the common man **(gṛhastha)** displays the high level of Hindu ethics. In following so stern a moral code, the first **varṇa**is to set the example. Its austerity, poverty and moral rectitude accordingly earn for it a magnification of its status, as a compensation for the loss of material benefits and a life of comfort and self-regarding ease. Contrarywise, he who goes against the social code, loses his right to his **varṇa**, or any **varṇa**; he becomes an outlaw **(patita)**. Social pressure is exerted on the **patita** (outcaste), not vindictively, but in order to reclaim him by repentance, expiation and rehabilitation. For the upkeep of ethical or social standards, even the nearest relations who defy or violate the moral Code, must be abandoned. The interests of the community, especially its spiritual and moral interests, are paramount. They take precedence over the inclinations or wishes of the individual.



 Thus conceived and lived, family life **(gārhasthya)**becomes a dedication to the highest ends of existence. Its end is not vulgar pleasure but happiness of a real and lasting character. Dharma has no use for hedonism. The attainment of a knowledge of reality is the highest end of human effort. If one lives a life—not of the passive, contemplative quietist or recluse—but of an active worker, in and for society, discharging with devoutness **(śraddhā)**enjoined acts of piety and the debt to the ancestors from whom he derives his material being, meeting his obligations to the race by helping to continue it by entering the wedded estate, acknowledging by prayer and worship his devotion to the Highest, and by the cultivation of knowledge and its dissemination paying off vicariously the debt to the seers, from whom the culture of the race has sprung, he would fulfil the duties of the true householder **(gṛhastha)**. The conservation of his race, its culture, moral levels and spirituality forms the prime duty of the **gṛhastha.** It is such a recognition of the high destiny of family life, in the Hindu scheme of Dharma, that gives distinction to Lakṣmīdhara's **Gṛhasthakāṇḍa**, and vindicates his wisdom in making it a separate and major section of his great digest, as well as the basic. The act reflects the burning conviction of the Royal **Guru** and the wisdom of the foremost statesman of his kingdom and age.



It remains to recount with gratitude my obligations. In the preparation of an edition of a work, virtually long lost, the first duty of an editor is the collection of all surviving manuscripts, so as to secure an authentic text. The difficulty of surmounting so fundamental an obstacle can be realized only by those who have had to surmount it. That I have been able to do so is due to the generous help I have received. My obligations in this respect are heaviest to Sir V. T. Krishnamacharya,**K.C.I.E.**, who used his great influence to procure for me copies of the manuscripts in Udaipur and Bikanir,



and to Rājyaratna, Jñānajyoti, Dr. B. Bhattacharyya, M.A., Ph.D. the General Editor of the Gaekwad's Oriental Series. He obtained for me the manuscript in the library of the India Office, and helped me at every stage of the work by meeting my demands with promptness and cordiality. I have already recorded my indebtedness to the Hon'ble Sir M. B. Niyogi, LL.D., Judge of the High Court of Nagpur and to Mr. E. S. Maclenaghen, I.C.S. for enabling me to borrow the manuscript of the **Kṛtyakalpataru** in the library of the Bhonsle Mahārājas at Nagpur. At every stage, in the preparation and printing of this **kāṇḍa** also, I have received more help than I can forget from my former pupil, Mr. A. N. Krishna Aiyangar, M.A., LT., of the Adyar Library. He had virtually to remake the index of **pratīkas**, which is an important feature of this edition. He also helped me in preparing the notes, elucidatory and comparative, which appear almost on every page. In the interpretation of some passages and rules regarding the**yajñas**, I have benefited by the learning of Dr. T. R. Chintamani, M.A., Ph.D. of the University of Madras. The preparation of a correct “copy” was the task of my former Paṇḍit, S. Sankararama Sastri, now of the Travancore University. Mahāmahopādhyāya A. Chinnaswami Sastri saw the proofs of the portion printed at Benares.



The work was entrusted to the Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series office at Benares, and about one-half of the text was printed at its Vidyāvilāsini Press. As it ran out of its stock of the special paper used, the completion of the printing was entrusted to the Vasanta Press at Adyar. I am specially indebted to Mr. C. Subbarayudu, Manager of the Vasanta Press, for undertaking the task, for the personal attention that he gave to my demands and for the excellence of the printing.

NOTE ON THE MANUSCRIPTS USED

ONLY four manuscripts of **Gṛhasthakāṇḍa** were discovered. Of these the oldest is that in the Palace at Udaipur, which is described by P. Peterson in his**Report on the Search for Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Bombay Circle**, 1882-83 (J.B.B.R.A.S., Vol. XVI, 1883, p. 109.) It is an undated paper manuscript of 110 folia. It is the oldest of the manuscripts of this kāṇḍa in existence. It is referred to as the Udaipur MS. The next in point of age is a paper manuscript from the Bhonsle Raja's Library at Nagpur. It bears the date Samvat 1740 (i.e., A.D. 1683). It is a section of the manuscript of the**Kṛtyakalpataru** originally noted by F. Kielhorn (**Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Central Provinces**, 1874, p. 172) and included subsequently in Hirālāl's**Catalogue of Sanskrit and Prakrit Manuscripts in the Central Provinces and Berar**, 1926, No. 988. It consists of 154 folia of paper, legibly written in Nāgarī. These two manuscripts were utilized for the preparation of the "copy." After the text had been printed, I was able to secure India Office Manuscript (Bühler, 5462, Eggeling). It is a late copy and bears the date 1865 A.D. Finally, I obtained a transcript of the **Gṛhasthakāṇḍa** section (119 folia) of the manuscript of **Kṛtya-kalpataru** in the Anup Library in Bikanir Fort, which is described briefly in Rajendralala Mitra's **Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Library of the Maharaja of Bikanir, 1880, p. 406**. The readings of the two last manuscripts are given in Appendix A (pp. 436-460). The Bikanir manuscript is full of errors due to a succession of ignorant scribes. It has also many lacunae. Its readings generally agree with those of the printed edition of Caṇḍeśvara's **Gṛhastha-ratnakara** (Bibliotheca Indica, 1928). Caṇḍeśvara has, as usual, absorbed almost the whole of Lakṣmīdhara's book. His work has accordingly been useful in supplying textual variants (which are duly noted in the footnotes) and in helping to reconstruct an occasional corrupt passage.

**INTRODUCTION**

THE HINDU SCHEME OF LIFE

THE distinguishing mark of Indian society has been its organization in castes and orders **(varṇāśrama)**. The scheme is held to be divinely ordained. It is universal, immutable and eternal, and its regulations are accordingly spoken of as **sanātana-dharma**. A postulate of Indian thought is the belief in karma and transmigration. Man is born in bondage to his karma, and he can be emancipated only by his own efforts. Extinction of the tendency to rebirth is emanicipation **(mokṣa)**. It is the highest end, and all other ends are subsidiary. Life hould be so regulated as to lead to it. An ordered life, lived in accordance with **varṇāśrama-dharma**, is the appointed means to the end. Social equipoise results from its maintenance. The individual as well as society are accordingly bound to strive for its upkeep. Impurity (**mala**) clings to birth. The removal of it is both a purification and a preparation for the advance to the goal. The means of effecting this are known as the [**samśkāras**](# "तत्रात्मशरीरान्यतरनिष्ठो विहितक्रियाजन्योऽतिशयविशेषः संस्कारः। स च द्विविधः। एकस्तावत् कर्मान्तराधिकारोनुकूलः, यथोपनयनजन्यो वेदाध्ययनाधिकारपादकः। अपरस्तु उत्पन्नदुरितमात्रनाशकः यथा बीजगर्भसमुद्भवैनोनिबर्हणो जातकर्मादिजन्यः॥ (बी. मि., संस्कारका, पृ. १३२)"). Without them an onward or upward progress is impossible. Their necessity makes them [obligatory](# "वैदिकैः कर्मभिः पुण्यैः निषेकादिर्द्विजन्मनाम्। कार्यः शरीरसंस्कारो पावनः प्रेत्य चेह च॥ ( मनुस्मृति, २, २६ )"). One who has not undergone the 'cleansing' is **a-samskṛta**. The **samskāras** vary in number with caste (**varṇa**),**āśrama** (stage of life) and [sex](# "Jäiükarnya enumerates sixteen samskāras, Aṅgiras twenty-five and Gautama (VIII, 13-19) forty. In the Brahmacarikaṇḍa, the samskaras for the different castes etc., are dealt with,"). The full number has to be attended to only by the Brāhmaṇa, who has moved from**āśrama** to **āśrama** in his attempt to secure **mokṣa**. Till they



THE GṚHASTHAKĀṆḌA

are undergone, the duties which devolve on a person, for daily or periodical discharge, cannot be undertaken. For the first three **varṇas**, the initiation into Sāvitrī, known as the **upanayana**rite, is vital. With it a person is re-born. Then begins his period of study and spiritual discipline. Every stage of life has its appointed discipline, without which progress is impossible. In the initial stage of **Brahmacarya**, the main occupation is Vedic study (svādhyāya). The completion of studies qualifies a person to enter upon the next stage i.e. that of the householder (**gṛhastha**). The **samskāras**, which appertain to this stage, enable a householder to get rid of all contamination **(malakṣaya)**, congenital or acquired. By diligent attention to the duties enjoined for the householder **(satkarma)**, he not only completes his purification (**niśśeṣam** **malakṣayāya**) but acquires a proper comprehension of the true significance of wealth and well-being (**artha-tatvagati**), which itself is a step towards release from rebirth (**mokṣa**). The understanding of the meaning of **artha**may be derived from intuition, or it may be gained from its pursuit as a householder. One who does not become a gṛhastha at all, i.e. one who either dedicates his remaining life (after the period of studentship) to lifelong celibacy (**naiṣṭika-brahmacarya**), or becomes an anchorite **(sanyāsin)** immediately after studentship, may, according to some, gain this necessary understanding intuitively. Lakṣmīdhara does not share the [view](# "cf. Mokṣakāṇḍa, pp. 13-14 and pp. 33-34,"). This is seen from the **maṅgaḷa-sloka** with which the section on **gārhastya** begins There, in setting forth his own claim to expound **gṛhastha-dharma**, he explains how in his own case the knowledge had been acquired in the manner described, and how he had displayed his conviction of the necessity of the second **āśrama** by making gifts of villages to Brāhmaṇas, who were householders, and whose wives reflected in their songs the joys of wedded life (**dattānaeka-pura-dvijottama-vadhū-saṅgīta-[nadotsava](# "Ante, p. 1.")**).

THE ĀŚRAMAS

 Assigning the second section of **Kṛtyakalpataru** to the elucidation of the **dharma** of the second stage of life is tangible



INTRODUCTION

proof of Lakṣmīdhara's conviction. With the exception ofCaṇḍesvara, whose Grhastha-ratnākara is practically a re-hash of Lakṣmīdhara's [work](# " For Capdesvara's liberal appropriation of Lakşmidhara s work see the foot-notes Infra He does not specify his indebtedness in the mañgaļa-slokas prefixed to his Gṛhastharatnakara (Bibliotheca Indica, 1928)"),no other writer has followed this arrangement. The order of treatment in Kṛtya-kalpataru roughly follows that in Manusmrti. But, it is more than deference to the first authority on Dharma which makes Lakṣmīdhara deliberately adopt the scheme. Other digests begin with samskāra, go upto the end of those prescribed for the first āsrama, and then proceed to deal with them serially as parts of enjoined action (krtya) for daily discharge ([āḥnika](# "eg. Krtyaratnakara, Samskara-prakasa of the Viramitrodaya and Samskara-mayukha.")).**In Brahmacārikāṇḍa of Kṛtyakalpataru**, all rites ending with samāvartana are treated, but in **Grhasthakāṇḍa** the stress is equally on the ethics and on the ritual of family life. If twelve years be taken as the period required for the mastery of one Veda, a period of forty-eight years will be needed for the study of all the four Vedas. Baudhāyana, who alludes to the ideal, does not approve of [it](# "धर्मसूत्रे ( १, २, १६) यथा । अष्टचत्वारिंशद्वर्षाणि पौराणं वेदब्रह्मचर्यम्। चतुर्विंशति द्वादश वा प्रतिवेदम्। संवत्सरावमं वा प्रतिकाण्डम्। ग्रहणान्तं वा। जीवितस्यऽस्थिरत्वात् । कृष्णकेशोऽमीनादधीतति श्रुतिः ॥ अनया भुत्या विरोधात् स्मार्ताणां पूर्वेषां पक्षाणां त्यागः ").' Jaimini and S'abara condemn such prolonged [celibacy](# "अष्टचत्वारिंशद्वर्षाणि वेदबह्मचर्यचरणं जातपुत्रः कृष्णकेशोऽग्निनादधीत' इत्यनेन विरुदम् ॥ शबरभाष्य, १, ३, ३."),' and Kumārila explains it as meant only for the exceptional few, who would either become lifelong celibates (naiṣtḥikāḥ), or enter upon the life of a sanyäsin immediately on the completion of [**brahmacarya**](# "गृहस्थत्वं न शक्ष्यन्ति कर्तुं तेषामयं विधिः॥ नैष्ठिकब्रह्मचर्यं वा परिव्राजकतापि वा॥ (तन्त्रवार्तिक १. १९३)").' In some works prolonged celibacy is forbidden in Kaliyuga, along with the third **āsrama,** vis., that of the hermit ([**vānaprastha**](# "परागरमाधवीयोद्धृत ब्रह्मपुराणवचनं यथा- दीर्घकालं ब्रह्मचर्यं धारणं व कमण्डलोः। गोत्रान्मातुः सपिण्डात्तु विवाहो गोबधस्तथा॥ नराऽश्वमेधो मद्यं च कलौ वर्ज्यं द्विजातिभिः॥ (1, 33)")). Manu accepts all the four as enjoined sequentially, one after another. He divides life into four roughly equal



divisions, assigns the first to studentship, the next to family life, the third (which is to be accepted only when the hair turns grey and wrinkles appear on the body) to forest-life and the last to cutting away altogether from society, by becoming an anchorite. In Baudhāyana's view the last stage should commence after one has turned seventy years of age. That a person should proceed from āsrama to **āsrama** in sequence and should not skip any is the view of Manu and of most [authorities](# "आश्रमादाश्रमं गत्वा दुतहोमो जितेन्द्रियः । भिक्षाबलिपरिश्रान्तः प्रव्रजन्प्रेत्य वर्धते॥ (६, ३४)॥ अनधीत्य द्विजो वेदाननुत्पाद्य तथा सुतान्। अनिष्ट्वा चैवयज्ञैश्चमोक्षमिच्छन्व्रजत्यधः ॥ (६, ३७)॥ ब्रह्मचारी गृहस्थश्चवानप्रस्थो यतिस्तथा ॥ सर्वेऽपि क्रमशस्त्वेते यथाशास्त्रं निषेविताः।यथोक्तकारिणं विप्रं नयन्ति परम गतिम्॥ (६, ८७८८)"). The co-ordination of the four stages (samuccaya) is what they recommend. Others hold that after studentship, which is an indispensable stage of preparation, a man may pass straight on to the last āsrama (sanyāsa), if he has become desireless. The**Jābālas**, who are cited by Saṅkara in his commentary on the**Vedāntasātra** (III, iv, 18) as stating-"Let him wander forth (**parivrajet**) atonce from the state of [studentship](# "'ब्रह्मचर्यं परिसमाप्य गृही भवेत् गृही भूत्वा वनी भवेद्वनी भूत्वा प्रव्रजेत्। यदि बेतरथा ब्रह्मचर्यादेवप्रव्रजेद् गृहाद्वा वनाद्वा। यदहरेव विरजेत् तदहरेव प्रव्रजेत् ॥ (जावालोपनिषद्, ४).")"-gave no option but to proceed to the last stage directly from the first. That the skipping of the householder's life, before becoming a **sanyāsin**, is an ancient view is shown by Baudhāyana's allusion to the opinion, which he rejected on the ground that the second stage cannot be [dropped](# " 'बौधायनधर्मसूत्रे (२, १०, २. १५-१६) यथा-सोऽत एव महाचर्यवान् प्रव्रजतीत्येकेयाम् आश्रमादाश्रममुपनीय ब्रह्मपूतो भवतीति विज्ञायते । अथाप्युदाहरम्यि -आश्र- मादाश्रमं गत्वा हुतहोमो जितेन्द्रियः। भिक्षाबलिपरिश्रान्तः पधद्भवति भिक्षुकः॥इति."). This view is probably a paraphrase of the**Jābālopaniṣad** dictum, which is quoted by both Vijñāneśvara and Aparărka in their comments on Yājňavalkya (111, 56), where, however, the adoption of sanyāsa is to follow immediately after one of the three previous stages, provided he who does so has become desireless (**yadahareva virajet tadahareva pravrajet**).

 Lakṣmidhara does not recognize the permissibility of sanyäsa immediately after brahmacāryāsrama. The view of the **Jābālas**,



which **Saṅkara** cites in his commentary on the **Brahmasūtra**(III, iv, 18), should have been known to him, and possibly also the passage from **Jābālopaniṣad** cited by Aparärka. His omission of the citation in his treatment of the third and fourth **āsramas**in his **Mokṣakāṇḍa** must be construed as deliberate (pp. 12-16 and pp. 30-32). On the other hand, he begins the chapter on the third stage with a passage from the **Mahābhārata,** which only enjoins progress from stage to stage in sequence (**ārramā-dāśramam** gaccet, op. cit. p. 12). He quotes (with manifest approval) **Manusmṛti**, **VI**, 36-37, (op. cit., p. 30) condemning the contemplation of a change to the last **āsrama** before one has completed the study of the Vedas, raised sons in modes sanctioned by Dharma, and performed sacrifices according to capacity. He omits to cite the ambiguous verse of [Manu](# "प्रजापत्यां निरुप्येष्टिं सर्ववेदसदक्षिणाम्। आत्मन्यग्निन्समारोप्य ब्राह्मणः प्रव्रजेद्गृहात् ६, ३૮)")which states that a Brāhmaṇa who has performed the iṣṭi sacred to Prajāpati may depart from the house (or become a sunyasin) after depositing the sacred fire in himself. Kullūka takes the expression depart from the house' (**pravrajet grhät**) as not conflicting with the injunction to elect **sanyāsa** only after the third [**āsrama**](# " आत्मन्यग्निन्समारोप्य गृहात्' इत्यभिधानात् वानप्रस्थाश्रममनुष्ठायैव चतुर्याश्रममनुतिष्ठत् ॥ (कुल्लूकः)"),though he quotes the concluding portion of the passage from **Jābālopaniṣad**, which permits one to enter on **sanyāsa** immediately after any of the preceding **āsramas**. Lakṣmidhara quotes (p. 31) the two verses of **Yājñavalkya** (III, 56-57), without comment, as a substitute to the above verse of Manu (VI, 38), whose sense they convey. As he is familiar with**Baudhāyana**, who alludes to the view that one may enter uponsanyasa immediately after the completion of studentship i.e. without going through life in the family, it must be inferred that he himself held the view that it was best to enter on the anchorite's life only after going through the three preceding stages, and that in any case dropping the life of the householder, with its sruti-enjoined duties, was positively wrong. In his **Brahmacārikāṇḍa**, he quotes **Manusmṛti** (VI, 88) which gives the assurance of reaching the highest state (**paramām**



**gatim**) to the Brāhmaṇa who enters the four **āsramas**in the prescribed order (**kramasaḥ**).

MAGNIFICATION OF THE HOUSEHOLDER'S LIFE

 The discipline and education of the period of studentship are deemed the proper preparation for family life. While celibacy and Vedic study, which are the features of **Brahmacarya**, are admirable, prolonged **Brahmacarya** is rejected as unfit for the present age. One who has spent the best part of his life as a student, will either be unfit for family life, when he has passed middle age and has become grey-haired, or he may die in the interval. If he does either, he omits to maintain the **srauta** fires, which every **Brāhmaṇa** should instal and maintain, when he has sons and his hair is still dark. The lifelong **Brahmacarya** of the **naiṣṭhika**, as described by [Manu](# "२, २४३-२४९."), is allowed indeed but not held up as possible for every man, as the life is difficult and there is no expiation for one who assumes the life but fails to observe its [rigor](# "आस्दो नैष्ठिकं धर्मं यस्तु प्राच्यवते द्विजः। प्रायश्चित्तं न पश्यामि येन शुद्धपति कर्मणाम् ॥ (अत्रिस्मृति, ८, १६ )").The Vedic injunction not to allow the line of progeny to cease, after the completion of studentship, is a direction to [marry](# " आचार्याय प्रियं धनमाहस्य प्रजातन्तुं मा व्यवच्छेत्सीः ॥ (तैत्तरीयोपनिषद,1, 99,1)")." It is only by marrying and having sons, and by observing the duties of a householder that the triple debt to the gods, the seers and the manes can be completely discharged. Man, who is born in debt, will die a debtor if he does not marry and raise up male progeny. Lakṣmidhara quotes the verses of Manu (VI, 36-38) in **Mokṣakāṇḍā** (p. 30) to show that even the austere life of an anchorite will not avail one, if before entering on it he has not studied the Vedas according to rule, begat sons according to the sacred law, and offered sacrifices according to his ability: that is to say he should have been a **Brahmacāri** and a **Gṛhastha**and fulfilled the appointed duties of both. The superiority of the life of the householder to those of the other three is declared



by [Manu](# "सर्वेषामपि चैतेषां वेदस्मृतिविधानतः । गृहस्थ उच्यते श्रेष्ठः स त्रीनेतान् बिभर्ति हि ॥ यथा नदी नदास्सर्वे सागरे यान्ति संस्थितिम् । तथैवाश्रमिणः सर्वे गृहस्थेयान्ति संस्थितिम्॥")(VI, 87-90). The other three orders find their being and support in that of the householder, who is therefore superior to the others. "As all rivers, both great and small, find a resting place in the ocean, even so men of all orders find their abode in the householder." Lakṣmīdhara cites these verses in**Brahmacārikāṇḍa.**

 This emphasis on family life is ancient. Gautama, who is pre-Buddhist, asserts that all others are born of the gṛhastha and that the superiority of the second āsrama over the others is due to their not being able to give birth to [offspring](# " तेवा गृहस्थो योनिः अप्रजननत्वातिरेषाम् ॥ (३, ३)").It is the only āsrama (the others do not count) because it is the only one which is directly [ordained](# " ऐकाश्रम्यं त्वाचार्यः प्रत्यङक्षविधानात् गार्हस्थस्य॥(३,३६)"). Maskari explains the cryptic statement thus: though the Veda contains no injunction that there should be household-life, yet because the Vedas enjoin the performance of agnihotra and other sacrifices which only the householder is entitled to perform, therefore family life should be construed as enjoined by [sruti](# "यद्यपि गृहस्थो भवेदित्येवं न विहितं, तथाऽषि अग्निक्षेत्रादिगृहस्थसाष्यक्रियावि धानात् तस्यैव विधानं द्रष्टव्यम् (१.७५)") (p. 75). **Haradatta,**inspired perhaps by the half-sarcastic remark of [S'abara](# "अपुंस्त्यं प्रच्छादयन्तश्चाष्टाचत्वारिंशद्वर्षाणि बेदब्रह्मचर्यं चरितवन्तः। तत एषा स्मृतिरिति अवगम्यते (शवरभाष्य, १, ३, ४)") that it is only those who are impotent that go in for celibate studentship for forty-eight years, states that the orders other than those of **gṛhastha** are prescribed only for those who are unfit for family [life](# "अशक्तानामितराश्रमधर्मा विधीयन्ते (पृ. २७)")." Baudhāyana (II, 6, 29) repeats the aphorism of Gautama, and winds up the discussion of the necessity of family life by the following Vedic quotations : "May we obtain immortality through children, Oh Agni " (R. V., V, 4, 10), and “On birth **(jāyamāna)** a Brāhmaṇa is born with three debts : indebtedness to the sages through studentship, to the gods through sacrifices, and to the ancestors through offspring." (Taitt. Sam. VI, iii, 10, 5). Such Vedic injunctions as "Agnihotra



should be done as long as life lasts” are on the other hand explained by the commentators on the **Vedāntasātra** (111, iv, 20) as concerning only those who do not retire from worldly life and as not universally binding: salvation is not solely by works but also by [austerities](# "यथा श्रीभाष्ये – एबमाश्रमान्तरविधानात् ऋणश्रुतिः यावजीवश्रुतिः अपवादश्रुतिश्च अविरक्तविषया एवेति वेदितव्याः । अन्याश्चब्रह्मविदः कर्मणामाप्रयाणादवइय कर्तव्यता विधायिन्यः श्रुतयः स्मृतयश्च स्वस्वाश्रमधर्मविषयाः। अत ऊर्द्वरेतस्तु चब्रह्मविद्याविधानाद्विद्यातः पुरुषार्थ इति सिद्धम् ॥ (आनन्दमुद्रालयपुस्तके, २, ३६४).").

 From the standpoint of social utility, **gṛhasthāsrama** is manifestly the best. Society will die out if people do not marry. Statesmen all through history have seen a danger to the state in the spread of cenobitism. Buddhism (and Jainism even more), laid stress on the monastic ideal in life. It contrasted (to the advantage of the latter) the happiness of the householder with the happiness of the Buddha and the **Bhikku**(monk). A householder is never the equal of a [monk](# "Suttanipata (S. B. E., X, 33-36)."). There is no end to labour and toil in the life of the [householder](# "Vinaya Textz (S. B. E., XX, p. 225 ff.)"). Jainism is even more severe in its condemnation of family life. The **āśrama**of the householder is described as '[dreadful](# "Jaina Stras (S. B. E., XLV, p. 39)."). It makes strictures on the life of the **gṛhastha**, as compared with the monk's. The spirit of ascetic hostility to family life, on the ground of its lowering tendency on the spirit, is older than either Buddhism or Jainism. As Max Müller used to remark, there were Bauddhas before the Buddha. The revolt against the **āsrama** ideal was in the air even in the days of the **Upaniṣads**. The Bhikku was the Buddhist **sanyāsin**. He might have been of any varṇa beforebecoming a monk, whereas only a Brāhmaṇa can become a sanyäsin. He had not to pass through the earlier stages of studentship and family life before becoming a monk. The protest against S'üdra teachers, S'üdras who know the sacred books etc., in the **Maitrāyaṇa Brāḥmaṇopaniṣad** (VII, 8) is clearly aimed against practices which came to be ordinary features of [Buddhism](# " यथा मैत्र्युपनिषदि (७, ६ ed. Cowell, 1870). वे चान्ये ह पुरयायका अयाज्य- वे चान्बे ह शूद्राक्षिप्याः शूद्राश्च शास्त्रविद्वांसो... ये चान्ये ह वृयातर्कदृष्टान्तवृहोकेन्द्रजालैः  वैषिकेषु परिस्थातुमिच्छन्ति तैः स न संवसेत्॥"). Buddhism even allowed female ascetics



([nuns](# "A. S. Altekar, Position of Women in Hindu Civilisation, 1938, p. 248.")). The withdrawal into an ascetic life means that the person who does so is not available for economic pursuits and becomes a burden on the community, which has to support him. This is why Kauṭilya imposes punishment on those who initiate women in asceticism (parivrajya), and who become ascetics without first providing for dependents and [family](# "पुत्रदारमप्रतिबिधाय प्रवजतः पूर्वस्साहसदण्डः । स्त्रियं च प्रवाजयतः ॥ (कौटिलीय,पृ. ४८)"). One who has become old (lupta-vyavāyah) could, in Mauryan times, be restrained from becoming a sanyasin if he has not distributed, as above, his [property](# " लुप्तभ्यषायः प्रमजेत् आवृश्च्य धर्मस्वान् । अन्यथा नियम्येत ॥ (कौटि. १. ४८)").One who has become a **sanyāsin** without first becoming a **vānaprastha** cannot enter villages of cultivators under Kauṭilya's regulations, and he should not get residence [there](# "वानप्रस्थादन्यः प्रवजतिभावः, सजातादन्यः संघः, सामुत्थाय कादन्य समयानुबन्धो या नास्य जनपदमुपविशेत । न तत्रारामविहारार्थाः शालास्स्युः न कर्मविघ्नं कुर्युः । (कौटि. पृ. ४८)"). Dharmaśāstra saw in **grhasthāsrama** a support of the universal order as well as of society. Arthaśāstra saw in it the foundation of economic and social life. The declarations in the epics that, weighed in the balance, the second **āsrama**outweighs all the others taken together, and that it is the most excellent of all [**āsramas**](# " गया महाभारते (शान्तिपर्वणि, १३, १५, २१ ) – सिद्धक्षेत्र मिषं पुष्यमय मेवाश्रमो महान् ॥ तपश्रेष्ठं प्रजानाथ मूलमेतम संशयः ॥ (१८९, १०), यथा - गार्हस्थ्यं खलु द्वितीयमाश्रमं वदन्ति । समावृत्तानां सदाचाराणां सहधर्मचर्याफलार्थिनां गृहस्थाश्रमो विधीयते । धर्मार्थकामाबाप्त्यर्थ त्रिवर्गसाधनं अपेक्ष्यागर्हितेन कर्मणा बनान्यादाय स्वाध्यायोपलम्भ प्रकर्येण वा ब्रह्मर्षिनिर्मितेन या हव्यकव्यनियमाभ्यां देवतपूजासमाधिप्रसादबिध्युपलब्धेन धनेनगृहस्थो गार्हस्थ्यं वर्तेत् । तद्धि सर्वाश्रमणां मूलमुदाहरन्ति । गुरुकुल निवासिनः परिप्राजका ये चान्ये संकल्पितमतनियमधर्मायिनः तेषामन्यत एव भिक्षाबलिसंविभागाः प्रवर्तन्ते ॥")are in tune with this spirit. Religious and political considerations united in the exaltation of family life.

GṚHASTHAKĀṆḌA

 Such is the background of Lakṣmidhara's Gṛhasthakāṇḍa, It forms the second book of his comprehensive digest. It must have been one of the earliest sections of Kṛtya-Kalpataru to be



composed and made [public](# " A part of it (वैवाहिकपर्व) is referred to in Vyavaharakaṇḍa, while on p. 314 a reference to certain topics as to be treated hereafter in Prayarcıtta-käṇḍa is found."). From the standpoint of the ordinary citizen its utility as a guide to day to day life must have seemed much greater than that of other sections of the **nibandha.**In a sense every section of the digest concerns the householder. The first only describes the preparation for it. The ascetic is freed from the obligation to maintain the sacred fires and to follow ordained rites, and the hermit has voluntarily withdrawn himself from society. The sections on **srāddha, āhnika, dāna,tirtha-yātrā**, pratiṣṭhā and pūjā, vrata, suddhi and sänti concern only the gṛhastha. So is the section on **vyavahāra** because students, hermits and anchorites have no matters necessitating adjudication. Such persons come within the jurisdiction of regal activity (**Rājadharma**) only indirectly, from the obligation of the state to provide for every order the facilities for following its regulations, and to maintain the **varṇāsrama** system. The state is directly concerned with grhasthas alone, as they must form the largest part of the population. While the **supplementary** activities of householders are dealt with in nine out of the fourteen sections of the **nibandha**, the **normal** life of the family-man, its duties and inhibitions, for every caste (**varṇa)**, requires separate consideration by itself, as an introduction to the rest. This is the aim of **Gṛhasthakāṇḍa**. The subject is treated exhaustively in twenty-seven [chapters](# "Rearranged as thirty-four in this edition."). Family life is only the means to the end. Release is impossible from the toils of **Karma** to one who remains indebted (ṛṇī). By begetting progeny, which is possible legitimately only in **g**

ā

**rhastya**, one is released from one of the three natal debts. He need not dread habitation in the hell of Put, between incarnation and incarnation, for being sonless (inf. p. 432). But complete release from indebtedness can come only through meticulous attention to the duties of the Grhastha.

RELATION OF MARRIAGE TO Gārhastya

 In popular opinion one becomes a householder in order to marry. This is an inversion of the correct view. Capacity to



perform many Vedic rites requires the co-operation of the wife, as an unmarried person is not competent to perform them. One must accordingly marry that he may perform them. Marriage completes **Gārhastya** technically, but its real completion is only after the birth of a son. Progeny saves a person and his ancestors from detention (after death and before they are born again) in the hell of Put. Hence a son is called **putra**, he who saves one from falling into Put. For the success of every form of worldly activity (loka-yātrā) a wife is indispensable. [(Manu, IX, 26-27)](# "प्रजननार्थं महाभागाः पूजार्हा गृहदीप्तयः। लियः श्रियश्चगेहेषु न विशेषोऽस्ति कश्चन॥ उत्पादनमपत्यस्य जातस्य परिपालनम्। प्रत्यहं लोकयात्रायाः प्रत्यक्षं स्त्रीनिबन्धनम्॥ (९, २६-२७)"). It is because both the capacity to perform appointed sacrifices and rites and the protection against falling into hell are conferred by the first marriage itself, if it results in the birth of a son, that **Āpastamba** forbids a man, who is so wedded to take a second [wife](# "आप. ध. सू., २, ५, ११, १२ १३ – धर्मप्रजासंपन्ने दारे नान्यां कुर्वीत। अन्यथा भावे प्रागन्याधेयात्॥").A second marriage is, from the point of view of religious obligation, purposeless and therefore is unjustifiable. But sex urge is the common incentive to marry; so is companionship or service of a devoted partner for [life](# "मनु, (१, २८) यथा - अपत्यं धर्मकार्याणि शुश्रूषा रतिरुत्तमा। दाराधीनस्तथा स्वर्गः पितृकामात्मनश्चह॥"). But neither rati nor **susrūṣā** counts in the sacramental view; both may be gained without lawful wedlock. To enter the second āsrama is obligatory, because its incidents enable a dviju to fulfil his duty (Dharma) thoroughly, as no person, other than an outcaste, can be without an **āsrama**, i.c., be **an-āsrami**. One who takes the bath (snāna), which signifies the termination of the student life (**Brahmacaryāsrama**), and returns home (samāvartet) has done with the first **āsrama**, and has automatically entered the second. The rigors of the life of the student are over, and he is free, like a married person to use sandal and unguents, **tambāla** and garlands, as well as ear-rings and jewels. The girdle of kusa grass, the staff and the black antelope hide which, as a **Brahmacārî**, he had to keep constantly, are discarded formally. The bath (snāna) signifies the end of



an old and the commencement of a new life, with new duties and new liberties. The new **snātaka** is a **gṛhastha** to all intents and purposes except that he is not married. The **smṛtis** make no difference between the two, and the regulations, which pass as those prescribed for the guidance of the **snātaka** are equally binding on the married gṛhastha. The identification of the two will be seen from such rules as these: a **snātaka** should not look on a nude woman except during sex-intercourse; let him not eat with his wife. [(Manu, IV. 53. 43)](# "नग्नां नेक्षेत च स्त्रियम्॥ नाऽश्रीयात् भार्याया सार्द्धम्॥"). A chapter on the ethics of a family man (ch. 17 infra) is headed by **Lakṣmīdhara, Snātkavratāni**. The implication is that when one takes the bath at the end of the period of studentship, the lustration signifies the end of one set of vows of conduct (**vrata**) and the assumption of a new set of vows.

THE APPROACH TO Gārhastya

 To become a **gṛhastha**, a **dvija** (twice-born) person should undergo certain rites of purification, without which he is unfit to enter on the new stage. The first of them is the ceremonial shave or removal of hair from the head and some parts of the body. It is called **kesānta** or **godāna**. According to Manu, [(II,65)](# "केशान्तः षोडशे वर्षे ब्राह्मणस्य विधीयते। राजन्यबन्धोर्द्द्वाविंशे वैश्यस्य द्व्यधिके ततः ॥ (२, ६५)")the **samskāra** should be done for a Brāhmaṇa in the sixteenth year after his conception, for a Kṣatriya in the twenty-second year and for a Vaisya in the twenty-fourth. As studentship may not be over for one of the first **varṇa** by the sixteenth year (twelve years being the time normally required for the study of one Veda) **godāna** cannot mark the end of the life of study. But **godāna** has to be finished before one can marry. It was accordingly ruled later on that the ceremony may be done any time before marriage. Lakṣmīdhara cites the above sloka of Manu and does not deal further with **godāna**. The ceremonial removal of hair is even now a preliminary to marriage, and is mixed up with the ceremony of lustration (snāna). The importance



attached to it in the past may be seen from Kālidāsa's reference to Dilīpa as making Raghu undergo it prior to his [marriage](# "अथास्य गोदानविषेरनन्तरं विवाहदीक्षांनिरवर्तयद्गुरुः।नरेन्द्रकन्या तमवाप्य सत्पतिं तमोनुदं दक्षसुता इबाबभुः ॥ ( रघुवंश, ३, ३३)").

 The second rite is **snāna** (bath). It is done by the student who does not wish to remain a life-long celibate and student, living with his **guru** or his family. The former described as **upakurvāṇaḥ** (he who makes a return to the teacher) and the latter as **naiṣṭhikaḥ** (student till death). The life of the latter is a rigorous continuation of **brahmacarya**, undertaken voluntarily. There is no expiation for one who undertakes this mode of life and then forsakes it. The **upakurvāṇa** approaches the teacher with a gift, and secures permission to mark the end of his studentship by the prescribed bath (**snāna**). The gift was, in olden days, a cow or cow's. The **snātaka**, the person who undergoes the lustration, may be of three kinds: he who has finished his studies (**vidyāsnātaka**), he who has completed the precribed vratas of **Brahmacarya** (**vrata-snātaka**), and he who has done with both **vidyā**and**vrata [(vidyā-vratasnātka)](# "These are detailed in Brahmacarı Kanda, IX, I.").**” Gautama holds that he who has become a **snātaka**, should be styled so till he marries, when he is called a **[gṛhastha](# "See Maskarin's comment on Gautama, IX, I.समाप्तब्रह्मचर्यो गुर्वनुज्ञया स्नानो यावता कालेन यत्नं कृत्वा भार्यामधिगच्छति तावन्तं कालं स्नातकव्रताधिगतोऽविप्लुतब्रह्मचर्यो गृहस्थान्तर्भूत एव।तदर्थं एवगृहस्थसदृशी इत्यत्र अकृतबिवाहेऽपि गृहस्थशब्दः प्रयुक्तः॥").**Vasiṣṭha (p. 5 inf.) states that the “**gṛhastha** " having obtained the permission of his teacher and performed the lustration (snätvá) should obtain a virgin, younger than himself, of another gotra and **pravara**, as a hit bride. Lakṣmidhara justifies the use of the term **gṛhastha** to describe one who has yet to marry as either an example of a future status being reflected backwards, or, as explained by Bhartṛyajña, to show that one who has resolved on assuming the **āsrama** of **gṛhastha**and released himself from the other **āsrama** is thereby inducted in the duty of the householder (**gṛhastha-dharmeṣvadhikriyate**).

 Neither in **Brahmacārikāṇḍa** nor in the next **kāṇda** does**Lakṣmidhara** describe the ritual of snana, which **Mitramiśra**furnishes (**Samskāraprakāsa**, pp. 575-576). The procedure prescribed by his own **Gṛhyasūtra** should be followed by every one.



 After the bath, the **snātaka** returns to his home, if he has all along been living with his teacher. The ceremony is accordingly named **samāvartanam** (home-coming). In practice, both **godāna** and **snāna** are performed on the same day,

 An interval of varying duration should have existed in ancient times between **samāvartana** and marriage. Such an interval must have been needed to make the careful investigations into the fitness of the bride and the bridegroom, which are prescribed in all **smṛtis**, as well as the negotiations for the marriage. Such expressions as **vāg-dattā** (orally promised in marriage) and **manodattā** (mentally given) would also suggest it.

THE SACRAMENT OF MARRIAGE (Vaivāhika-samskāra)

 In all enumerations of **samskāras**, **vivāha** finds a prominent place. It is described by Gautama (VIII, 15) as **sahadharmacāriṇīsamyoga**, "union with the partner in all prescribed rites," in a way which describes its aim and merit. It is, according to some authorities the only **samskāra** for the [Śūdra](# "जातूकर्ण्यः—'विबाहमात्रं संस्कारं शूद्रोऽपि लभतां सदा। (बीरमित्रोदये, संस्कारप्रकासे, पृ.१३४.)"). The occasions for all other **samskāras** spring only from it. Without a wife, no religious rites can be done ; consequently one must take a wife. The worship of gods, and libations to ancestors, **þitṛ-nām udaka-kriyā**, are possible only to one who has a wife. Marriage is the way to heaven (**darāḥ svargasya samkramaḥ, p. 7**). Under the**vikalpa-vāda**, there **seems** to be an option to one who has completed his studentship to skip over **vivāha**, but it is an option which is available only to the rare person, who is constitutionally desireless. Its postponement is deprecated for men, beyond the age limits indicated for the normal termination of **brahmacarya**. The option does not exist for women, A girl who becomes a **rajasvalā** in her father's house without previously getting married (even if born a Brāhmaṇī) is counted by Viṣṇu (p. 49) as **vṛṣaḷi** (a **śūdrā**). Manu's injunction (p. 33) that it is better for a girl to remain unwedded in the parental home, even if she becomes nubible (**ṛtumatyapi**), is explained away by Lakṣmīdhara, thus : "the meaning is that she should not be



given in marriage to one devoid of good qualities, but one who has attained puberty should not be detained (**na dhāryā**) in the house." (p. 33) The idea is made still clearer in the comment he makes on the verse of Yama—"A girl should be given, as a**nagnikā** if possible, to one who is possessed of good qualities, but never to one who is bad ; and at the same time one who has attained puberty should not be restrained (**noparundhyāt**) i.e., from making her own choice of a husband." (cf. p. 48). On the other hand, the dictum of **Baudhāyana** (IV, 1, 12) that a girl should be given away in marriage, before she gets a sense of modesty (i.e., when she is under ten) and is possessed of a dutiful disposition (**dharmacāriṇī**) to a good man, and even to one who is not altogether satisfactory, as she should not be detained till she attains puberty. (p. 52). The indefinite postponement of the marriage of a girl entails on her an invisible loss of virginity, for after she becomes nubible (and remains unmarried) she is preyed upon by Soma, the Gandharva, Vāyū and Agni. A father should give away his daughter before she is so enjoyed by the gods. (p. 54) Marriage being an obligation (**samskāra**) a father or even a girl has no option and cannot maintain her in an unmarried [state](# "'न चिरं वासयेत्कन्यां स्वामी प्राप्तफलां गृहे।' (quoted from Devala, p. 409.)"). In a similar context, the same idea is enforced by **Varadarāja** in his [**Vyavahāranirṇaya**](# "ed. Rangaswami, 1942, pp. 388-389. This nibandha is only about a century later than the Kṛtya-Kalpataru."). Manu's sloka that a girl had better remain unmarried rather than be married to an unsatisfactory person is treated there as a glorificatory exaggeration (**arthavāda**) of the idea contained in his previous sloka (IX, 88) that a father should give away his daughter, even if she has not grown up (**aprāptām** **api**), to a very suitable bridegroom. The epics contain stories of the grave spiritual risks that a woman runs by remaining single all her life. On the warning of the sage **Nārada**that if she did not marry before she died she would not go to heaven, Subhrū the daughter of Kuṇi Gārgya, who remained a virgin till old age, practising austerities, persuaded ŚringavatGālava, by the promise of receiving half her acquired merit (**puṇya**), to marry her for a day just before she [died](# "महाभारते, शल्यपर्वणि, ५३, ३-२४. 'असंस्कृतायाः कन्यायाः कुतो लोकस्तबानये' इति नारदवचनं तत्र॥"). The



idea is carried among the Nambūdiris of Malabar to the

grotesque length of marrying a dead virgin to a living person, in

order that she might not lose [heaven](# "Report of the Malabar Marriage Commission. 1894. p 13. L. K. Anantakrishna lyer. Cochin Tribes and Castes. II. 1912. p 198, states that the Nambūdiris of whom he enquired totally denied the prevalence of the custom."). Another legend in theepic states that the blind sage Dīrghtamas made the rule thatthenceforward every unmarried woman shall incur mortal [sin](# "महाभारते, आदिपर्वणि, अ. ११३, ३४-३६, यथा—अद्यप्रभृति मर्यादा मया लोके प्रतिष्ठिता। अपतीनान्तु नारीणामद्यप्रभृति पातकम्॥").

In the **Rāmāyaṇa**

, the saintly Śabarī, who practises austerities inan unmarried state, is accorded salvation specially by

[Śri Rāma](# "AraṇyāKāṇḍa. Sarga 74.").

When Buddhism instituted an order of nuns [(**theri, i.e. sthavirā**)](# " Among the nuns of the Terigatha, the majority had renounced the world before marriage Several were beiresses (Altekar, op. cit., pp. 248-249.)")

many virgins joined the order. The practice must have

outraged Brahmanical sentiment. Marriage was justified as

**upanayana** for women, service to the husband as service to the

teacher and attention to household duties as equal to the tending

of the sacred [fire](# "मनुः (2, ६७)—वैवाहिको विधिस्त्रीणां संस्कारो वैदिकः स्मृतः। पतिसेवा गुरौ वासो गृहार्थेऽग्निपरिक्रिया॥"). **Vivā**

**ha** fulfils for women the functions ofboth the **samskāras.**

GENERAL CONDITIONS OF MARRIAGE

 On "returning home" (**samāvartanāt param**), the **snātaka** should be seated on a cot (**talpa**), made to wear a garland,**(sragviṇa**) and ear-rings (**kuṇḍalau**), as enjoined in his **Gṛhyasūtra**, and be accorded the honor of a **madhuparka**, which is shown only to the great. The actions are symbolic of the cessation of the ascetic rigor of the student's life. A Brahmacārī is prohibited from sitting on a bedstead (**talpa**) wearing garlands and ear-rings and partaking of a honey-mixture [(**madhuparka**)](# "Madhuparka is offered only to six classes of persons : ऋत्विजो कृत्वा मधुपर्कमाहरेत्। स्नातकायोपस्थिताय। राज्ञे च। आचार्यश्वशुरपितृव्यमातुलानां च॥ (आश्वलायनगृह्ये, १, २४, १—४). षढर्ध्यार्हा भवन्त्याचार्य ऋत्विग्राजा विवाह्यः प्रियः स्नातक इति (काठकगृह्य, ed. Caland., २४-१)").

The householder is entitled to all these. During the



ceremony of marriage, when the bride-groom is first received in the bride's home, he should be offered the honey-mixture, and another should be offered at the close of the ceremony, when he goes back to his own [home](# "शाक्रवायनगृह्यसूत्र १, १२, १०.  See Kaṭhaka-Gṛhyasūtra (ed. Caland., 1922) p. 76.").'

 The bride and bride-groom being otherwise satisfactory and conforming to the qualities (physical and mental) specified in detail, a union is still possible only between those who are equal in caste, (**savarṇa**), family (**kula**) and conduct (**sila**) (p. 5). The relative ages of the bride-groom and the bride should conform to the enjoined proportions, i.e. ordinarily the bridegroom's age should be thrice that of the bride, if she is under ten (**nagnikā**). The bride must be a virgin (**a-spṛṣṭamaithunā**) and must not have been already "married" i.e. she should not be a **punar-bhū** (p. 28). Seven classes of girls are brought under the category of **punar-bhū**by Kāśyapa (p. 30) viz., she who has been promised in marriage, she whose mind has been set on marrying another **([manodattā](# "मनोदत्ता अन्यत्रासक्तचित्ता"))**, she who has undergone the ceremony of having the **kankaṇa** (wristlet) fastened (**kṛtakautuka-mangaḷā**), she who has been given away with water (**udakasparsitā**), she who has gone through the ceremony of clasping hands (**pāṇigrahītā**), she who has made the circuit of the sacred fire during a marriage ceremony (**agnimparigatā**) and she who has actually been previously married. Another classification (p. 31) brings within the category one whose marriage has been completed by **saptapadī** (seven steps round the fire), one whose marriage has been consummated (**bhuktā**), one who has conceived (**gṛhita-garbhā**) and one who has given birth to a child (**prasūtā**). By marrying a **punarbhū**, the husband obtains neither the capacity to fulfil the obligations of his caste nor his religious duties. The term **bhāryā**(wife) implies one who has undergone the **samskāra** of marriage. A**punarbhū**has already undergone it once, and cannot therefore undergo it again on re-marriage.



On the part of the bride-groom also pre-maritial chastity is enjoined, if he marries after having been a bachelor. Chastity



is one of the obligations of **brahmacarya** (studentship), and there are other obligations. On becoming a **snātaka**, and before he takes a wife, his inhibitions as a student drop away, with one exception, and that is that he should, like a **brahmacārī**, abstain from sexual intercourse, the right to it arising only after marriage. This is the interpretation of Medhātithi of **Manusmṛti**, III, 2, cited by Lakṣmīdhara at the very beginning of the book (p. 3). An alternative explanation considered and rejected by Medhātithi is that only he who has kept chaste during studentship is entitled to marry. But this cannot be intended, as the student who breaks the vow of chastity, (**avakīrṇī**) has severe expiatory rites prescribed in the **Gṛhyasūtras**, which, if undergone, will enable him to qualify for [marriage](# "Compare for instance the expiation prescribed by Baudhayana Dh. S., II, 1, 30-36"). No such expiation is provided for the girl who has lost her virginity.

ENDOGAMY AND HYPERGAMY

 A rule of endogamy is recommended for the three first**varṇas**. A **dvija** should marry a girl of his own **varṇa** (caste) for the first or sacramental union. (Manu, III, 12, p. 38). But this rule is explained by Lakṣmīdhara as applicable only if a wife of the same caste is available (p. 38). If she is not to be had, then, as motivated by sex desire, he may marry, in order, one of the lower **varṇa**, a partner of each lower caste being eligible only if one from a higher caste is unavailable. Paiṭhīnasi advises the Brāhmaṇa who is unable to obtain a bride of his own caste either to remain a **suātaka** or to create progeny on a **kṣatriya** wife, and so on, in the above order. Equal marriages are for the discharge of the debt to ancestors (p. 39). The rule applicable is that ascribed to Gautama by Medhātithi (III, 12), that "if one's wife is endowed with virtue and off-spring, one should not take another wife, but in the event of failure of any of the two qualifications, he may take an additional wife."



Thus for every woman, there is a husband of her own**varṇa**, whom she is recommended to marry, and in the alternative one in any of the higher **varṇas**. Gautama has given a scale of ascent of the offspring of hypergamous (**anuloma**)



unions in the seventh or, in exceptional cases, in the fifth generation, a change to the higher caste occurs, if a girl born of such a union, consorts with one of a higher caste and her daughter, grand-daughter, etc., continue the same practice. [(IV, 22-23) '](# "वर्णान्तरगमनमुत्कर्षापकर्षाभ्यां सप्तमेन।"). But even he excludes the offspring of a S'ūdra woman from this privilege [(IV, 26)](# "प्रतिलोमस्तु धर्महीनः। शूद्रायां च।").Hypergamous unions still take place in Kerala, where women, born to Brāhmaṇa fathers and Ksatriya mothers, consistently marry only Brāhmaṇas, with the result that sons born of such unions have gained rights of commensality with Brāhmaṇas, though continuing to call them. selves [Kṣatriyas](# "In the ksatriya houses of noble ancestry, none but Nambūdiri Brahmans are allowed to contract Sambandham marriage with the ladies' (L. K. Anantha-krishna Iyer, Cochin Tribes and Castes, II, 1912, p. 152.) पञ्चमेनाचार्याः । [इदमपि कृतापेक्षया द्रष्टव्यमिति मस्करी] ।").The practice must have long been discon-tinued outside Kerala. In the authorities quoted by Lakṣmidhara such caste promotion is not reflected. Vasiṣtha (I, 24) who cites the view of some (eke) that a S'üdra woman may marry a Brāhmaṇa, without Vedic mantras, condemns the union as strongly as the other authorities quoted, declaring it to lead to degradation of the husband's family (**kulāpakarṣa)**and loss of heaven (a-svargya), (p. 40). The degradation springs, according to Usanas and Härīta from the moment of marriage, from the birth of a son in the union according to S'aunaka, and from the birth of children of offspring of either sex according to Gautama (p. 44). Lakṣmīdhara explains that the strong condemnation of the taking of a S'üdra woman in marriage by a man of a higher caste cannot be construed as an **absolute** prohibition. It only fails to confer on the S'üdra wife the status required to participate in the husband's ritual acts (sahadharmacariṇī). The prohibition is to be understood as valid only if the man can have a wife from a higher caste (p. 45). The lurid picture of the degradation in the second and third generation of the descendants of the union of a S'adra female is merely intended to discourage such a mésalliance, (p. 45). If a Brāhmaṇa has a wife of each of the four castes, taken under the above conditions, the Brāhmaṇa wife



alone shares, if she is alive, in his religious acts, and if she is not the other **dvija** wives, but not the Śūdra wife. [(Medhātithi, III, 18)](# "यदि कथंचिच्छूद्राऽपि ब्युह्यते तदैतानि कर्माणि तत्प्रधानानि न कर्तव्यानि। न च तया सह त्रैवर्णिकस्त्रीवद्धर्मेऽधिकारोऽस्तीत्यर्थः। भार्यात्वादधिकारे प्राप्ते निषेधोऽयम्। न स्वधर्मे धनं विकियुजानस्य न तदीयाज्ञोपयुज्यते, यथा द्विजातिस्त्रीणाम्। अन्यत्र तु अर्थकामयोः साऽपि अनतिचरणीया एव॥ (मेधातिथिभाष्ये, पृ. २१६)").

EXOGAMY : PROHIBITED DEGREES OFf RELATIONSHIP

 Marriage within a definite circle is prohibited if both the bride and bridegroom are of it. The circle is drawn by consanguinity, real or assumed. Descendants from a common ancestor or ancestress, upto specified generations, are held to be united by the obligation to offer funeral offerings of balls of cooked rice (**piṇda**) or by their having common particles (**piṇda**) derived from the common ancestry. Such relations are termed **sapiṇḍas** of one another. The relationship may go back indefinitely, and bring an immense number of persons within **sāpiṇḍya**, even without its extension by analogy to stepmothers and their relations, adopted sons, etc., and marriage be made impossible, if it be ruled that no two **sapiṇḍas** may marry each other. Accordingly, the restriction is narrowed down, and one is prohibited from marrying only a girl who is a **sapiṇḍa** of his mother or his father upto the **seventh** generation (**ā-saptamāt**, p. 10 inf.) according to Sumantu, in the text adopted in the available manuscripts of **Gṛshasthākaṇḍa.** The usual limits are five degrees on the mother's side and seven on the —father's, and Caṇḍeśvara, citing the identical passage, has **ā-pañcamāt**. Medhātithi (pp. 205-206) restricts Manu's prohibition of marriage of a girl related to one's mother (**ā-sapiṇḍā** **ca yā mātuḥ**, p. 7) to the **fifth** step on the mother's side, following Gautama (IV, 3, 5), whose rule is cited and explained by Lakṣmīdhara (p. 8). If the bridegroom has been the offspring of **niyoga** (levirate), the bar is to count for the relations of both the putative and actual father (**bījin**). The sons, grandsons etc., of the father's maternal uncle, the sons and descendants of the paternal grandmother's sister (**pitṛbāndhavāḥ**), and the sons etc., of the maternal grandmother's



sister and brother, and of the mother's father's sister (**mātṛ-bāndhavāḥ**), are all brought by Lakṣmīdhara's explanation (p. 8) within the prohibited circle for marriage. The alternative given by Paiṭhīnasi (p. 8) of excluding only **three** degrees on the mother's and **five** on the father's side is explained away as applicable only to cases of relationship through a wife, who is not of the same **varṇa** as the husband (**a-samānajātīya**).



The exclusion by relationship applies to all **varṇas**.

 On the theory of **sapiṇḍa** relationship springing from the possession of common particles, a husband and wife are **sapiṇḍas** of each other, since their children have the particles (**piṇḍa**) of both. All the wives of a father are 'mothers' to a son. (p. 10). Accordingly, their brothers, sisters and maternal uncles stand to him in the same relation as his own natural mother's brothers, sisters, and maternal uncles. His step-sisters are sisters to him, their children his nephews and nieces. By analogy, one's teacher stands in a paternal relationship ; and his children and relations are to be treated similarly as coming within the prohibited degrees for marriage (p. 10). Sumantu andVyāsa (p. 10) would exclude maternal relations only in the case of **dvijas**, i.e. the first three castes, suggesting a relaxation of the prohibition in the case of Śūdras. Where parentage or ancestry are not **correctly** known or recognized, **janma-paṛamparā-vijñāne,** (p. 9) there is no accrual of guilt if one marries within prohibited degrees. This is the view of Vyāsa, which Lakṣmīdhara endorses. Caṇḍeśvara (p. 10) notes that in this context, Halāyudha restricted the immunity from guilt only to cases of ignorance of ancestry, reckoned from the **putrikā-putra**. As smṛtis are agreed in deprecating one's marrying an only daughter, on the ground that her husband might be compelled to enter into an arrangement with his father-in-law to make her son the grandfather's son **(putrikā-puṭra)**, thereby bringing to himself the loss of the benefit of male progeny, no person, who had any standing or family to think of, would offer to marry a **putrikā** (p. 27). The ancestry of such a bride-groom may well be obscure and known only to himself. This will explain Halāyudha's point.



In Lakṣmīdhara's view (p. 11) women within the above prohibited degrees, if taken in marriage, will cause confusion by mixture of castes (**samkara**) i.e. prove adulterous, and will



actively cause **a-dharma**, on the presumption that those who defy the injunctions of Dharmaśāstra will be equally ready to defy morality and religion.

COUSIN MARRIAGES

 It will be noticed that Lakṣmīdhara is definitely against cross cousin marriages. The practice is old, and instances which are given in epic legend, have had to be explained away by[Kumārila](# "Tantravārtikā. (Ānādāśrama ed. of Jaimini). p. 204."). Lakṣmīdhara sometimes quotes Kumārila with deference, and must have been familiar with Kumārila's sarcastic condemnation of the southern practice of marrying the daughter of one's maternal uncle. Baudhāyana illustrates an argument that those who follow customs, which are not deemed repugnant to good conduct in any country may follow them without incurring blame, by five practices of Southerners, among which two are the marriage the maternal uncle's daughter and of the paternal aunt's [daughter](# " Dharmasūtra. I, 1. 19-26 (=I. 1. 2. 1-8, Būhler's translation)."). Baudhāyana takes the view that the practices will be permissible only in the area, in which they have been prevalent. But, he notes that this opinion is opposed to Gautama's view (XI, 20) that only customs which are not opposed to **smṛti** are valid, and **smṛtis** have forbidden such marriages. Bṛhaspati is quoted in Lakṣmīdhara in his **Vyavahārakāṅḍa**, for the view that the southern custom of marrying a maternal uncle's daughter does not necessitate an expiation, as it is valid **deśācāra** for those dwelling in that area. But, in his comments, he points out that for actions which go beyond the **desācāra** thus explicitly specified, the general rule of Gautama will [apply](# "देशजातिकूलधर्माश्चआत्रायैरविरुद्धाः प्रमाणम् (गो. ध. सू. ११, २२)").The drift of his argument is that in South India alone can marrying a maternal uncle's daughter be tolerated for those whose custom it is, but nowhere else. Consequently, for the rest of the world, the prohibition of the marriage of the paternal aunt's daughter must apply, equally with that relating to the marriage of **mātula-kānyā** (maternal uncle's daughter). Lakṣmīdbara must of course have been aware of Baudhāyana's statement of both kinds of cross-cousin marriage



as customary in South India, and his omission to cite Baudhāyana in the context must be intentional. Manu has condemned the practice (XI, 173) and as Manu supersedes all other smṛti authors, the rejection by Manu (p. 10) is enough for Lakṣmīdhara. He must have known Medhātithi's explanation of the custom of marrying the daughter of a maternal uncle so as to bring it under Manu's definition of **sadācāra**, "[practice of the good](# "तस्मिन्देशे यआचारः पारम्पर्यक्रमागतः। वर्णानांसान्तरालानां स सदाचार उच्यते॥ (मनु, २, १८)")," as he frequently quotes Medhātithi : viz., that nephews falling in love with their pretty cousins married them for fear of state punishment, or that they simply followed an older practice, acting on Manu's [injunction](# "येनास्य पितरो माता येन माताः पितामहाः। तेन यायात् सतां मार्गं तेन गच्छन्नरिष्यति॥ (८, १७८)") to walk in the steps of their fore-fathers. The prohibition of the marriage of near relations, who are **sapiṇḍas**, must have sprung from the fear of complications in the over-grown joint family, the members of which lived in the same house, if freedom was given to younger members to marry as they pleased in the family circle. In South India, where the custom has been for a woman to go to the father's house for confinement, taking her children with her at the time, intimacy between cousins must have commonly sprung up, leading to the marriage of cousins, and a practice which could not be stopped hardened into a local custom.



If Lakṣmīdhara had merely stated the injunction not to marry **sapiṇḍas**, a defence of the marriage of some **mātulakanyās** might be made on the ground that, if they were not**sapiṇḍas** of their paternal aunt's sons, their marriages will not be barred. Transfer of a bride to the husband's family (and gotra) springs from her being given away to the bridegroom**(kanyā-pradānam)** and on the cessation of her tie to her parental family thereon. It is only in weddings in which the bride is given as a gift (**kanyādāna**) that **sapiṇḍa** relationship arises for the bride in her husband's family. In the **gāndharva, āsura** and other inferior forms of marriage there is no gift of the bride, and her relationship to her parental family should therefore be held uninterrupted by the marriage. If a son is born of such a union,



he will be a **sapiṇḍa** of his mother, **maternal** uncle and **maternal**uncle's **daughter** and his marriage with the last will not be barred. Such an ingenious explanation, which Devaṇṇa Bhaṭṭa and [Mādhvācārya](# "'गान्धर्वादिविवाहेषु कन्यप्रदानाभावेन पितृगोत्रसापिण्ड्यनिवृतेः। तथा मार्कण्डेय पुराणम् ")' give, is foreclosed by Lakṣmīdhara's categorical condemnation of cross cousin marriages (infra, pp. 7, 9, and 10).

THE SAGOTRA AND SAPRAVARA PROHIBITION

Another prohibition of marriage within certain groups is based on remote consanguinity. All Brāhmaṇas are held to be descended from eight sages, who are the primeval ancestors. Their descendants are divided into **gaṇas** and **pakṣas**, and these again into gotras. Every gotra goes back theoretically in an unbroken line to one of the eight primary sages. **Gotras** are grouped in another way by association with the names of certain renowned sages, whose names are 'chosen' (**pravara**). No**gotra** has a **pravara** with more than five rṣis, and none with four. The **pravara** is defined as "the group of sages (muni) which distinguishes the sage who started the gotra from [another](# "प्रवरः गोत्रप्रवर्तकस्य मुनेः व्यावर्तको मुनिगणः। (पराशरमाधवीय, १. २,पृ. ७०)").The number of **pravaras** is stated by Baudhāyana to be only[forty-nine](# "गोत्राणां तु सहस्राणि प्रयुतान्यर्वुदानिच। उनपञ्चाशदेतेषां प्रवरा ऋषिदर्शनात्॥ (बौधायनश्रौतसूत्र, प्रवराध्याय). Cited by Kane, op. cit., II, p. 483."). A synonym for **pravara** is āṛseya. The rule of exogamy based on the two is that no one can marry within the same gotra or any one, whose **pravara** has even one name (of a sage) in common with the names in his **pravara**. Manu's rule (p. 7) prohibits the marriage of two persons of the same gotra. Gautama and Paṭhīnasīprohibit the union of persons of a common **pravara** (p. 8). Sumantu extends the prohibition by ruling that one who belongs to the same **gotra** or **pravura** as his mother, when she was a maiden, should not be taken in marriage. All agnatic relations belong of course to the same gotra and



**pravara**. As a maternal uncle will belong to the **gotra** and**pravara** of the mother of the bridegroom, before her marriage, the maternal uncle's daughter is barred both by **sapiṇḍa** relationship and by her being of the bridegroom's mother's pre-marital **gotra**. The adopted son drops his **gotra** of his natural father on passing to the family of the adopter, and loses claim to the property of his natural father, and loses also the liability to perform **śrāddhas** to those of his old family. But for purposes of marriage both his original and his acquired gotras have to be considered. The **gotra-pravara** rule of exclusion is absolute. A **sagotra** marriage is invalid.

 If such a marriage has taken place through ignorance or inadvertence, it is set aside and there is an expiation for the husband. The husband can have no further connubial intercourse with the wife. According to Baudhāyana (**inf**. p. 31) she should not be abandoned but maintained like a mother (**mātrvat enām bibhṛyāt**). A deliberate violation of the prohibition makes the husband an outcaste. The principle which is to be followed is indicated by Laksmīdhara (p. 31). If for any prohibition a reason is given, (**dṛstaguṇa**), it is only recommendatory. A rule for instance that a girl suffering from a disease should not be married will not set aside a marriage, if, in spite of the rule, the marriage has taken place. The wife cannot be discarded. The prohibition on an undisclosed reason (**adṛṣṭaguṇadoṣa**), for an invisible consequence, is on the other hand absolute. The interdiction of the**sapiṇḍa** and **sagotra** marriages come under this category. It is mandatory and beyond argument. The abandonment (**parityāga**) of a wife, who is married against these rules, does not mean that she should be turned adrift. It only means that she should be given up as a wife. She can have no further connubial intercourse with the husband, and she cannot associate herself with him in his sacramental and religious duties.

REQUISITE QUALITIES IN A BRIDE



As marriage is a sacrament, and is indissoluble except by death, and as the happiness as well as successful performance of one's duties depend upon it, the utmost care has to be exercised in selecting a partner. As the **snātaka** will be of sufficient age



and education, it is expected that he will pay due attention to the rules which are laid down for a proper choice of a bride. They are reproduced in great detail by Lakṣmīdhara, who has utilized only the dicta found in **smṛti** and **[purāṇa](# "He has for instance ignored the detailed rules in the Kamasūtra of Vātsyāyana who generally follows the Smṛtis, even to the point of regarding as marriage only Savarṇa unions. See H. C Chakladhar, Studies in Vātsyāyana's Kamasūtra, 1929, pp, 114-143,")**. Health is a primary consideration. There should be no family history of any heritable disease. The physical marks, which bode good or evil, if found in a girl were elaborated in **sāmudrikā-lakṣaṇa**, built by observation and induction. It included palmistry. Some of the rules of physiognomy are intelligible ; others rest only on authority. The underlying ideas are two : namely, that health, character and disposition are indicated by physical characteristics, and secondly that such marks contain a sure indication of the future of the person concerned, as well as those with whom she or he may be united. Besides the generalizations resting on such hypotheses, it was also noticed that mental, moral and physical traits reappeared in the same line from generation to generation, leading to the inference that they were transmissible. Eugenic rules were framed from study and observation. In the **Rāmāyaṇa** the auspicious marks on the body of Śri Rāma are described by Hanumān to Sītā in order to prove to her his intimate knowledge of the [hero](# " Sundarakaṇḍa, Sarga 35, śl, 15-20."). Belief in physiognomy was wide spread, and the long extract from **Bhaviṣya Purāṇa** (pp. 12-23) is merely illustrative. Its purpose is to caution the **snātaka** against making a hasty selection of a wife. The responsibility for selection rests on him and his friends. This is why **varapreṣaṇam** (sending persons to negotiate for the hand of a girl) is still an element in marriage ceremonies today, when the initiative is taken by the bride's father, and not by the [bridegroom](# "Kane, op. cit.. pp. 531-532. Varaṇa is not courtship.").



The **smṛtis** give some wholesome advice. Families in which certain diseases are prevalent are to be avoided (p. 25). Those in which religious sacraments have been omitted should be shunned, as those in which Vedic studies have been abandoned. Families which have few male members should be given the go-by too. A family in which licentiousness prevails must not be sought.



**(**p. 27, **kāmakulam)**. The quaint rule asking one not to think of a girl with certain classes of names may be based on the belief that the family in which such naming is common cannot be normal [(p. 27)](# "Vātsyāyana (p. 188) also rejects girls on the same ground e.g.नक्षत्राख्यां नदीनाम्नीं वृक्षानाम्नीं च गर्हिताम्। लकाररेफोपान्तां च वरणे परिवर्जयेत्॥").



A girl whose attachment is already pre-engaged (**anyatra āsaktacittā**, p. 28, the **manodattā**of p. 31) is obviously not likely to prove a happy partner if married against her wishes. Attention should be paid to the qualities of the parents.

QUALITIES OF THE BRIDEGROOM (pp. 32-37)

 The physical defects and traits for which a girl should not he chosen may also be considered as applicable, as far as possible, to men also (p. 32). Thus, the man who has got talked about in a scandal and the rake, or one whose affections are pledged to another girl, will come under Kātyāyana's specification of disqualifications (p. 28). Such quaint interdictions as those of the **Viṣṇupurāṇa** (p. 11) asking a girl with dimpled cheeks or a squint to be avoided may not have been strictly construed even against girls. The squint-eyed person, of either sex, is usually supposed to bring ill-luck to others. The outcaste, the habitual inebriate, the sadist, the sex-invert (**durbhagaḥ**), the man whom his relations have had to give up (**tyakta-bāndhavaḥ**), the person suffering from chronic or repulsive diseases, the cripple (**vyaṅga**), the habitual wanderer (**niṣkrāntaḥ**), the slave, the blind and the deaf, the epileptic (**apasmāra-dūṣitaḥ**), the person, who for the sake of a living has already assumed the marks of the order (**āsrama**, i.e., **gṛhasthāśrama**), and the leper are barred for marriage. As it is vital that a girl should be married only to one who is in every way fit, before the marriage ceremony is completed and the union becomes irrevocable, the discovery of defects in the bridegroom, like those catalogued, will necessitate the repudiation of the engagement, even after betrothal and before the marriage ceremony is begun (p. 33). Parity of birth is recommended (p. 34). First examine a man's ancestry, on both his father's and mother's side, enjoins Ãśvalāyana (p. 34), for knowledge, austerity, meritorious works etc. (Śrautasūtra, IX, 3, 20),



for ten generations. Yājñavalkya, (I, 55), insists on careful examination of the suitor's sex-fitness (**puṃstva**) and the idea is developed (with considerable knowledge of sex-physiology) by Nārada in a passage which has become classical (pp. 36-37) and which describes the different kinds of male impotency. Lakṣmīdhara explains the terms used in the passage, as the topic is of paramount personal and legal importance (p. 37). Nārada rules that of the fourteen types of impotent persons, both curable and incurable, a period of time should be given to those whose incapacity is curable so as to enable them to overcome the disability. At the end of the period, if the man is not cured, he is to be given up and another partner found for the girl (XII, 18). The law is attributed by Nārada to Prajāpati (the Creator) and therefore has divine sanction (p. 36). "Women have been created for propagation of children. Woman is the field and men are the seed-givers (**bījinaḥ**). The field should go only to one who has the seed ; he who has no seed (a-bīji), does not deserve to get the field." (**inf**. p. 37). Lakṣmīdhara's application of the rules are lucidly stated (p. 37). "To any man coming within these (fourteen kinds of impotent persons), a girl should not be given in marriage, if the defects have been discovered before marriage. But, if through ignorance of his condition, a girl has been given in marriage to him, the period indicated (by Nārada) for treatment of the defect should be allowed to pass (in order to give time for the cure to have effect) if, the defect is curable ; if it is incurable (or is not cured), the gift (of the bride) should be annulled, and the girl given away to another person." The betrothal will be given up, if the suitor's impotency or other defects are found out in time, **i.e**., before the marriage; and even after the betrothal **(vāgdānāntaram)**, the **kanyādāna**, which has been arranged, should be cancelled. This may come under the law of gifts. A gift which has been promised will have to be given, if one is not to incur the punishment prescribed for breach of promise. But in the treatment of **dattāpradānikam**, as one of the eighteen titles of **vyavahāra**, Lakṣmīdhara cites the dictum of Nārada that a gift is no gift, **i.e.**, is invalid, which has been given in ignorance or, in error, **e.g.**, to an unworthy person, who is thought worthy, or for a purpose wrongly deemed virtuous. (IV, 11 trn. p. 130). The gift of a bride is meritorious, but it



is solely for raising progeny. He who secures the gift, or is given the gift of a girl, in the wrong belief that he is virile, and is found to be not so, automatically loses the right to enforce the gift. What is more, the gift itself loses its character as a gift. This is stated in the **Vyavahārakāṇḍa**. In the **Gṛhasthakāṇḍa**, in which Lakṣmīdhara deals with the relations of husband and wife, which are usually dealt with under **Vyavahāra** by others, he further developes the law on the subject. A girl married in error, and remarried, as allowed by Nārada, is declared to be not at all blameworthy. If the failure to disclose defects invalidating marriage is the suitor's, not only is the union annulled, but the suitor is punished. Similarly, if a girl is married to a man, without disclosing her faults (**doṣa**) she can not be set aside, and must be maintained, but the father, who withheld the information or misled the suitor is punished, and the **śulka** paid by the bride-groom is returned. The regulations are considerate to the woman. **Patria potestas** shrivels up on parental negligence of duty to daughter.

LAW OF BETROTHAL

 In the case of **Āsura-vivāha**, even after the acceptance of the bride-price by the father, if he secures another suitor, better than the original in religious merit, fortune and amiability, the engagement already made can be set aside (p. 57), even though the promise was to give her to the first suitor for Dharma, Artha and Kāma. The dictum is that of Nārada, and it is also laid down by Yājñavalkya. Retraction of a promise made in betrothal is ordinarily improper but so is the sale of a girl, i.e., marriage in Āsura form [(Manu, IX, 99-100)](# "मनुः (९,९९-१००) यथा—एतत्तु न परे चक्रुः नापरे जातु साधवः। यदन्यस्य प्रतिज्ञाय पुनरन्यस्य दीयते॥ नानुशुश्रुम जात्वेतत् पूर्वेष्वपि च जन्मसु। शुल्कसंज्ञेन मूल्येन छन्नं दुहितृविक्रयम्॥"). If the father of a girl withdraws his promise to give her in marriage to a man, who has no faults of the kind specified, which will justify the cancellation of betrothal, he is punishable and must make good the expenses incurred by the discarded suitor (p. 57). Good men do not back out of promises ; a breach of a promise is culpable and



counts as **puruṣānṛta**, whose heinousness is a thousand-fold that of an ordinary offence (Ib. VIII, 98; p. 58). It leads the girl's guardian to hell (p. 58). If a girl has been promised in marriage to several persons in succession, the person to whom the first promise was made should get her (p. 58). If, after accepting the offer of girl in marriage, a suitor goes away to another country, the girl should wait for three months, and then select another suitor. If, within this period, she is married to a second person, the marriage is void, and the first suitor shall have her. (p. 60). A girl, whose betrothed dies before the ceremony of marriage, remains a **kaṇyā** under parental control. This will be so even if the betrothal was made by libation as well as by verbal promise, provided she has not been married with **mantras**. (**Vasiṣṭha**, p. 61). In the case of an Āsura marriage, in which a bride-price has been paid, if the betrothed suitor dies, his brother may marry the girl, if she be willing. This is different from **Niyoga** (p. 61). If a girl is married with due ritual, but is subsequently discovered to have grave disqualifications, she may be given up (**tyaktavyā**) if the marriage has not been consummated, but if it has been, she must be given maintenance (**bhartavyā**). Manu alludes to cases of false personation in marriage in which a person other than the betrothed girl is substituted during the ceremony. Such a substitute, even if correctly married according to ritual, may be abandoned. (p. 64). The nuptial ritual is restricted to virgin-marriages. One who is not a virgin should be taken without **mantras**. (Manu, VIII, 226, p. 64).

THE MARRIAGE RITES



The details of the marriage ritual are laid down in the **Gṛhyasūtras**, and the bride's **Gṛhyasūtra** is to be followed up to the completion of 'the seven steps' (**Saptapadī**). Lakṣmīdhara indicates by appropriate citation the really decisive factors in the rites (pp. 64-69). Among them are the benediction (**svastyayanam**), the **Prajāpati-homa** intended to invoke the Creator's blessing, the reception of the bridegroom by giving him a seat, **arghya**, salutation and other hospitality signs, the **vara-preṣaṇa** ceremony (friends of the suitor making an offer of marriage), the repetition of the lineage of the bride for three generations in



order to describe her, by or on behalf of the bridegroom, the the response of the donor of the bride (the father) reciting the lineage of both parties, and agreeing to make a gift of the bride, the gift of the bride with libation of water, (**kanyādānam)** followed by the clasping of the palms of the bride and bridegroom by the fingers (**pāṇigrahaṇa**) with appropriate **mantras**, and circumambulation of the sacred fire by bride and bridegroom with hands clasped, ending in the taking of seven steps (**sapta-padī**).

 On the effect of these, Lakṣmīdhara states his views thus. Even after the reception of the bridegroom at the ceremony, and the betrothal verbally and by libation, the status of the girl as a **kanyā**is not lost. That is, even at that stage, if it be discovered that the bridegroom has disqualifications, such as impotency, disease, etc., the ceremony may stop, and the girl remain free to marry another. (p. 66). The view that after the offer of her is made and is accepted the marriage is over is incorrect. It has still to be followed by the actual gift and acceptance (**parigraha**) which only complete the surrender of the father's authority over the girl, and the accrual of dominion over her to the donee [(p. 65)](# "cf. Vasiṣṭha, XVII, 74—पाणिग्रहे मृते बाला केवलं मन्त्रसंस्कृता। सा बेदक्षतयोनिस्स्यात् पुनस्संस्कारमर्हति॥"). The ceremony of 'clasping hands' does not itself make the parties husband and wife. It is taking the 'seven steps' which completes the marriage and makes them so. After the **saptapadī** the marriage is irrevocable.

 Some details are enjoined. The gift is to be made with water (**adbhiḥ**) where the parties are Brāhmaṇas. The pouring completes the gift. For other castes mutual love completes it (**parasparānurāgeṇā**). The bridegroom, in suing for the gift of the girl, is to stand facing west (as the girl will be seated, on her father's lap, facing east) ; and she should be accepted by the bridegroom facing east, i.e. he should take his seat, facing east, and the fatherinlaw standing and facing west, should make the gift of the girl, the water being poured, in ratification of the gift, by the girl's mother.



If a Brāhmaṇa marries one of his own **varṇa**, the bride should clasp his fingers (**pāṇigrahaṇa**). If the bride is of other



**varṇas**, the procedure is different. A Kṣatriya bride will take hold of the husband with an arrow, the Vaisya bride by a goad (**pratoda**) and a **Śūdrā** by the hem of his garment. The Brāhmaṇa bride goes with her husband round the **fire**, while the others make only the circum-ambulation of the Preceptor (**Ācārya**, p. 68). In the case of a Śūdra bride the Vedic **mantras** should be [omitted](# "उदकपूर्वं कन्यादानस्य शूद्रे विकल्पः। तदुक्तं स्मृतिकौमुद्यां ब्राह्मे। युक्तं तु पाणिग्रहणं सर्ववर्णेषु सर्वशः। जलपूर्वं तु विप्राणां अन्येषामपि काम्यया॥ (शुद्रकमालाकर, ed. Nirṇayasāgara, p 109) Manu interdicts mantras for even dvija girls, who have lost their virginity : पाणिग्रहणिका मन्त्राः कन्यास्येव प्रतिष्ठिताः। नाऽकन्यासु क्वचिन्नृृणां कुसधर्मक्रिया हि ताः॥ (८, २२६)."). Taking the seven steps with appropriate **mantras** is prescribed as the decisive rite for the **Dvijas**, while the Śūdras have to make the circle, and take the decisive seven steps silently. Wifehood springs from the **pāṇigrahaṇa** and husbandhood from **saptapadi** (p. 67).

POST-PUBERTY MARRIAGE WHEN ALLOWED

 Many of the physical and mental characteristics, which are indicated as necessary or desirable in a bride, are likely to be perceptible only after she grows up. They cannot be discovered in a girl of eight or ten years of age. Even stature cannot be predicted in childhood. Adolescence makes even more changes in girls than in boys. The injunction of Āśvalāyana (I, 5) that one should secure as a bride a girl who is endowed with powers of discrimination (**buddhi**), good habits (**śīla**) and marks (**lakṣaṇa**) is explained by Lakṣmīdhara (p. 11) as referring to one possessing the marks detailed in the **Bhavisyapuraṇa**, from which he quotes a long extract, which has to be read, in his opinion, with the smrti rules determining the bride's fitness. Among the marks dealt with by the **purāṇa** is pubic hair (**ūrdhvaroma bhage yasyāḥ**, p. 14) and heavy breasts, whose weight bends the body (p. 15, **payodhara bharānnamrā**), fully grown breasts (p. 61) etc. These indicate a young woman, not an immature girl. Though the **purāṇa** deals with the good or bad fate awaiting a woman (**strī**) with certain physical marks, the deliberate association of the statements in the **purāṇic** extract with **kanyā-lakṣana** by Lakṣmidhara can have no relevancy unless he had in view also brides



who were grown-up young women. A girl who has attained puberty is termed **rohiṇī**(adolescent, grown-up), one who has not yet done so but is approaching it **gaurī**, a girl the swell of whose breasts is hardly discernible **syāmā**, and one without any sign of breasts a **nagnikā** (p. 53). The **Bhaviṣyapurāṇa** would call the **syāmā, kanyakā**, the limit of whose age is twelve (p. 52). An extract from the **Mahābhārata**, quoted on p. 45, indicates the age of sixteen as the proper one for a bride who is to marry a man of thirty. In commenting on the age proportions (**vayaḥkramanirṇaya**) Lakṣmīdhara (p. 46) states that where the difference in the ages of the bride and the bridegroom is not as wide as recommended, the bride will still be a **patnī** though not well (i.e., sacramentally) qualified to bear progeny, and that what is essential even when the rules are not followed **(dharmepi sīdati sati)** is that the bride should be younger than the husband.

 Marriage is a sacrament for women. This is why it is termed **strī-vivāha**, taking away the girl specially, i.e., for a special purpose, namely for making her a wife (**inf**. p. 70). It is not only the most important event in a woman's life but it is the most important of all **samskāras** (rites of purification or preparation) for women. This is why an unmarried girl can still be termed a **kanyā**, as Kunti was called even after the birth of her first child **Karṇa**, who was styled **kānīna** (son of a kanyā). The term **kanyā** does not mean 'virgin' but indicates one who has not undergone the marriage rite (**vivāha-samskāra**). **Kanyā-bhāva** is lost, in the opinion of some, not by sex intercourse, but by undergoing the **samskāra** of marriage [(**Medhātithi on Manusmṛti, III, 34**)](# "Medhātith (III. 34) takes the commonsense view that Kanyābhāva goes with virginity, but he regards the Samskāra of marriage to be necessary, where the love-making approach (upagamana) stops short of actual copulation. (ed Jha, pp. 223-224.)"). It is a solecism to speak of man's marriage, (**vivāha**) as he is not 'taken away' as the girl is. As a woman is always under subjection, her marriage has to be arranged by others. The donors of a girl have not only the right to give her away, but they are under a duty to do so. The duty devolves on guardians in a specified order : father, paternal grand-father, brother, agnate, and mother (according to Yājñavalkya, I, 63, p. 46). **Viṣnusmṛtī** **(XXIV, 38-39)** gives the maternal grandfather the right and duty



of donation before the mother. Lakṣmīdhara holds that the duty vests in father and agnates in the case of **aurasa** daughters (i.e., daughters born of wives of the same **varṇa** as the fathers), in mother's father, in the case of **a-savarṇa** off-spring, and on the mother in the case of a daughter born of a **niyoga** union. The duty is cast on the mother, who has either no place in the list of donors in marriage or only the lowest place, only when the adult agnatic relations on whom the duty is cast have long been absent from the home of the daughter (p. 47). The apparently low position of the mother is so when one views giving away a girl or arranging her marriage as a **privilege** ; but, if it be viewed as an **obligation** of a religious nature and if omission to fulfil it makes those on whom it is laid liable to sin and expiation, the mother may be considered as treated with special consideration in view of her dependant position in thus being put low in the order of a compulsory duty. Modern Hindu Law has given her a high place by mistaking **duty** for **right**. Dharmaśāstra invariably places the mother above the father, and even the preceptor (**ācārya**). Common sense will show that a mother is more anxious about her daughter's wedding than a father can be. She would supply the stimulus (as she still does when the male guardians are indifferent) which brings about the marriage of her daughter. But, if the marriage is delayed, hers is not the moral responsibility but that of the males of the families. By delaying her marriage beyond puberty, a girl acquires the taint of being equated with a Śūdra girl (**vṛsaḷī**). But, the guardians of the girl incur both sin and public odium, as those who have incurred the sin of **bhrūṇahatti**, **i.e**., a sin equal to that of bringing about the destruction of a human embryo. Prompt payment of the ordained gift to the teacher is enjoined to the student on the termination of his studentship **(brahmacarya**). If the payment is made later, it recoils on the student. So does delay in giving away a bride, the sufferers being her **male** guardians. The father incurs odium and sin by keeping a girl after puberty unmarried (p. 51). The sin of infanticide accrues if for three years a grown-up girl is kept unwedded, because no one has come forward to marry her, but if a good offer to marry her is turned down by the guardian, his moral culpability is increased, and with every month of her continuing unmarried,



he incurs the sin of killing a **Brāhmaṇa**. So declares **Lakṣmīdhara** (p. 52). The girl is enjoined to notify to her guardians her puberty, so that they may have no excuse and plead ignorance of it. The dicta collected by **Lakṣmīdhara** reflect his own view that pre-puberty marriage is the right thing.

KANYĀ-SVAYAMVARA (THE MAIDEN'S CHOICE)

 The negligence of relations should not deprive a girl of the opportunity to obtain the long delayed **samskára**. Accordingly, her legally dependent position ceases for one special purpose, **viz**., to get married. If she has no guardians, she can approach the king and with his sanction choose her partner, from men of her own caste, (p. 48), possessing proper qualifications (**gamyam varam āśrayet,** p. 48). The application to the king is made because of the idea that he is the father of the fatherless, the guardian of those who have no guardians. But, if she has guardians, she must not make her own choice, for three months after puberty (three **ṛtus**) if the guardians are openly indifferent to their duty and will not give her away in marriage even when a suitable party is available, (**yatoktavarasampattau api pitṛādiñaṁ upekṣāyām**), and for three years, if the marriage is not possible through their active efforts. A guardian who refuses his ward to a good suitor of equal rank etc., is unnatural, and has no ground to complain if the girl chooses a husband herself. By doing so she incurs no blame while he will still incur sin and also odium for his neglect.



If such a girl is married, her husband incurs no sin by marrying a grown-up girl, who had attained puberty, nor is she herself to blame for acting independently of her guardians (p. 48). Her father or guardian cannot treat the union as an Āsura marriage and demand a bride-price (**śulka**) from her husband. (Manu, IX, 92, p. 48). Nor can she take away the ornaments given her by her parents or brothers, as to do so will be tantamount to theft (**steyam syāt yadi tam haret**, ib. IX, 91). Necessity as well as parental neglect should force her to the step, not a clandestine agreement to elope with a lover carrying away her jewellery like Jessica in Shakespeare's **Merchant of Venice.**



 A runaway marriage, even before this period, if actually

performed in one of the first five forms, is final and indissoluble. (Manu, IX, 47, p. 56), but in the other three, according to Nārada (XII, 28) a confirmation by subsequent gift will be necessary for ratification. In a **svyam-dattā's** case it will be obviously unnecessary, though she might perhaps receive a **locus penitentiae**, in such a case, if after offering herself she discovers the suitor to be unworthy.



A **svayamvara** is an **authorized** form of post-puberty marriage. It is to be distinguished from a royal **svayamvara,** which is also a post-puberty affair, but obviously not due to parental neglect. It confers distinction on the celebrant as well as on the selected bridegroom. It stands in a class by itself and does not appear to be covered by **smṛti** rules. It has again to be distinguished from the gift of a princess as the prize in a competition (**vīrya-sulka**), as was the case with Sītāand Draupadī.

SELECTION BY DIVINATION

 In **Āśvalāyana-Gṛhyasūtra** (I, 5) in the section in which the suitor is advised as to choose a bride with specified qualities **viz**. intelligence, conduct etc., he is further told that, if he finds it difficult to pursue his enquiries on the subject, he might resort to divination by lumps of earth. After reciting a **mantra**, which is specified, as an invocation, he is to make eight balls, with earth taken from different spots, e.g. a field yielding annually two crops, a cow-pen, an altar (**vedī**), a pond that does not dry up, gambling den, cross-roads, barren land, and a burial ground. The girl is to be asked to choose one of the lumps, and her future will be indicated by it. If she chooses the lump made of the earth of the pool she will be rich in everything, a gambler if she selects the lump made up of the earth of the gambling den, and become a widow if she takes the ball made up of the earth from a burial ground.



Lakṣmīdhara quotes the entire passage. He probably meant it to be illustrative. It will be noticed that the divination claims like physiognomy to reveal the hidden fate of the girl. The effect of including such a test will be to support withdrawal



from a promise to marry, on the ground of an apprehension generated by the result of a test laid down in an ancient [**Kalpasūtra**](# "यथा कामसूत्रे ( ३, १, १९ )—दैवं परीक्षणं चावधिं स्थापयेयुराप्रदाननिश्वयात्'॥ Jayamaṅgala cites an anonymous verse which summarizes the precepts of Āśvalāyana (p. 167, ed. Kaśl.)").

 It may be noted that while such tests and rules of physiognomy are given by Lakṣmīdhara, he has omitted all reference to the astrological agreement between the horoscopes of the bride and bridegroom, which is now considered most important in settling marriages in India. The **Gṛhyasūtras** indicate proper times, constellations and lunar conjunctions for different rites, including marriage. Lakṣmīdhara, who will not quote works of human authorship like those extant in his day in Arthaśāstra, must have deliberately omitted a treatment for which there is no authority either in **sūtra** or **smṛti**. Like the details of ritual (**prayoga**), they were matters for the priest, who directs the ceremony of marriage.

FORMS OF MARRIAGE (VIVĀHA-BHEDĀḤ)

 Certain features of marriage emerge on a review of the authorities collected in **nibandhas**. It is a **samskāra**, and one for women only. Without it they are not rid of the impurity clinging to birth. The wedded estate (**garhastya**) is holy for the man also, as by it alone he can discharge the debts which he is born in. But it is impossible without marriage. All religious rites, including the tending of the household fire, depend on the wife. When the wife dies before the husband, she "takes away the fire" kindled by husband and wife jointly at their wedding. Till he gets another fire, he is fire-less" [(Manu, V, 168-169)](# "एवं वृत्तां सवर्णो स्त्रीं द्विजातिः पूर्वमारिणीम्। दाहयेदग्निहोत्रेण यज्ञापात्रैश्च धर्मवित्॥ भार्यायै पूर्वमारिण्यै दत्वाऽग्नीनन्त्यकर्मणि। पुनर्दारक्रियां कुर्यात् पुनराधानमेव च॥ (५, १, ६६-१६७)"). By making a gift of a girl to a qualified person of equal **varṇa** and prescribed qualities, a father obtains the merit springing from both good acts, besides reaping the reward of continuing his line on



the female [side](# "A dauhitra (daughter's son) also redeems his mother's father. See quotation from the Ādityapuraṇa on p. 434."). The primary aims of marriage are unworldly and [un-carnal](# "यथा कामसूत्रे (१३. १, १ ) तु—सवर्णायामनन्यपूर्वायां शास्त्रतोऽधिगतायां धर्मोऽर्थः पुत्राः सम्बन्धः पक्षवृद्धिरनुपस्कृता रतिश्च॥"). A gift, to merit its name, must be made without any expectation of a return, to suitable person, at a suitable time and in a proper [manner](# "यथा भगवद्गीतासु (१७, २०२२) यथा—दातव्यमिति यद्दानं दीयतेऽनुपकारिणे। देशे काले च पात्रे च तद्दानं सात्विकं स्मृतम्॥ यत्तु प्रत्युपकारार्थंफलमुद्दिश्य वा पुनः। दीयते च परिक्लिष्टं तद्दानं राजसं स्मृतम्॥ अदेशकाले यद्दानमपात्रेभ्यश्च दीयते। असत्कृतमवज्ञातं तत्तामसमुदाहृतम्॥") and without any condition or reservation. The union of husband and wife is the result of the mystic ceremony of **saptapadī**. There is no element of contract in it. Such reciprocal duties as spring from marriage are not due to any agreement between the parties. The imposition of any condition, or the acceptance of any consideration or worldly advantage for giving a girl to a suitor lowers the level of the marriage. So does a union which is primarily or solely due to sex impulse. The consequences of enjoined acts are invisible (**adṛsṭaphala**). A visible benefit is inferior to an unseen. A marriage has two steps : the gift of the bride (**kanyādāna**) and the subsequent ceremony of **udvāha**. Both have results of an invisible kind, beneficial or harmful, according to the circumstances attending each.

TYPES OF MARRIAGE

 These principles are illustrated in the different types of marriage, which following usage have been classed as eight or six. The eight are :



\(1\) the **Brāhma**, in which a girl under the prescribed age limit is given away along with presents, decked with ornaments, to a fully qualified and deserving **Brahmacārin**, who has kept his vows and who has been invited by the father of the girl to receive her as a gift ;



\(2\) the **Daiva**, in which a sacrificer presents his daughter, duly adorned to the **ṛtvik** (priest) who presides at the **yajña**; and the gift is made within the sacrificial enclosure (**antarvedi**) ;



 (3) the **Ārṣa**, in which the girl is presented, in accordance with prescribed ritual, to the bridegroom after he gives the father of the bride a bull and a cow, or a pair of them, before he does the **lāja-homam** (Baudhāyana, I, 20, 4, p. 84);

 (4) the **Prājāpatya,** in which the girl is given to a suitor who has asked for her hand, after the bridegroom has agreed to abide by certain conditions dictated by the father of the girl;

 (5) the **Āsura** in which the father of the bride and his relations receive abundant wealth from the suitor, before giving his daughter to the suitor;

 (6) the **Gāndharva**, where inspired by mutual love, the suitor and the girl are united;

 (7) the **Rākṣasa**, in which the bride is forcibly taken away by the bridegroom, after committing violence on her folk or pretending to do so, the bride crying (or professing to cry) for help; and



\(8\) lastly, the **Paiśāca,** in which a girl, who is lying asleep or intoxicated or

unconscious is approached (**upagama**) in secret by a man, who abducts her.



Sometimes, the features of two types may be found mixed up. Thus, if a father refuses to give his daughter to a suitor, whom she loves, she may incite him to carry her away by force. Then the union will be a mixture of the **Gandharva** and **Rākṣasa** forms (p. 73).

 The quality of a type must be suited to the quality of a suitor, as indicated by his caste. Thus, the first four are universally approved as proper (**dharmya, praśasta**) for the Brāhmaṇa, and the **Rākṣasa** form, in which prowess is displayed in winning the bride, is regarded as essentially suited to the Kṣatriya. Manu will permit both the **Prājāpatya** and the **Gāndharva** forms also to the Brāhmaṇa (p. 72), and all the last four to the Kşatriya, though in his view the **Gāndharva** and **Rākṣasa** types are best suited to the [Kṣatriya](# "महाभारते, आदिपर्वणि, अर्जुनं प्रति श्रीकृष्णवचनं यथा—प्रसाह्यहरणं चाऽपि क्षत्रियाणां प्रशस्यते। विवाहहेतुः शूराणामिति धर्मविदो विदुः॥ (२१९, २२) कामसूत्रे (३, ५, २९-३०) यथा—व्यूढानां हि विवाहानां अनुरागः फलं यतः। मध्यमोऽपिहि सद्योगो गान्धर्बस्तेन पूजितः॥ सुखत्वादबहुक्लेशादपि चावरणादिह। अनुरागात्मकत्वाच्च गान्धर्वः प्रवरो मतः॥"). He makes the



general rule that for every caste the **Paiśāca** and **Āsura** forms must be deemed worthy of rejection. Paiṭhīnisi (p. 73) curiously allows the **Āsura** for the Kṣatriya (omitting the **Rākṣasa**, which others regard as fit for a martial caste) and the **Paiśāca** for the Śūdra. Baudhāyana (p. 74) considers **Gāndharva** and **Pāiśāca** as fit for the Vaiśya and Śūdra, and the **Āsura** and **Rākṣasa** for the Kṣatriya. The last four 'sinful' (**papīyān**) for the Brāhmaṇa, each succeeding one being more sinful than the preceding. The praise by some of the **Gāndharva** is justified on the ground that it is based on mutual love. The fitness of **Paiśāca** and **Gāndharva** forms to the last two castes is explained on the ground that their women are not secluded, and the sexes are thrown more together among them than in other castes, leading to opportunities for forming attachments (**snehānugata**). Nārada reconciles apparent contradictions on the subject thus : the first four are very suitable to the Brāhmaṇa, while the **Gāndharva** is not objectionable (**a-virodhī**); though Manu has allowed the **Āsura** form to the Brāhmaṇa, it is inferior in merit to the **Gāndharva**, and should be availed of only if the other forms of union are not available to him (p. 75); Hārīta's preference for **Gāndharva** "for all" (**sarvān prati**) is applicable only to the public choice of a **svayamvara**, as in his own words (p. 92) the **svayamvara** is **Gāndharva** ; and only the indication of prowess to be displayed by the suitor in acquiring the bride is contained in such descriptive epithets as **Rākṣasa, Kṣātra, Paiśāca** and **Āsuru** (p. 75). The Brāhma and Daiva are restricted to Brāhmaṇas, and are not available to others. This is intelligible as the distinguishing feature of the two is a **dāna** (gift), and only the Brāhmaṇa is competent to receive [**dāna**](# " उदकपूर्वं कन्यादानस्य शूद्रे विकल्पः। एतेन भवति। 'अलङ्कृत्य कन्यामुदकपूर्वो दद्यादेष ब्राह्मो बिवाहः इति आश्वलायनेन (गृ.सू. १, ६, १) ब्राह्म एषजलपूर्वतोक्तेः॥ (शद्रकमलाकर, पृ. ११०). Lakṣmidhara is stricter."). There can be **kanyādāna** only in the first caste, strictly speaking (p. 76). A **Kṣatriya** cannot be a **ṛtvik** and is accordingly barred from the **Daiva** form. The availability of the **Rākṣasa** form to the Vaiśya is to be understood as his freedom to use 'force' i.e., the king's influence or threat, which is equal to force and makes a union **Rākṣasa**, even though there is no actual violence used in carrying



away the bride, p. 93) if he cannot secure the girl by the **Āsura** form, i.e., by the offer of a bride-price (**śulka**). For mixed castes (**saṅkarajāḥ**) the first two types should not be used.



The principle underlying the prescriptions is that good results, viz., the unseen benefits (**adṛṣṭa-phala**) and good progeny results only from marriages that are proper (**dharmya**) to a caste.

FEATURES OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES

 Some features of the different types may be noted. According to Baudhāyana (p. 79) the mark of the **Brāhma** form is donation to a Brahmacārī, who has kept celibate and solicits the gift (**arthine**). According to Śaṅkha-Likhita (p. 79) the bride of the Brāhmaṇa for this form should be a **nagnikā** of the same caste. Marriage gifts to the girl by her father are recommended in this type. Prestige, the spiritual merit of many **Jyotiṣṭhoma** and **Atirātra** sacrifices and of the gifts of many boats and chariots, and a place after death in Heaven equal to that of the Patriarch Dakṣa, accrue to the donor in a **Brāhma** marriage. A father and a mother are sure of heaven after such a **dāna**. The fruits of **kanyadāna** accrue from this type alone. The relative inferiority of the **Daiva** and **Āsura** forms is due to the taint of reciprocity which adheres to them, as the gift of the girl is to one who has rendered service to the donor as priest, or who gives a stated ceremonial present to the father, in the form of **gomithuna**. The **Prājāpatya** form is tainted by the imposition of a contract (**samaya**) on the suitor, whereas a gift should be absolutely unconditional. Contract degrades marriage. A bride-price exacted openly, or secretly, when the father boasts he has not received any return, is also an **Āsura** marriage (p. 87). A girl who is bought (**kritā**) does not rank as a **patnī**; she is only a slave-girl, and is unfit for both secular and religious rites, rules **Kāśyapa** (p. 88). Vasiṣṭha (p. 87) appears to give Vedic sanction for the sale of a girl, though the passage, as cited from Āpastamba (D. S., II, 6. 12, p. 90) ends with an injunction negativing the appearance of sale byimposing on the father the duty of returning the amount to the giver.



**Āpastamba** roundly [states](# "आ. घ. सू, ६, १३, १०—दानं क्रयधर्माश्चऽपत्यस्य न विद्यते॥ तथैव याज्ञवल्क्यः, ३, २३६—नास्तिक्यं व्रतलोपश्चसुतानाञ्चैव विक्रयः॥") that the gift or sale of a child is forbidden. This rule outlaws not only **Āsura** marriage but adoption [also](# "Haradatta explains the prohibition as that of the eldest or only son in adoption:—ज्येष्ठपुत्रविषयः, एकपुत्रविषयः, स्त्रीविषयो वा। विक्रयस्तु सर्वत्र निषिद्धः। (पृ.२३१)"). The **Āsura** form is termed **Mānuṣa** to denote its inferiority. Even a Śūdra should not accept a bride-price (p. 89). It is not merely the sale of a daughter but of oneself **(ātmavikraya)**. Elopement is **Gāndharva** union. The **Rākṣasa** form is termed **Kṣātra,** as it reflects the prowess of the suitor who wins his bride like a warrior. In the **Paiśāca** form, according to Manu, the suitor should not violate the girl, who is drugged or unconscious [(p. 94)](# " This is also Medhātithi's view of Upayamana, as a Kṣatayoni cannot have Vivaha-Samskara (Manu, VIII, 226)."). If the hymen is ruptured, the girl becomes unfit for the subsequent validating ceremony of 'clasping hands' (**pāṇigrahaṇa**). According to Hārīta, the drugging etc., need not be of the girl, but of the relations, who would be inattentive or unconscious when the girl, is spirited away (p. 95). The essence of the Paiśāca form is not violence or rape but deception (paiśācaḥ cchālāt, pp. 95).**⁴** A girl who has been abducted by force or by guile, if not already wedded by **mantras**, might, on recovery by her guardians, be married according to prescribed formalities (**vidhivat**) to a person other than the abductor. This is only permissive. Ordinarily, the abductor will be asked to marry the girl formally, in the last four forms of marriage (p. 97). In the first four forms, the bride is led to the bridegroom's house after the conclusion of the marriage **yajña**, in the last four the **yajña** follows cohabitation. Both are ordained, according to **Āśvalāyana** (p. 97). The different types of union purify ancestors and descendants for ten to three generations, on both sides. The children born of the higher forms of marriage will be endowed with good qualities, and those sprung of the lower will be devoid of them (p. 100). Those who stoop to lower forms of union, when higher are available, will naturally not be of the morally elect, and their offspring cannot be expected to be better than their parents.

CONSUMMATION OF MARRIAGE

 The newly married are enjoined not to live as husband and wife for varying periods, according to the age of the bride. In the marriage ceremony itself, they should both observe continence, avoid pungent and salt food for three nights, and lie on the bare ground. In the **Gṛhyasūtras**, certain rites, suggestive of sexual intercourse, are prescribed for the fourth night. These are known as **caturthī-karma**. That this can be done only if the girl was of age is seen by the alternatives of continence for twelve days or one year after the marriage prescribed by Āśvalāyana (p. 100). The rule is elaborated in the extract from the **Brahmapurāṇa**, which Lakṣmīdhara has given (pp. 100-101). If the bride is eight years of age and the bridegroom, twenty four, the **brahmacarya** (period of continence) should last for atleast a year. If the bride is turned twelve (the usual age for puberty), the period is shortened to twelve days, to six days if the bride is sixteen, and to three days (as indicated in the **Gṛhyasūtras**) if she is twenty. The drift of the injunction is that there should be no consummation of marriage, immediately after the ceremony, unless the bride is quite nubible. The recitation of mantras regarding conception at the marriage ceremony is only precautionary, in case the bride is grown-up, and the rule of continence is not observed. As Lakṣmīdhara regards pre-puberty marriage as the only correct form, his furnishing the rules for consummation of marriage should be regarded as providing for exceptional cases in which a girl has to wait long after puberty for her marriage.

MARRIAGE OF A SECOND WIFE (ADHIVEDANA)

 Marriage being for progeny primarily, and secondarily for the society and service of a wife, the union is conceived as normally monogamous. Nārada directs the king to restrain a husband who wishes to leave a wife who is obedient, pleasant-spoken, skilful in household work, chaste, and the mother of sons, and inflict on the husband a severe punishment (p. 105). The word "**avasthāpya**" used to describe the mode of the king's intervention implies that the marriage of another wife can be



prevented. There should be definite and clear cause of a spiritual as well as of a worldly nature to justify the supersession of a wife. Barrenness and the birth of only daughters defeat the religious purpose of marriage, as the discharge of the triplc debt and the release of ancestors from post-mortuary torments is held to be brought about only by the continuation of the line through sons. But, before a wife is superseded for these defects, the husband must wait for ten and twelve years respectively, and for eight years if she has reached the menopause (**atiprasavā**). The periods are illustrative and must take effect according to the age of the wife, says Lakṣmīdhara (p. 104) ; a sufficient time must be afforded the wife to make it clear that the defect is lasting. On the worldly side the grounds of supersession are drunkenness, evil disposition, cruelty, wastefulness, unchastity, and dislike of the husband. Apparently these are held as inferior in gravity to the religious disqualifications. Whatever be the cause, the wife, who has to give room for another wife, cannot be discarded. She must be maintained (**adhivinnātu bhartavyā**) ; not to do so will be to incur grave sin (p. 102). According to Yājñavalkya a superseded wife should receive from her husband a sum equal to the expenses of her marriage or, according to the interpretation of Lakṣmīdhara, as much as the new wife receives as wedding gift (p. 105). This is the view also of Vijñāneśvara (II, 148). In the case of a good wife, who is begetting only daughters or who is suffering from an incurable malady, her feelings should be considered by the husband, and a new wife taken only with her permission. A wife so superseded, who quits in anger the husband's home, can be compelled to go back to it, and if she is recalcitrant, she can be given up (**tyājyā**) in the presence of the assembled family (p. 105). Dharmaśāstra has always looked down on polygamy in the case of ordinary persons, allowing or condoning it only in the case of kings. The rights of the superseded wife are further dealt with by Lakşmidhara in the **Vyavahārakāṇḍa.**

PRECEDENCE AMONG WIVES

 The question of precedence among wives, where a man has at the same time several, either of his own **varṇa** or inferior



**varṇas**, is dealt with in smṛtis. [**Viṣṇusmṛti**](# "सवर्णासु बहुभार्यासु विद्यमानासु ज्येष्ठया सह धर्मकार्यं कुर्यात्। मिश्रासु कनिष्ठायामपि समानवर्णयाम्। समानवर्णायाऽभावे त्वनन्तरया एवापदि चा न त्वेव द्विजः शूद्रया (विष्णुस्मृति, २६, १.४)") states the order clearly. The wife whose marriage took place first is senior, if all wives are **savarṇāḥ**, and she is his **Dharmapatnī**or **patnī**, the one entitled to officiate with him in all religious acts. This is irrespective of their relative ages. [Manu](# " मनु, ९, ८६-८७, यथा—भर्तुः शरीरशुश्रूषां धर्मकार्यं च नैत्यकम्।स्वा चैव कुर्यात्सर्वेषां नास्वजातिः कथञ्चन॥ यस्तु तत्कारयेन्मोहात् सजात्या स्थितयाऽन्यया। यथा ब्राह्मणचण्डालः पूर्वदृष्टस्तथैव सः॥") lays down clearly that a **savarṇa** wife takes precedence not only in religious acts but also in service to the husband, such as cooking his food, making gifts on his behalf, observing vigils on his behalf and so forth (Medātithi), and that if a husband gets such things done by a wife who is not **savarṇa**, when there is a **savarṇa** wife available, he is to be counted a **caṇḍāla** (outcaste). Lakṣmīdhara sets his face against **a-savarṇa** marriages, particularly for Brāhmaṇas (cf. pp. 38-45) and has condemned **Śüdrā-vivāha**. The Śüdra wife is to be treated as one merely for pleasure (**ratyartham**, p. 40). Wives of lower castes are allowed to Brāhmaṇas only when the **savarṇa** wife is dead or is superseded (p. 44). The question of seniority among wives does not therefore arise for Lakṣmīdhara, and he omits to treat of it.

PARIVEDANA: PRIORITY OF MARRIAGE AMONG BROTHERS  
AND SISTERS

 For the peace of a joint family it is necessary that there should be no unhealthy rivalry between brothers as to who should get married first. The eldest son is held to have a special right to continue the family and to do **pitṛ-kārya.** He has an obligation to marry and continue the line. He may choose not to marry, and prefer to become a **naiṣṭhika** (lifelong student), or an ascetic (**bhikṣu**) ; or he may get absorbed in **yoga** practices and be averse to marriage. He may prolong his studentship beyond the minimum period of study. What are the younger brothers to do, if the elder brother does not marry



while they are inclined to marry? The right of the elder brother is protected by the principle of **parivedana** or sin of supersession. A younger brother, who marries, when an elder is **unmarried,** incurs this sin. He becomes a **parivettā** ; the brother who is thus forestalled becomes a **parivinna** ; the girl who is married becomes a **parivedinī**. All incur the sin. The presiding priest at this marriage and the parents of the girl also incur the sin. The idea underlying the comprehensive condemnation is to compel every one concerned to exercise the utmost circumspection and avoid the offence. Neither indifference nor ignorance will mitigate the guilt. They all go to hell. But if the marriage is performed in spite of the caution it does not become void. The "brothers" in the rule are uterine ' brothers, and must also be of the same caste as the father : for, then only will the right to religious duties arise. Seniority for this rule is not to be noticed among sons by different mothers, or among sons by mothers of different **vārṇas** (p. 107). The apparently contradictory views of smṛtis on the subject are thus reconciled by Lakṣmīdhara. If the elder brother has left his home for study or for earning wealth, and maintains communication with his family, eight to ten years must elapse before the next younger brother can marry, even if the absentee brother remains unmarried. But, if no news comes from the absent brother, an interval of six years is enough to give freedom to the younger brother to marry. An interval of three years suffices, if the absent brother is a debauchee (**kāmāsaktaḥ**), or is absent on the king's business abroad (**proṣite rājasevake)** or is engrossed in agriculture. But the normal period of waiting should be twelve years, and the shorter periods are for a brother who is eager to marry (**atitvaramāṇasya kaniṣṭhasya,** p. 111).



Spiritual advantages flowing from marriage do not accrue to a younger brother who violates the rules and marries before the elder. The elder brother, when he marries after the younger, is also guilty. This rule is to prevent collusion. There can be no valid permission to a younger brother to marry from an elder brother, if he is unmarried and intends to marry later on. The rules apply **mutatis mutandis** to the marriage of sisters. The marriage of two brothers on the same day, or of two sisters is interdicted (**tasmāt saha-vivāho na kāryah,** p. 107) and comes



under the prohibition. The sin is greater in marriage than in kindling the sacred fires, after marriage. It may happen that a younger brother, though married after the elder brother, may kindle the fires first. He is to be held blameless.

 But, the rule does not apply where the elder brother (or sister by analogy) is disqualified : as by madness, crime, leprosy, being sent out of caste, impotence, consumption other chronic and incurable disease, or congenital dumbness, idiocy, blindness or deformity. The age of the waiting brother should also be considered. If he is getting old while waiting, he might transgress the rule with impunity (p. 110). A Brāhmaṇa elder brother engaged in pursuits which make him the equal of a **Śūdra** (like cattle-rearing, trade, handicrafts, menial service, and usury) may be by-passed and the younger brother can then marry as if the elder brother was dead (p. 111).



Medhātithi is of opinion that the periods of waiting should be reckoned not from the date of the elder brother's absence but from that on which the younger brother becomes fit for marriage on the termination of his **brahmacarya** [(**ed. Jha, I, p. 281**)](# "विवाहकालश्च स्वाध्यायविधिनिवृत्तिः।"). The culpability is also laid on the bride (**parivedini)** in order that she might refuse to marry a younger brother when his elder brother is fit to marry but remains a bachelor [(Medhātithi)](# "कन्ययाऽपि तादृशाय दातुं न देयम्।").

THE KINDLING OF THE FIRES (AGNYĀDHĀNAM)

 The performance of enjoined daily and special fire rites is one of the means of discharging part of the triple debt (**rṇatrya**) in which man is born. Competence to perform the rites arises only from marriage. One of the first duties, after the wedding, is to kindle the fire which husband and wife will worship jointly. No sacrifice is possible without the fire. In order that offerings may reach the deities for whom they are intended they must be thrown into the fire with appropriate **mantras** and ritual. Agni (Fire) is the mouth of the gods ; what is put into Agni is as good as put into the god's mouth : **sarve devāscāgnimukhās-smṛtāḥ** (p. 135). The kindling of the fire marks the



beginning of **gārhastya**, and the end of the student's life. The fires are of two kinds : **srauta** and **smārta**. The nuptial fire, kindled during marriage, is the **smārta** fire. The three **srauta** fires, known jointly as **tretā**, are the **Āhavanīya**, the **Gārhapatya** and the **Dakṣināgni**. There are two more fires, named the **Sabhyāgni** ("social" fire), which, according to Medhātithi (III, 185) is maintained for relieving cold in the householder's hall, and the **Laukikāgni** or **Pācanāgni**, the common kitchen fire. **Sabhyāgni** may be described as the fire of the hearth and **Laukikāgni** as the fire of the home. They are lighted without any ceremonial, and have not the sanctity of the other four.

 The ideal for the householder is to have lit all the six fires. If he has lit five, i.e., **tretā**, **gṛhya** and **sabhya**, he is styled **pañcāgnī**and enjoys great honour. He sanctifies a party gathered together for dinner in a **srāddha** by his mere presence at it [(**Pańktipāvana**.)](# "यथा मनुः (३, १८४-१८५)—अग्र्याःसर्वेषु वेदेषु सर्वप्रवचनेषु च। श्रोत्रियान्वयजाश्चैव विज्ञेयाः पंक्तिपावनाः॥ त्रिणाचिकेतः पञ्चाग्निः—॥") The **Gṛhyāgni** has many names : **Vaivāhika** (marriage-born), **āvasathya** (pertaining to the dwelling), **aupāsana** (pertaining to worship) and **aupasada,**^(²)(**Kāṭakagṛhyasūtra**, **XLVII, 1-2)**, which is treated as synonymous with **gṛhyāgni** by **Aparārka** [(p. 490)](# "औपसदो गृह्याग्निः इति अपरार्क्रभाष्ये, (पृ. ४९०)"). It is also usually equated with **śālāgni**, as by [Haradatta'](# "अवाहिताग्नेरपि शालाग्नौ (आश्व. गृ. २, २, ५)—शालाग्निर्नामौपासनः (हरदत्तः)") on Āsavalāyana Gṛhyasūtra, 5.' Maskari **(Gautama-dharmasūtra-Bhāsya)** distinguishes between **sālāgni** and [laukikāgni](# "गौतम. ध. सू, ११, १९ च शालाग्नौ। कुर्यादिति उपरि ऋत्विग्ग्रहणादेतानि पुरोहितः कुर्यात् शालाग्नौ। चशब्दात् लौकिके च। तत्र पूर्वोक्तानि लौकिके, इतराणि शालाग्नौ इति इष्टव्यम्॥ (मस्करिभाष्ये, पृ. १८३)"). One must have for ritual purposes atleast one fire, even if it be the ordinary (**Laukika**) fire. The, wife who has predeceased the **gṛhastha** takes away the fire, with which they were married (**gṛhyāgni**), as she is cremated with it along with the sacrificial vessels.

 **Gṛhasthāsrama** must begin with the creation of the **gṛhyāgni** or **āvasathya**. According to Kātyāyana this fire may be kindled by a student whose studies are over, the moment he has made

up his mind to marry, and an oral promise has been made (**dattā bhavet kanyā vācā,** p. 113) to give a girl in marriage to him. He can light the fire atonce, and perform the rites beginning with **samāvartana** in that fire. The fire itself should then be a continuation of the fire, which he has maintained as a student (**brahmacārin)**, and into which he has thrown as a student his last stick (samit). This fire becomes his marriage fire, when later on he takes a wife. If, in the interval between his raising the fire and his actual marriage, the betrothed girl dies, he can continue with the same fire, after securing another girl for marriage. If, on the death of the promised girl, he is unable to get another to take her place, he should absorb the fire **(ātamasāt-kṛtvā)** by the rite of **ātma-samāropaṇam**, so that it remains latent within him, and await a convenient time for marriage (p. 114). This is the first method of kindling the **āvasathya**. The second and common method is to kindle the fire during the wedding ceremony. It marks the time when a person becomes a **gṛhastha**, who, according to Hārīta (p. 115), is so called because he has assumed charge of the nuptial fire and the duty of discharging the duties enjoined for the **gṛhastha (audvāhika-grahaṇāt, gṛhyavidhānāt ca)**. A third method of installing the **gṛhya** fire is to continue that maintained by one's father, after his death. There is also the provision that one can install a separate **gṛhyāgni** at the time of the partition of inheritance **(dāyākāle)**. Partition need not await the **demise** of the head of the family. It can be made by the father himself in his lifetime, and in some other circumstances which are detailed in the **Vyavahārakāṇḍa** in the **Dāyabhāga** section.

 The **vaivāhikagni**, which can be installed, in any one of the four ways or occasions mentioned above, is the one with which all **gṛhyakarma** (explained by Medhātithi, as all rites enjoined in the [Gṛhyasūtra](# "गृह्यकारोक्तंगृह्यमिति वक्तव्यम् (१ पृ. २३५)")), should be done. The Vedic rites or sacrifices, described in the **Śrautasutrās** have to be done in one or other of the **tretā** i.e., **srauta** fires. These fires need not be installed immediately after the marriage, at the beginning of one's **gṛhastha** life. Their results differ. By performing rites in the **Śrauta** fires, one directly obtains heaven (**svargam āpnoti**), while the rites done in the **smārta** fire are only helps to the



attainment of heaven **(svarga-sādhanam,** p. 125). According to some authorities, one need not install them at all in one's life-time. Among the indicated rites some are obligatory (**nitya)** and some optional, being for the attainment of desired ends **(kāmya)**. For many rites the fruit of performance is specified. Thus, he who longs for heaven is advised to sacrifice on new-moon and full-moon days (**darśa-pūrṇamāsābhyām svarga-kāmo yajeta**), and he who longs for independent sovereignty is advised to perform the **Vājapeya** sacrifice (**svārājya-kāmo vājapeyena yajeta**). In each case there is behind the act a desire for the attainment of an object. Such acts are **kāmya** and therefore optional. Others again are due to occasions (**naimittika**). It is only the fire which required for the **nitya** or obligatory rites that one **must** kindle. The nuptial fire is required for the **nityakarma** of **Agni-hotra** (daily worship of the fire, morning and evening) which is essential (**nitya)**. The householder must have it from the commencement of his life as **gṛhastha**. The Vedic injunction is that "a man who has a son and whose hair is still dark (**jātaputraḥ kṛṣṇakeśaḥ**) should consecrate the three **śrauta** fires." The installation of these was therefore expected to be done in middle age. Śabara holds that there was no particular time for installing the Vedic fires and that it may be done when the pious desire enters one's mind. [(V, 4, 16.)](# "Śabara cites it on Jaiminisūtra, X, 2, 64.") The **Trikāṇḍamaṇḍana** refers to the view of 'some' that the kindling of these fires was optional, and that Baudhāyana held the view [(p. 13)](# "आधानं नित्यमेवेष्टं पितृयज्ञोऽपि तादृशः। कैश्चिन्मीमांसकैः काम्यः पितृयज्ञो निरूपितः॥ आधानस्याऽपि काम्यत्वं बोधायनमतात्भवेत्। सर्वकामार्थमाधानमिति तेन निरुपितम्॥ (१, ६-७)"). Vasiṣṭha (XI, 45-47) is cited by Lakṣmīdhara (p. 117) for the view that a Brāhmaṇa must kindle the three sacred fires, as they are all prescribed (**naiyamikam**). A dictum of Śankha-Likhita is quoted (p. 117) which lays down that the **Brāhmaṇa**, having taken a wife, should make his fire by **agnyādheya** or by the variety **punarādheya**, and perform in it the seven **havir-yajñas.** As the expression, **punar-ādheya** might wrongly suggest that he was to light the fire afresh, Lakşmīdhara



explains that the term refers to a method of fire-kindling (**punarādheyaḥ ādhānaprakāraviśeṣaḥ**). When the **Śrauta** fires are installed, the daily ceremonies too have to be done with them, and not with the **gṛhyāgni.** The daily **aupāsana** or **agnihotra** is enjoined for life, and should not be intermitted. When a man who is not a **pañcāgni** loses his wife, she is cremated with the **gṛhāygni**, and if he is a **pañcagni**, she is cremated with a fire made by attritions (**mathana**). The sacrificial vessels are also burnt with her on the pyre. The nuptial fire (**gṛhyāgni or vaivāhikāgni)** is the one in which the daily **pāka-yajñas** are to be done (p. 116). It should be done along with the wife, not by the Gṛhastha by himself (p. 136). An adulterous wife or a Śūdra wife should not tend the fire (p. 136). The fire is lost to a man who has more than one wife only when he loses the first **savarṇa** wife (p. 138) who is called his equal **(sadṛsī).** In order that the fire may not languish, he is asked to marry without delay (**kṛtadāro avilambitaḥ**). If a polygamous husband finds his first wife, with whom the fire-rites have been done, is adulterous, he need not create another fire, when she is excluded, according to a dictum of Gautama cited in **Chāndogya**-**pariśiṣṭa** (p. 137). The teaching of the smṛtis is that the widower, who does not remarry, is without a fire (**niragniḥ**) and, to that extent, the rule that one should worship the fire throughout life is involuntarily violated. Lakṣmīdhara concurs in the view. But, there is a maxim of unknown authorship (**yāni**) with which he is conversant, that the **Śrauta** fire should not be given up, when a man loses his wife (**vaidikāgnim na tyajet,** p. 138). It also lays down firstly, that when a first wife is alive, cremating the second wife with the **vaitāna** fire is sinful (literally 'equal to drinking **surā**)', and secondly that he who gives up his **Agnihotra** when the second wife (too) dies is to be known as one who had given up the Veda (**brahmojjham tam vijānīyāt**). It seems to sanction a widower's doing the fire rites, without a wife, on the **Śrauta** fire. Laksmidhara rejects the opinion, on the grounds that firstly the authenticity of the dicta it embodies doubtful, **(sandigdhamūlāni)**, and secondly that they appear to relate, from the context in which they appear, to refer to the deaths of a wife of a lower caste (**asavarṇa)** or a second wife only (p. 139).



THE DAILY RITES OF THE HOUSEHOLDER: AGNIHOTRA

In Chapter VI Lakṣmīdhara deals with the rites which a householder must or is competent to perform. Of the daily rites dealt with, the most important is the adoration of the fire. The student performs his fire worship by the rite of **samidādhāna.** The average householder, who is unable to perform the more elaborate rite of the **Agnihotra**, performs daily an **upāsanā** or worship of the fire by a simple rite, which is known as **Aupāsana**, morning and evening, after the **sandhyā** offerings and **japa**. Lakṣmīdhara describes only the more elaborate **Agnihotra,** though there are allusions to the less elaborate **Aupāsana** in his work. For example, the essential features of the shorter worship are described in a quotation from **Paithīnasi** (p. 114) viz., the throwing of the samit (fire stick) into the fire, morning and evening, the offerings being to Sūrya, Prajāpati and Anumati in the morning and to Agni, Prajāpati and Anumati in the evening worship. The rite is done in the **Vaivāhikāgni** (nuptial fire) which has been kindled at marriage. It is in this fire that Manu enjoins the **gṛhya** rites to be done (p. 116).

 The **Agnihotra**, the first of the enjoined rites, is to be done daily, after the installation of the fires (**agnyādheya**). It should be done twice daily in the evening and in the morning. Manu (IV, 25) gives the option to do it, either before or after the **sandhyā** ; according to Medhātithi the option given in Manu's dictum is merely to do it at the end of the night, i.c., before sunrise, or at the beginning of the day, i.e., after sunrise (**Tatroditahominām aharādau, anuditahominām niśānte,** I, p. 339**)**. Härīta extols the **Agnihotra** in terms of hyperbole. It transcends all Dharma, **tapas** (austerity), **śreyas** (distinction), **dāna** (gifts), **damaḥ** (discipline of the self), **yaśas** (fame), **siddhi** (fulfilment), **gatiḥ** (way-out), **sthānam** (position), and **vrata** (vows). The Supreme Being, whom men adore, is immanent in the **Agnihotra.** as fire is hidden in fuel. The Universal Soul, who is lauded in the Vedas, is resplendant in **Agnihotra**. Such exaggerated praise is the conventional way of laying emphasis on the duty of performing the **Agnihotra**. It is not merely the worship of material fire or of invisible divinities to whom offerings are made through the fire : the fire is itself the Supreme Being. Hence,



the person who has been purified (**pūta**) by the daily performance of **Agnihotra**, and who leads a self-restrained life, attains union with the Supreme Being (**sūkṣmāt sūkṣmam, i.e., Para-Brahma**). What appears a mere mechanical rite is thus raised to the plane of a self-less search for union with God. Do not worship any other god but Agni (**Agnimevopāsīta nāṇvadaivatam**) warns **Paiṭhīnasi** on this account (p. 125). In resounding verse, Hārīta sings again the praise of the Fire-god and of sacrifices, which are made through five **yajñas** (pp. 153-156). "Viṣṇu, the Sacrifice and Agni are regarded by the wise as one and the same ; so do they identify Agni with Rudra and Death (**Kāla**)." "Agni is our father, mother, brother, protector, sustainer, the bestower of son, wife, wealth and the dispeller of misfortune. The gods attained their being by worshipping Agni, the Universe obtained immortality in the same way, and the sages, who performed austerities, attained the world of Brahma through Agni. Accordingly, the heroic person, (**dhīraḥ**), who has understood the scriptures (**śuśruvān**), and who is of righteous conduct, will reach the worlds that the gods and sages attained, by devoutly installing the fires and nourishing them appropriately." (p. 156). This is why **Agnihotra** must be done all through life.

 Not only is **Agnihotra** prescribed as a life-long **satra**, in effect longer than the longest **satra**, but it must not be intermitted or discontinued. If a **gṛhastha** has to leave his home on business **(pravasan kāryavān vipro,** p. 158**)** he must arrange for the fire being duly attended to by his wife and a **ṛtvik**. He should not stay away from the fire without business (**mṛṣā na pravaset,** p. 158). The sanctity of the rite will be affected not merely by association of 'impure' persons with the **gṛhastha** like a Śūdra wife, but by performing it with materials obtained from donations given by 'impure' persons. The **dravya** (money or material) obtained from a **támasic** source makes the **yajña tāmasic, rājasic**, when given by **rājasa** persons ; and **sātvic**, when help comes from a **sātvic** source. The character of the priest (**ṛtvik**), who helps the householder in going through the rite, is also reflected in the nature of the **yajña** and its fruits (p. 159). The help received from gamblers, or thieves is 'black wealth ;' it is the worst form. Money secured for **Agnihotra** from the fruits of usury, agriculture, trade, customs, crafts or in return



sacrificial rites, like the **Agnihotra,** are enjoined not for the sake only of those who perform them, but for the sake of every living being, as the continuance of all life depends on the maintenance of the cycle, through their performance,



It may not be possible for every one to do the **Agnihotra.** The householder, who lives by gleaning ears of corn, cannot perform it ordinarily. He is not held culpable if he either fails to perform the rite, or is obliged to drop it after beginning it by want of means. 'All pledges to perform certain acts are conditional on the possession of the necessary means and [capacity](# "सर्वे स्वस्वक्रियाशक्तिमात्रेणैवाधिकारिणः। (१, ६२)").' A vow taken after entering the Gṛhastha stage to perform daily Agnihotra may be broken through incapacity. The **Trikāṇda-maṇḍana** (I. 55) states the position: "If, after making a resolution or vow, to do certain things, as long as life lasts, one finds that his capacity to do them is lost, the duty (**adhikāra**) to do so lapses with the loss of power. This is the view of [**S'alikanātha.**](# "यावज्जीवादिसङ्कल्पकारिणः शक्तिलोपने। आधिकारस्तदन्तः स्यादिति शालीकनाथधीः॥ (१, ५५ )")"The imprecations against those who neglect **Agnihotra** refer only to those who have the capacity and still are negligent.

RITES OF THE HOUSEHOLDER: PERIODICAL RITES

 There are twenty-one occasional rites, divided into three "sevens." The three are: **Pā**

**ka-yajñas, Havir-yajñas, and Somasamsthās.**

A. THE SEVEN PĀKAYAJÑAS

 Pāka means "small." Pākayajñas are comparatively minor sacrifices, as their class name signifies. The seven in this group are : the **Aṣṭaka**, the **Pārvaṇa,** and the monthly (**māsika**) **Śrāddhas**, the **Śrāvaṇī**, the **Āgrahāyaṇī,** the **Caitrī**and the  
**Āsvayujī**.



The **Aṣṭaka** is a **srāddha** performed three times a year, on the eighth day of the dark fortnight in Mārgaśīrṣa and the two



months succeeding. A fourth **aṣṭaka** is also mentioned in Phālguna. The **śrāddha** to be celebrated on the two days following the middle **aṣṭaka** is known as the **Anvaṣṭaka.** **Māsika srāddhas** are done on all new-moon days. The new-moon **tarpaṇa** (**tila-tarpaṇa**) is the common substitute for the monthly **srāddha**, usually known as **darśasrāddha**.



**Pārvaṇa** or **Pārvaṇa-sthālīpāka** must start soon after marriage, after the bride is brought to her new home. It is an offering of cooked food to the fire, after the oblation is sprinkled over with melted butter (**ājya**). Of the deities concerned Agni is the chief. The offering is then served out to a Brāhmaṇa, who is given also a **dakṣiṇā.** From that time on, the Gṛhastha and his wife must repeat the rite every fortnight, on new-moon and full-moon days. It is begun on a full-moon day.

 **Caitrī**is the old **sūla-gava** (" spit ox ") rite, in which an ox, branded with the mark of a trident (**śūla**) was sacrificed in Autumn or Spring. The commentators of Gautama, who refers to the rite (VIII, 16), identify the ancient **Śūlagava** with the **[Caitrī](# "चैत्रीशब्देन शूलगवः (मस्करिभाष्ये,५, १६)").** In its later forms, the Gṛhastha and his wife offer cooked food mixed with **ājya,** through the fire, to a number of deities, then give the remnants to **Brāhmaṇas** with appropriate **dakṣinā**, and share what remains with their relations. It is now done in the month of Caitra.

 **Āgrahāyaṇī** is a sacrifice following the harvest, the offerings consisting of the first fruits. The Gṛhastha and his family can consume the new harvest only afer this is done. It an annual rite. The Gṛhyasūtras describe a simpler form of it than that dealt with in the Śrautasūtras.

 **Śravaṇi** is known as **sarpabali**, because it is done on the full-moon of Śravaṇa for the propitiation of serpents.

 **Āśvayuji** is so called because it is done in the month of Aśvayuja (**Āśvina**), on the full-moon day, in honour of the Aśvins and cows. Cooked rice, mixed with **ājya**, is offered to Paśupati (śiva) and a mixture of curds and **ājya** is offered to the cows. Amulets, to ward off misfortune, are then tied to the arms of the men and women of the family.



B. HAVIR-YAJÑAS



The seven **Havir-yajñas** are the **Agnyādheya, Agnihotra, Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa, Āgrayaṇam, Ayanayajñam, Cāturmāsyāni, and Sautrāmaṇi** (p. 119). The **Ayana-yajña** is also known as **Nirūḍha-paśubandha.**

**** Havis consists of ten articles, to be thrown into the fire, as offerings. These are milk, curds, **yavāgu**, clarified butter, boiled rice, husked rice, soma, flesh, sesame oil, and [water](# "पयो दधि यवागूश्चसर्पिरोदनतण्डुलाः। सोमो मांसं तथा तैलमापस्तानि दशैव तु॥ (पृ. २४, नारायणकृत आश्वलायनगृह्यसूत्रवृत्तिः) तथैव अनाविलायाम् (प्र. ३५.)"). Where others are either not available or are not specified for use, clarified butter is to be [used](# " यथा गोभिलगृह्यो-आज्यंहव्यमनादेशे जुहोतिषु विधीयते॥ (१, ११३) आज्यस्वरूपं तु, तस्य प्रतिनिधयश्चत्रिकाण्डमण्डने (पृ. २, ४२-४५) सूचिताः। घृतार्थे गोघृतं ग्राह्यं तदभावे तु माहिषम्। आजं वा तदलाभे तु साक्षातैलं ग्रहीष्यते॥ (१, ४२)."). Of these, the **Agnyādheya** is a more elaborate rite than the one with which the fire of the newly married **gṛhastha** is kindled. It also means the establishment of more than one fire. The **tretā** (viz., the **Āhavanīya, Dakṣināgni** and **Gārhapatya** fires) have to be kindled, and consecrated one after the other, and then the **Āvasathya** (**Gṛhya**) and **Sabhya** fires have to be made either with the domestic fire, or with fire produced by attrition, or with fire taken from the newly made **Āhavanīya**. When all the five fires have been duly installed, the sacrificer (**yajamāna**) offers a **purṇāhuti** (i.e., an oblation with a full **sruk** or ladle), gives **daksiṇā**, and worships the fires. If the **yajamāna** is a **Kṣatriya** a game of dice follows. The **dakṣiṇā** depends upon the wealth of the sacrificer. Strict continence should be observed by the sacrificer for atleast three days and nights after the installation of the fires, when he and his wife must also sleep on the ground.

 If ill-luck pursues the **pañcāgnika,** who has established the five fires, after he has done so, he may install and consecrate a fresh set of fires, with a simpler ritual. This is known a **Punar-ādheya.**

****

The **S'rauta Agnihotra** is the older and more elaborate form of the fire-worship, which the householder has to follow from the



day on which he lights the **Agnyādheya**. He has to do it with the **vaitāna** fire twice daily, morning and evening (p. 123). If the householder, who has established the **tretāgni** is obliged to leave the fire for a brief interval, he should get a person, who is an expert in attending to the triple fire to attend to his duties (p. 126). Only certain types of **Kṣatriyas** (e.g. those who has performed a **somayāga**) can do the daily **Agnihotra** in the **Śrauta** form.



The **Darśa-Paurṇamāsa** sacrifice must be done by an **Agnihotrin** all his life, or atleast for thirty years, or so long as physical capacity [lasts](# "ताभ्यां यावज्जीवं यजेत। त्रिंशतं वा वर्षाणि। जीर्णो वा विरमेत्॥ (आप. श्रौ. ३, १४, ११-१३)॥ अथ त्रिकाण्डमण्डने यथा (१, ५६)—यावज्जीवादि सङ्कल्पादूर्द्ध्वं चेच्छक्तिलोपनम्। तथाऽपि नाधिकारस्य हानि र्वार्तिकदर्शनात्॥ [असामर्थ्येऽपि यथा कथञ्चित् नित्यं कर्तव्यमेव]॥") (Ap. III. 14, II-13). It is an **işți** or rite requiring four priests and the sacrificer. It has to be begun on the full-moon following the **Agnyādheya,** and finished for the first time in two days. The new-moon following, it should be done again, and followed by the offering of **piṇḍas** to the manes (**pitṛ**). This continuation-rite is often known as **Piṇḍa-pitr-yajña**. But, Jaimini (IV, 4,19-21), regards this ceremony as an independent rite, and not a continuation of the new-moon sacrifice. The manes have to be given **piṇḍa**, or atleast water, on new-moon days, by every **gṛhastha**, even if he has not established the Vedic fires. **Pitṛyajña** is also enjoined as a daily rite, and included in the five **Mahāyajñas**.

 **Āgrayaṇi** **iṣṭi** is done after the new harvest, on a new-moon or full-moon day with the ritual of the **darsa iṣṭi** (new-moon **iṣṭi**). The **āhitāgni** does it with the Vedic fires, and by a simpler ritual ; one who has not established the **tretā**, does it in the **gṛhya** fire.

 **Ayana-yajña** is an animal sacrifice also known as **Paśubandha** or **Nirūḍha Paśubandha**. It is a half-yearly sacrifice at the two solstices (ayana). The **āhitāgni** is to do it twice a year, all through his life, or atleast once a year. The rite takes two days, one for the preparation and the other for the sacrifice itself. Both the **Āgrayaṇa** and the animal sacrifice **(Paśubandha)** are



prescribed by Manu, and the **gṛhastha** can eat new grain or meat only after he has performed these two [respectively](# "नानिष्ट्वा नवसस्येष्ट्या पशुना चाग्निमान् द्विजः। नवान्नमद्यान्मांसं वा दीर्धमायुर्जिजीविषुः॥(मनु,४,२७)").'

 The **Cāturmāsya** consists of three **iṣṭis** performed at intervals of four months from each other, beginning with the **Vaiśvadevaiṣṭi** on the full-moon of Phãlguna or Caitra. The next **iṣṭi** in the series is done on the full-moon of Āṣāḍha or Āśvina, and is known as **Varuṇaprghāsa**. The third **iṣṭi** is named the **Sāka-medha** (joint-sacrifice) and it is done on the full-moon of **Kārtika** or **Mārgaśīrṣa.** The three constitute together the **Cāturmāsya,** and they inaugurate spring, the rainy season and autumn. The person who performs the **Vaiśvadeva** gets progeny, he who does the next is released from the "noose of Varuṇa" and the last "establishes" the [performer](# "Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, I, 6, 8.").

 Though the **Sautrāmaṇī—**is included in the **havir-yajñas,** it is also an animal sacrifice. Its best known feature is that **surā**(fermented liquor) is offered to the fires and the lees, i.e., the remnants of the offering, were drunk by a Brāhmaṇa hired for the purpose.^(³) It is named after Indra (**Su-trāman**, the good protector), who was cured of the effects of drunkenness by it. It is performed to overcome an enemy. A son is never free of the debt he owes his mother unless he does the **Sautrāmaṇī** sacrifice. The implication of this declaration is merely that the way of redemption of the debt to a mother is so difficult that one never ceases to be in debt to his mother. The sacrifice lasts four days and the Aśvins, Sarasvatīand Indra are offered **surā**and animal victims.

C. SOMA-SAMSTHĀḤ

 The seven Soma sacrifices are the **Agniṣṭoma**, the **Atyagniṣṭoma**, the **Ukthya**, the **Ṣoḍaśin**, the **Atirātra** and the **Aptoryāma**. Soma sacrifices are classified according to the time they take to complete as **ekāda**, (one-day), **ahīna** (above one day and under twelve days) and **sattra** (above twelve days).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3 "In this sacrifice a Brāhmṇa had to be hired for drinking the dregs of sura offered in it" (Kane, op. cit., P. 793)



 The **Agniṣṭoma** is part of the **Jyotiṣṭoma**, which lasts for five days, and with which it is usually identified. Jaimini holds that the performance of **Jyotiṣṭoma** is compulsory for all **dvijas** (VI, 2, 31). Agni is the god of the **Agniṣṭoma**. It is done in **vasanta** (spring) every year. It has to be performed after one has done the **Darśa-paurṇamāsa** sacrifices (ib. V, 4, 26). The sacrificer and his wife undergo consecration (**dīkṣā**) and the former is afterwards known as **dīkṣita**. He is held to be re-born in the **dīkṣā**, and to have become purified by it. The fees for this and other soma sacrifices are heavy. One may give his daughter in marriage in the Daiva form to the **Adhvaryu.** The **Atyagniṣṭoma** is a modification of the **Agniṣṭoma**. The **Ukthya** is a sacrifice with fifteen **stotras** and **śastras**, the **Śoḍaśin** with sixteen of these, the **Atirātra** with twenty-nine of each and the **Aptoryāma,** an expansion of the preceding with four more stotras and śastras.

 Gautama counts these twenty-one periodical rites among the forty **samskāras**. As a **samskāra** is obligatory, his meaning is that all the twenty-one sacrifices are obligatory, and not [optional](# "Gautama, names the twenty-one in VIII, 16-18, at the end of his enumeration of the Samskāras, and winds up with VIII, 19—इत्येते चत्वारिंशत्संस्काराः।"). While Lakṣmīdhara cites in the **Gṛhasthakāṇḍa** authorities enjoining the due performance of the twenty-one **yajñas** as well as the **mahāyajñas**, like the **Rājasūya, Vājapeya,** **Aśvamedha, Pauṇḍarīka** and **Gosava** (p. 119), he does not cite there this dictum of Gautama bringing the twenty-one **yajñas** under **samskāras**. But, he has done so in the **Brahmacārikāṇḍa.** Following Hārīta, he lays down there that samskāras are either **Brāhma** (Vedic), like **garbhādāna**, etc. or **Daiva** (pertaining to deities) like the **pākayajña**, **haviryajña** and **somayajña**. The distinction implies a difference of emphasis on their relative force, the **Brāhma** being superior to the **Daiva.**

**** Obviously, an injunction that **every** one should do all these will be unworkable. Most householders will not have the means to do many of the rites. Others will not have the capacity. Dharma adjusts itself to means as well as capacity. It paints the ideal while requiring only the practicable. Mechanical performance of a duty is worse than ignoring the obligation. Zeal, freedom from covetousness and economic capacity are



needed for the discharge of some of the enjoined duties of the Gṛhastha. This is why Vasiṣṭha (p. 132) is cited to show that one lacking them should not attempt the consecration of the **tretā**by the rite of **Agnyādheya**, and that only he who has more than a sufficiency (alam) for the performance of a **somā** sacrifice should perform it. Manu is even more emphatic. One who endeavours to secure his happiness after death (by performing such sacrifices, for instance) by spending in the effort to attain his end what he should devote to the support of those dependent on him, loses his good both in this life and in the [hereafter](# "भृत्यानामुपरोधेन यत्करोत्यौर्द्ध्वदेहिकम्। तद्भबत्यसुरवोदर्कंजीवतश्च मृतस्य च॥ (११, १०)"). Before a **gṛhastha** attempts to do a **soma** sacrifice he must have in **reserve** an amount equal to atleast three years' expenditure. He who with little wealth performs the soma sacrifice loses its fruit (p. 133). Few Gṛhasthas were rich enough to perform the enjoined **yajñas**. The principle that the character of the source from which a sacrificer is helped will color the sacrifice and affect its result, restricted the area of help to the needy **gṛhastha.** Once a **yajña** is begun, it must be done correctly, and the prescribed fees and gifts (**dakṣiṇā** and **dāna**) must on no account be reduced. Manu utters a solemn warning of the grave disaster that awaits one who begins a yajna and is forced to reduce the **dakṣiṇā** (p. 134). Thus, one who consecrates the triple fire by the rite of **Agnyādheya** and is unable to give the priest the customary present of a horse fails to become an Āhitāgni (one who has consecrated the fires, p. 134). If a poor king performs with limited resources a sacrifice, without having wealth enough to tide over a year of state expenditure, the kingdom suffers and he loses the benefit of the sacrifice (p. 135).



The practical difficulties of performing the twenty-one **yajñas** are thus clearly visualized by the authorities. If one is enjoined to do a thing by Dharmaśāstra it must always be understood as subject to this condition—"if he has the capacity." This is the reason why some **smṛtis** omit the **yajñas** in question from their catalogue of **samskāras**. Even the simplest rite (**gṛhyāgni-upāsanam**) needs two persons to do it, besides milk, clarified butter, grain, fuel, etc. The number of priests usually



required for a **yajña** is four, and in many cases the number is greater, rising to sixteen, all of whom have to be remunerated with fees and gifts. The sacrificer (**hotā**), his wife and the **ṛtviks** have to wear special clothes, sometimes of silk, white sometimes and sometimes colored red. The clothes should be new, **i.e**., not bleached (**ahatavāsas**) (p. 144). A hide of the black antelope (**Kṛṣṇājina**) must be kept ready for the sacrificer to sit on (p. 151). The sacrificial victims should be gathered. The fees (**dakṣiṇā**) must be kept ready, for "a lost **dakṣiṇā** is a lost sacrifice" (**dakṣiṇāhata eve hataḥ,** p. 152). The priests must be men of learning, purity and character, and carefully selected for these qualities (**kula-śīla-vṛtta-sampannān ṛtvijo vṛṇuyāt,** p. 152). Men with such qualifications will not be easy to find, They will have to be well remunerated for their assistance. Even for the simplest rites the resources of one who has begun it may be found to be inadequate after it is commenced. He is then empowered to beg for help of men of the first three castes, and even to take unasked what is absolutely necessary for the **yajña** from them [(p. 163)](# "Trikāṇḍamaṇdana (I, 108-111) explains the purpose of injunctions to sacrifice 'somehow'. निर्धनोऽधनसाध्येषु नित्येष्वधिकृतो यदि। चौर्यादन्यैः कुमार्गेरपीष्टयर्थं घनमर्जयेत्॥ सूर्यग्रहे कुरुक्षेत्रे मेषीकृष्णाजिनादिकम्। चाण्डालात् प्रतिगृह्यापि यजेतावश्यकैःमखैः॥ ये शूद्रादधिगम्यार्थं अग्निहोत्रमुपासते। इत्यादि निन्दाबाक्यानि काम्यहोमविवक्षया॥ etc.").

 But, even in getting the wherewithal for discharging his pious obligations, he is under several inhibitions. He should use for the **yajñas** only wealth of the proper 'complexion.' It should not have **rājasic** or **tāmasic** origin (p. 159). The **yajña** done with tainted wealth (**asad-dravyapraṇīta yajña)** is lost (p. 161). Not only is acceptance of help for **yajña** from the last **vārṇa** condemned, but acting as **ṛtvik** to a Śūdra is denounced in even stronger terms (p. 172). Acceptance even from a king is conditional on his being a righteous ruler, (**dhārmike sati rājani, p. 162**). Acceptance even from a Brāhmaṇa, who is affluent, has restrictions. Thus, if the donor has only a **gṛhyāgni**, the minimum degree of affluence, which entitles him to help a Brāhmaṇa in need of assistance to do his sacrificial duties, is that he should have atleast a hundred cows, but if he is one who is maintaining



the five fires (**āhitāgni**), he must have atleast a thousand cows before he is competent to help. The higher the religious duty of one, like the **āhitāgni**, the more wealth does he himself need to fulfil his own religious obligations. The restriction is to prevent applications for help to an **āhitāgni**, because he **seems** affluent. [(Medhātithi, XI, 13)](# "See inf. p. 163. “एवं विधाभ्यां (अनाहिताग्निः शतगुः) आहर्तव्यमितिश्लोकार्थः।” (मेधातिथिः २, पृ. ३७३)"). Seeking help of one who is doing a soma-yāga is forbidden (**ayajvā, i.e. somayāgarahitah,** p. 163) because he will need all his wealth for his own **soma-yāga** (**sahasragor-asomāt, p. 164**). If the wealth of another man is taken unasked by the Gṛhastha for barely discharging his obligation in **yajña**, and he is taken up before the king on a charge of theft, he should own up his action, and the king must treat him (in the circumstances) with consideration (**rajñā prṣṭaḥ tena bhartavyaḥ**). The implication underlying the rules, which thus relax or harden in certain cases the rights of property in favor of those who feel that they cannot do their appointed duties, unless they get resources therefor somehow or other, is that the obligation to discharge his religious duties lies not only on every individual but upon every other person in society, who is more fortunately placed. This is so because the performance of **yajñas** benefits not only the person who does them but all society, since rains depend on **yajñas**, and food on [rain.)](# "भगवद्गीता (३, १४)—अन्नाद्भवन्ति भूतानि पर्जन्यादन्नसंभवः। यज्ञाद्भवति पर्जन्यो यज्ञः कर्मसमुद्भवः॥")

 The difficulties are not merely economic. The rigor of the regimen imposed on the sacrificer and his wife has also to be considered in relation to possible lack of zeal, disinclination to face hardship and even lack of health to stand the strain. The rules of life are described in chapter VII. The sacrificer has to undergo a partial fast both on the day preceding a sacrifice and on the day of the **yajña** itself. He must lie on both nights on the bare ground. So must his wife. Cots should not be used. He must avoid conjugal intercourse. The partial fast **(aupavasta)** is described inter alia as avoidance of black gram **(māṣa)**, meat and **sarpis** (milk-products p. 142). He must control his temper. He must utter no falsehood. He must not



enter into needless talk with people. He must remain clean, (śuci), restrained, alert (**dakṣa**) and unsensual during the ceremony (p. 142). In **srāddhas** especially is purity enjoined, as the manes insist on it (**pitaro ha vai sucikāmā,** p. 143). He must not speak to any woman other than his wife (p. 149). He must not miss the proper time for the rites. He should not take food from others (**parānna**) on the day of the **yajña** (p. 150). He should not eat newly harvested grain (p. 151). In prolonged sacrifices, he must cohabit with his wife only on specified days. (p. 151). He must not take honey. He must not laugh (p. 151). He should not answer the calls of nature in day-time (p. 151).



Such descriptions of the discipline of the consecrated sacrificer's life during a **yajña** are intended to keep out those who could not face it. Failure is worse than omission.

 In his **Dānakāṇḍa** and **Tīrtha-kāṇḍa, Lakṣmīdhara** has contrasted the rigors of **yajñas** and their unavailability to the ordinary man and woman, as contrasted with gifts and pilgrimage, which bring almost the same fruits as **yajñas**. But, the reference there is to acts which have the attainment of a desired object (**kāmya**). The normal duties of a householder are **niṣkāmya,** i.e. to be done without any expectation of, or for an anticipated, benefit. They must be discharged, irrespective of any adventitious spiritual gain that may accrue from doing so.

DUTY AND OCCUPATION

 Occupation is determined by one's duty (Dharma), which again is determined by one's **varṇa**. There are Grhasthas in every **varṇa**. Studentship and the last two **āśramas** do not exist for the last **varṇa** (Śūdra). What is laid down as proper for normal times may not be feasible in times of difficulty (**āpad**). **Varṇāśrama-dharma** qualifies occupation by caste and order. What is open to one **varṇa** and **āśrama** is not often open to another, even normally. Social balance and peace require that persons should not have the freedom to take up any pursuit at will. Competition must, in normal circumstances, be restrained and kept within the limits of **varṇa** and **āśrama** Dharma. The limits which may not be passed even in times or circumstances that are exceptional, must be clearly indicated in a scheme of



social planning, whose first postulate is that the highest end for every one is secured only when he submits to the plan.

 Lakṣmīdhara devotes six chapters to the exposition of the duties and occupations (**karma-dharma-vṛttayaḥ**) of the **Brāhmaṇa** householder (pp. 167-250). He then devotes a chapter each to the duties of householders of the Kṣatriya, Vaiśya and **Śūdra varṇas (ch. XIV and XVI).**

THE PAÑCA-MAHĀYAJÑA (“FIVE SACRIFICES ")

 Lakṣmīdhara prefaces his treatment of the duties of the first **varṇa,** in chapter VIII, by a quotation from Manu, which introduces the subject of the occupations of Brāhmaṇas in the fourth book of **Manusmṛti,** by alluding to the treatment of the **pañcayajña** as its logical predecessor. But, Lakṣmīdhara himself has omitted a description of these in **Gṛhasthakāṇḍa**. The five sacrifices are the Vaiśvadeva, Bhūta-yajña, Pitṛ-yajña, Manuṣyayajña and Brahma-yajña. Vaiśvadera is also styled **Devayajña.** Mādhavacārya (I, i, p. 389) lumps three of them under Vaiśadeva.^(¹) The five sacrifices are enjoined for everyday. **Vaiśvadeva** is worship of the gods. **Manuṣya-yajña** is the entertainment of guests (**atithi**) i.e., the rite of hospitality. **Brahma-yajña** is **svādhyāya**, the study of the Veda, Brahma signifying the Veda. **Pitṛ-yajña** is adoration of the manes of ancestors. **Bhūta-yajña**is offerings to **bhūtas** or elementals.

 The offerings of **Vaiśvadeva** are thrown into the household fire (laukikāgni). The propitiation (**tarpaṇa**) of the manes (**pitaraḥ**) is by offerings of water. The placation of the elementals (bhūta) is by bali offerings placed on the ground. The guest is **Vaiśvānara** (Agni), and what is put into his mouth is an offering to the fire-god [(p. 129)](# "The Fire is angered when a guest starves. cf. Kaṭhopanıṣad, I, 7-8. वैश्वानरः प्रविशत्यतिथि र्ब्राह्मणो गृहान्। तस्येताꣳ शान्तिं कुर्वन्ति हर बैबस्वतोदकम्॥ आशाप्रतीक्षे संगतꣳसूनृतां चेष्टापूर्ते पुत्रपशुꣳश्च सर्वान्। एतद्वृङ्क्ते पुरुषस्याल्पमेधसो यस्यानश्नन्वसति ब्राह्मणो गृहे॥"). **Svādhyāya** is explained by Manu as teaching (**adhyapāna**), which includes **adhyayana** (study)

**1** पराशरमाधवीये (ed. Islampurkar ) I,1 p. 389—"तो एते देवयज्ञ-भूतयज्ञ-पितृयज्ञस्तयोऽपि वैश्वदेवशब्देनोच्यते।"



(III, 70). **Gṛhastha** life is said to cause slaughter in five ways, and a householder is a living slaughter-house (sūnā). The five places of slaughter (pañca-sūnā) are the hearth (cullī), the grinding stone (**peṣaṇī**), household articles like the broom **upasharaḥ**), mortar with pestle (**kaṇḍani**) and the water pot (**uda-kumbha**). The five sacrifices are expiatory rites for the five sūnas of family [life](# "पञ्चसूना गृहस्थस्य चुल्लीपेषण्युपस्करः।  कण्डनी चोदकुम्भश्च वध्यते यस्तु वाहयन्॥  तासां क्रमेण सर्वासां निष्कृत्यर्थं महर्षिभिः।  पञ्चकृप्ता महायज्ञाः  प्रत्यहं गृहमेधिनाम्॥ (मनु, ३, ६५-६९.)"). By the **pañca-yajña** one makes offerings to gods, guests, dependants, manes and himself [(III, 72)](# "देवताऽतिथिमृत्यानां पितॄणामात्मनश्च यः। न निर्वपति पञ्चानामुच्छ्वसन्न स जीवति॥ (३,७२).") "They also term these five sacrifices, **ahuta, huta, prahuta, Brāhmya-huta and prāsita ( III, 73 )** ; study and teaching (**japa**) is **ahuta** (not poured into the fire) ; Vaiśvadeva offering is **huta** (put into the fire) ; the offering to Bhūtas is **pra-huta**, a **homa**, though not with fire ; the feeding of the guest is **Brāhmyehuta** ; and water libation to pitṛs is [prāśita](# "अहुतं च हुतं चैव तथा प्रहुतमेव च। ब्राह्म्यं हुतं प्राशितं च पञ्चयज्ञान्प्रचक्षते॥ जपोऽहुतो हुतो होमः प्रहुतो भौतिको बलिः। ब्राह्म्यं हुतं द्विजाग्र्यार्चा प्राशितं पितृतर्पणम्॥ मनु, (३, ७३-७४).") ." These terms are used in a citation on p. 119 **infra**, showing that Lakṣmīdhara had the subject in mind, though he did not develope it in this **kāṇḍa.** The object of the Vaiśvadeva was to get rain, as it was supposed to reach the Sun. [(III, 76).](# "अग्नौ प्रास्ताहुतिः सम्यगादित्यमुपतिष्टते। आदित्याज्जायते वृष्ठि र्वृष्टेरन्नं ततः प्रजाः॥ (३, ७६).")

 The deities of the Vaiśvadeva are named differently in different smṛtis. Gautama names five ; Manu adds five [more](# "अग्नेस्सोमस्य चैवादौ तयोश्चैव समस्तयोः। विश्वेभ्यश्चैव देवेभ्यो धन्वन्तरय एव च॥ कुह्नैचैवानुमत्यै च प्रजापतय एव च। सह द्यावापृथिव्योश्च तथा स्विष्टकृतेऽन्ततः॥ इति मनुः (३, ८५.४६ )॥' अग्नावग्निर्धन्वन्तरिर्विश्वेदेवा प्रजापतिः स्विष्टकृदिति होमाः'॥ (गौतमीये, ५, ११)॥' वासुदेवाय सङ्कर्षणाय प्रद्युम्नायानिस्द्धाय पुरुषाय सत्याय अच्युताय वासुदेवाय। अथाऽग्नये सोमाय मित्राय बरुणाय इन्द्राय इन्द्रामिभ्यां विश्वेभ्यो देवेभ्यो प्रजापतये अनुमत्यैधन्वन्तरये वास्तोष्पतये अग्नये स्विष्टकृते च' इति विष्णुस्मृतौ (६७, २-३)॥") and



**Viṣṇusmṛti** names eighteen (LXVII 1-3). It has to be done once a day atleast, and the offerings (which consist of part of the food cooked for his own meal) are thrown by the **gṛhastha** into either the **gṛhyāgni** or the cooking fire (**laukikāgni**). The remnants of the fire-offerings are to be given to animals, and even dogs and caṇḍāḷas, according to Āpastamba.^(¹) The injunction he **pañcayajña** to give water to manes, bali to elementals, offerings to gods, food to guests, and remnants of **Vaiśvadeva** to dogs, birds and outcastes, involves two implications, viz. permeation of all being, both in this life and beyond it, and of every living thing by the Universal Spirit, and the duty of those to whom hearths and homes have been given to recognize in the common bond a debt to be discharged by daily offerings, which commemorate the obligation.

DUTIES OF THE FIRST VARṆA

 Six duties are imposed on the Brāhmaṇa, viz. teaching, study, sacrificing, helping others to perform sacrifices, acceptance of gifts (**pratigraha**) and making gifts. Three of these, namely **yājana,** (helping a sacrificer), **adhyāpana** (teaching) and acceptance of gifts from un-sinful persons (**viśuddha pratigraha**) are really means of livelihood. Gifts may be accepted only in circumstances which do not entail a consequential penance, insists Lakṣmīdhara (p. 168). Āpastamba allows wealth in the shape of receipts from children (**dāyādyam**), gleaning ears of corn which have fallen on the threshing floor **(siloñca)**, and what is common property, like wild rice **(nīvāra).** The conditions of **pratigraha** are laid down elaborately in the **Dānakāṇḍa**. The circumstances in which the teacher may receive gifts from pupils are detailed in **Brahmacārikāṇḍa**. These are not therefore repeated in **Gṛhasthakanda.** In sacrifices a Brāhmaṇa is not allowed to stipulate for fees. One who does so **(pāṇaka)** is condemned. A **dakṣiṇā** is invariably coupled with every religious rite, and the Brāhmaṇas present receive it. It is not tainted wealth. Even a **dāna** must be accompanied by

आपस्तम्बधर्मसूत्रे यथा ( २, ३, ५ )—"सर्वान् वैश्वदेवाभागिनः
कुर्वीताश्चचण्डालेभ्यः॥"



a **dakṣiṇā.** For officiating at sacrifices, a **śrotriya** receives fees in gold and in kind, according to schedules. A teacher cannot insist on fees from a pupil. Normally, therefore, except for windfalls, like sacrificial fees or gifts, the lot of a Brāhmaṇa Gṛhastha is to be poor. But such poverty is not only foreseen but praised.

 Brāhmaṇa householders are of two classes : **sālīna** and **yāyāvara.** The etymologies given for both words attempt simply to describe the characteristics of each class (p. 169). The **sālīna** has a house or houses and is relatively well-off. He may be one who is content with keeping only the **gṛhyāgni (gṛhya-sālinaḥ**) or he may maintain the three **Srauta** fires also (**ātretā-śālīnaḥ**). The **gṛhyaśālīna** may again be one who is **asampanna-vṛttiḥ, i.e.,** one who devotes himself solely to the guardianship of the fires, or **sampanna-vṛttiḥ, i.e**., one who makes a living by **yājana** (officiating in sacrifices) and **kṛṣi** (agriculture). Gleaning grains of rice (**uñchaśila**) is known as **ṛtam** (ordained) ; what is obtained without solicitation from the good is **amṛtam e.g.**, gifts from pupils ; **mṛtam** is alms ; **pramṛtam** is cultivation of land ; **satyānṛtam** is trade ; and **svavṛtti** is the characteristic descriptive epithet for work as a servant, who is ordered about like a dog. Each foregoing occupation is deemed better than those following (p. 170). A Brāhmaṇa will not be master of his own time if he accepts service and cannot attend to his obligatory religious duties. This is why service **(svavṛitti)** is declared the last resort to a Brāhmaṇa. Cultivation, trade and service are only **āpad-vṛtti** (occupations in times of difficulty) and each of these may be resorted to only if those preceding it are unavailable. The drift of the injunctions is to keep the Brāhmaṇa out of economic occupations. Even in following these he is enjoined to do so with the **minimum** of trouble to others, and to restrict his earnings to what is needed for his **bare** subsistence and religious duties (p. 170). Even alms must be collected only in handfuls, and from several persons, so as not to put one or two charitable persons to undue strain. Only food grains may be obtained by begging, and "the begging of cows, gold and other things could not be regarded as sanctioned by the 'handful' **(prasṛta**)" says [(**Medhātithi**)](# "प्रसृतिमात्रं भिक्षेति तेन गोहिरण्यादिभिक्षणं न प्रसृतशब्देनाभ्यनुज्ञायते। प्रतिग्रहाद्यर्था याच्या इति। "). But even such emergency



occupations as cultivation, trade and lending out money are permissible only if done through others (p. 171.) The main thing to aim at is freedom from **lolupam**, the itching to amass.

 The ideas are implemented in the classifications of **Brāhmaṇa Gṛhasthas** into **śāliña**, the comparatively well-off person, who usually has a home, cattle and servants, and the **yāyāvara,** who has no fixed habitation but goes from place to place, every ten days or so, and maintains himself solely by picking up grain, that has fallen on the ground, when transported from the threshing floor, or gleaning ears of standing corn (p. 173). His life is more abstemious than even than that of a poor **sālīna.** Five places from which alone he can gather grain are indicated by Hārīta (p. 174). He lives in a hut roofed with leaves **(parṇaśākhā)**, on the outskirts of the village. He should never have grain for more than six months, and this period itself is allowed because no gleaning is possible in the rains. Eight ways of gleaning grain are indicated by Baudhāyana for the **yāyāvara** (p. 178). A ninth, viz., getting cooked food (**siddhānnam**) is allowed only if he is too old and too feeble to pursue the other methods ; but, in such a case, as food cooked by others cannot be offered to the sacred fires, he must absorb the fires within himself by the rite of **samāropaṇa**, before resorting to this practice, as a last resource (p. 182). A tenth method, which a **gṛhaṣtha** living in the woods (**vānya**) can alone practise, is picking up forest simples and wild grain.



The strict **śālīna** has little wealth. He may have a brick-built grain-store (**kusūla)**, which can hold the grain needed for his subsistence and his family's for three years, or a mud-built receptacle which can hold only six months' supply, or have only enough grain for three days' use or no grain for the morrow. Among them, each succeeding type is held as **superior** to those preceding. A hand-to-mouth existence is thus held up as the ideal for the **Brāhmaṇā gṛhastha**. The injunctions, coupled with the rules enjoining the performance of daily rites by even the poorest **gṛhastha**, which will involve the use of enough food grain, milk, clarified butter etc., would be impracticable if responsibility was not simultaneously thrown on the community to maintain the **gṛhastha**. Medhātithi shrewdly observes that gleaning grain is possible only once every six months during



harvest-time, and therefore holds that even those who are asked to subsist by such means, must have supplementary earnings in the way of gifts from pupils, whom they taught, and **dakṣiṇā** in sacrifices, as well as gifts from the pious and affluent men of the first three **varnas** [(**Manu-bhāṣya, IV, 9**)](# "कथं पुनः शिलोम्छावृत्या जीवनं संभवति? यावता शरद्ग्रीष्मयोरेव क्षेत्रे खले वा शिलपुलाकपातसंभवः। अथोच्यते। 'ग्रैष्मेभ्यो ग्रैष्म्याणि शारदानि शारदेभ्योऽर्जयिष्यति' इति षाण्मासिकवृत्तिरेव स्यात्॥ (मेधातिथि,१, पृ.३३२)"). The **Mahābhārata** declares that vast wealth is a calamity to a [Brāhmaṇa](# "अनर्थो ब्राह्मणस्यैष यद्वित्तनिवयो महान्॥ (अनुशासनपर्व, ६१, १९ )."). As thirst grows with drinking, the acquisitive instinct is strengthened by accumulation of wealth, and leads to spiritual degradation. This is the idea underlying the prohibition of excessive capital in the hands of the Brāhmaṇa, who has to set an example to others. In order to prevent the Brāhmaṇa from succumbing to the temptation to lose himself in gainful occupations, and make them out to be forced on him (**āpad-dharma**), thereby deserting his duties, the king as well as well-to-do persons of other **varṇas** are enjoined to make suitable provision by grants of lands as well as gifts to pious Brāhmaṇas, so that they may perform those religious rites and sacrifices, and follow their duty of teaching, which are held to be necessary for the material and spiritual welfare of society as much as of those who perform them. The endowment of villages of śrotriyas, of different gotras, so as to enable them to marry within the village and continue these pious duties, is specially commended in **Dharmaśāstra**, and is evidenced both in literature (which reflects practice) and in inscriptions. There are two records of Candradeva, the grandfather of Govindacandra, for instance, which describe the grant of a village to five-hundred named **śrotriyas** of different [gotras](# "These are the Candravati plates, dated Samvat 1150 and 1156 ("). As a **Gṛhastha** of uncommon affluence, who seemed to violate the injunction to live the simple life of poverty, Lakṣmīdhara mentions, in obvious defence of his own life, the endowments that he had made (out of his own wealth) of numerous villages in which **śrotriyas** lived happily with their [families](# "'दत्तानेकपुरद्विजोत्तमवधूसङ्गीतनादोत्सवो गार्हस्थ्यं वदति' इति मङ्गलश्लोके ।").



That such gifts were common is inferrable from the injunction not to touch a sacrificial post (**yūpa**), as it [pollutes](# "Viṣṇusmṛti, 22, 69 ; Vasiṣṭha, 4, 38, यथा—यूप-चिति-श्मशान-रजस्वला-सूति-काशुचींश्च स्पृष्ट्वा सशिरस्कभ्युपेयादप इत्यप इति॥") ; for, unless such contacts were of ordinary experience, there would be no need to utter the warning. Kālidāsa reflects the ideal, and probably also the practice of his time, when he describes Dilīpa's journey to the hermitage of Vasiṣṭḥa, passing on the way villages of **śrotriyas**, marked by sacrificial posts, which he had himself given to them as gifts, and receiving from them their "irresistible" [benedictions](# " रघुवंशे, १, ४४, यथा—ग्रामेष्वात्मविसृष्टेषु यूपचिह्नेषु यज्वनाम्। अमोषाः प्रतिगृह्णन्तावर्घ्यानुपदमाशिषः॥ अपि च ६ ३८, यथा—संङ्ग्रामनिविर्ष्टसहस्रबाहुः अष्टादशद्वीपनिखात्यूपः। अनन्यसाधारणराजशब्दो बभूव योगी किल कार्तवीर्यः॥"). The drying up of the sources of support to the first **varṇa**, after the Muslim invasions and conquest, made it almost impossible for a **gṛhastha-śrotriya** to live his enjoined life, and serve society by his religious and educational activities.

BRĀHMAṆA OCCUPATIONS IN TIMES OF DISTRESS

(ĀPAD-DHARMA)

** Āpad** (distress) arises when one is unable to find a living adequate for his requirements. Thus, if a Brāhmaṇa has parents and dependents whom he cannot maintain by following the three lawful occupations, he may resort to those that are allowed in distress (p. 187). Adequacy should be construed along with a life of restraint and contentment (p. 183). The general principle, which is enunciated by Manu (p. 1184), is that it is better to follow one's own prescribed Dharma, even if it is not the best, rather than follow what is best in the Dharma of another **varṇa**. One must exhaust even inferior modes of living open to his **varṇa** before trying the best of the next **varṇa**. He must not ordinarily skip over the Dharma of an intervening **varṇa**, but he may take up the occupation of a Vaiśya, in preference to following for a living the profession of arms, which is pre-eminently indicated for the Kṣatriya. Even in fun, says Gautama (p. 187), a Brāhmaṇa should not handle arms. Against this extreme



statement, which is made only for emphasizing the interdiction of a military life for the first **varṇa**, we have the other dictum that for the defence of Brāhmaṇas and cows, as well as to prevent the mixture of castes (**varṇasamkara**), both the Brāhmaṇa and the Vaiśya may take up arms. The other general rule for following **āpad-dharma** is indicated by **Yājñavalkya :** "When he has got over the distress (**nistīrya āpadam**) he should purify himself for the (involuntary) lapse from it, and resume his old duty" (p. 188). Accepting gifts, though permitted, is definitely the most inferior of the six ways of finding a living. It must be tried to its limits, even to the extent of accepting gifts from non-Brāhmaṇas and from persons who are not good men, before the occupation of the next **varṇa** is undertaken. In extremity, one may teach and sacrifice for non-Brāhmaṇas. Wealth saved in times of distress by following one of the tolerated modes of living must be given up, when the distress ceases (p. 189). A Brāhmaṇa who has taken up the occupation of another **varṇa,** and continues to follow it with delight, even after the emergency which forced its adoption is over, is the worst of his caste (**kāṇḍapṛṣṭha, p. 189**). To follow the professions of the cultivator, the money-lender and the trader, after the distress is past, is sinful for a Brāhmaṇa (p. 189). But, following the pursuit of a Śüdra is never allowed to the Brāhmaṇa.

AGRICULTURE

 The practice of agriculture is interdicted for **Brāhmaṇas,** owing to the destruction of animal life it entails, though it is enjoined for the Vaiśya, and may be adopted as an **āpadvṛtti.** The plough is a slaughter-house (**sūnam hi lāṅgalam, p. 191**). Accordingly, if a Brāhmaṇa is compelled to take to cultivation as a distress occupation, he should follow it only so far as its gains are absolutely needed. He should also observe rules of kindness towards the plough cattle, not over-burdening them or treating them cruelly, nor using any but sturdy oxen, using as many as necessary and not fewer, thereby increasing the strain on those yoked to the plough or for draught purposes, not castrating oxen, abstaining from using them in winter (**śiśire**), and feeding and watering them properly. If one does all this, the harvest



may be likened to a **yajña (khaḷa-yajña, p. 194)**, which purifies those who have taken part in cultivation. The reconciliation of the two extremes of absolute prohibition of agricultural work to the Brāhmaṇa and allowing it (following the Vedic permission, utilized in Vasiṣtha's dicta, p. 192), is found in the rules of humane treatment of the cattle used in agricultural operations. In the days of Lakṣmīdhara, as today, there were probably many members of the first **varṇa** who themselves ploughed their lands. One of the means of expiation is to pay one-sixth of the produce of the land as tax to the king (though a **Brāhmaṇa** is ordinarily exempt from taxes), one-twentieth to the gods and one-thirtieth to **Brāhmaṇas** (p. 185).

TRADE (VĀṆIJYA)

 Trade, cattle-rearing and money-lending are the occupations of the Vaiśya. He has freedom, within the limits of inhibitions based on religion or on humanity, to trade in any article. But, not so the Brāhmaṇa, who is allowed to follow trade only as a distress occupation. He is, however, prohibited from **selling** (or purchasing) a number of stated articles, the enumeration of which takes up several pages. He cannot get behind the prohibition by **bartering** one article for another (**nimāta, niyama**). Essences (**rasāḥ)** may be exchanged, however, for essences, but not for salt; cooked food for uncooked grain, **tila** (sesamum) for similar oilseeds; catttle for one another; learning for learning and men for men (pp. 209-210).

 The last two, viz., knowledge and human beings, are significant, as the sale of learning i.e., teaching for a stipulated fee, is prohibited as well as traffic in human beings. What is allowed (by Vaṣisṭha) is barter of slaves for slaves, and of the teaching of one branch of knowledge to a person in return for being taught another by that person. A distinction is thus made between sale for money and barter, the latter being the less sinful. The sale of cooked food offends the injunction to show hospitality as well as compassion to the hungry. Even as a distress occupation a Brāhmaṇa cannot become a hotel-keeper. The prohibition of the sale of yarn dyed red is of the same type as the prohibition of food which is blood-red in color. The sale of poison is



forbidden as it may lead to crime. The sale of arms is barred because it may lead to the assumption of arms later on, though it is specially deprecated for even the distressed **vipra**. The prohibition of dye-stuffs like **lākṣā** (lac), which is of animal origin, and **nīlī** (indigo) is because of their associations. Silk and woollen goods are similarly prohibited for sale. Meat, liquor, hides and certain metals are also forbidden for sale by Brāhmaṇas. Honey and bees-wax involve cruelty to bees, and their sale by Brāhmaṇas is prohibited. The sale of Soma is prohibited though it has to be purchased by the sacrificer, from a Śūdra or from a Brāhmaṇa of a gotra which is named **"despised"** (**kutsa**). Sprouted seed cannot be sold by him. The sale of dry cows and of young cows is barred to him because a dry cow is apt to be illtreated and the separation of the calf from its mother is cruel. Cows similarly may be given as gifts but not sold by a Brāhmaṇa (p. 206). The prohibition of the sale of women is only a condemnation of the **Āsura** form of marriage (p. 206 and p. 204, **yaḥ paṇamo duhitaram dadāti**). Association of ideas suggests to Lakṣmīdhara the sale of the Veda (accepting a stipulated wage for teaching it) and the sale of services in a sacrifice (**yājana**) and in a discussion (**vāda**). One should not be a mercenary controversialist (p. 206). The acceptance of prescribed **dakṣiṇā**in religious function like a **yajña** or a sacrifice is however no sale. Gifts, after solicitation and question, (pp. 205-206) are brought by analogy, as well as association of ideas, under prohibited sales in **āpad-vṛtti,** as one may be tempted to resort to them for livelihood.

CATTLE REARING (PĀŚUPĀLYAM)

 The second of the Vaiśya occupations comes below trade for the Brāhmaṇa in distress. Its lower position is due to conscious or unconsicious negligence of the considerate treatment due to cows, which are briefly described (p. 213). A cow should not be milked till the calf has drunk its fill. Cows which are very young or old or ill should be treated with compassion. He who illtreats a cow goes to the **Avīcī**hell.



MONEY LENDING (KUSĪDAM)

 Lending money for interest is looked upon as a degrading occupation. It is forbidden both for Brāhmaṇas and for Kṣatriyas. The culpability is increased by extorting heavy interest as well as compound interest (**cakravṛddhi**). Weighed in a balance against the greatest sinners, the usurer (**vārddhuṣika**) out-weighs them all (p. 216). Interest may be taken only from the lowest **varṇa** (p. 217). The rates of interest which smṛtis allow, and which are usually given in **Vyavahārakāṇḍas**, are briefly specified. (pp. 217-221). Bṛhaspati's defence of moneylending as an excellent occupation, because it is unaffected by seasonal vicissitudes or by fear of the king, is cited as an extenuation of its adoption as an **āpad-vṛtti**, because he asserts that it is among the means of livelihood sanctioned by the sages (**ṛṣibhiḥ parikīrtita**).

MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONS IN DISTRESS

 A long quotation from Dakṣa (p. 230) on the paramount duty of supporting parents, wife, children, dependents and preceptor (**ācārya**) as well as of protecting suppliants and poor relations (**kṣīṇaḥ bandhujanaḥ**), is relevant for re-inforcing the duty on the well-to-do **Gṛhastha**, and for making the **distressed Gṛhastha** realize the obligation as lying upon him also to the extent of his power, when he undertakes occupations permitted only when those prescribed are unavailable to him.



But even the greatest distress will not justify the following of professions or pursuits which are manifestly objectionable because they are immoral e.g., conniving for money at the adultery of a wife, or gambling, or engaging oneself for arguing against one's own convictions for money (**vivādavṛtti**), or finding a living from fomenting quarrels, or bribery and extortion (**rājapauruṣyam**), robbery and theft, and mercenary service for criminal purposes (p. 227). Other pursuits are condemned as not upto the level of sanctity held up for the **śrotriya.** Among them are those of the physician, astrologer, carrier, oilmonger, toddy-seller. Extortion of fees from sons on the ground of being their guru during **upanayana,** vending lac, flesh, mead



**(madhu)** metals and poison, and living like a Śūdra are offences. The lumping together of learned professions with toddy-sale is merely for emphasis. The general rule is that one should not take up professions reserved for higher **varṇas** as distress occupations **(na-adhikām)**, or are low, despicable and destructive **(anarthakarī, p. 228).**

**** With the above reservations, such of the ten occupations as are specified by Manu as lawful (p. 222) may be followed in distress. Crafts **(śilpa)**, teaching of subjects other than the Veda for remuneration, and service under the king are among pursuits thus allowed. Begging is allowed for one who is travelling, or is ill, or poverty-stricken, or has been driven away from his family (p. 224). Though following the pursuits of a Śūdra and of a Kṣatriya is interdicted, even that is allowable when one stands otherwise of losing his life **(prāṇa-samśaye,** p. 224**)**. A starving Brāhmaṇa is guiltless when he takes grain without the owner's permission or takes it from a non-Brāhamaṇa (p. 226). It will not then be an **asat-pratigraha** (forbidden acceptance). Nor will he be guilty if he takes a meal (without permission) from even those who do not neglect their duties, who are maintainers of the fires **(āhitāgni)** and drinkers of Soma, if he has missed six meals already. (Gautama, inf. p. 226). Even necessity must bow to law (Dharma). The principle is that a **Brāhmaṇa**, who has starved for three days, may appropriate another's property, for his morning meal on the fourth day, two meals a day having been prescribed in the texts. Medhātithi (who gives this explanation of **Manusmṛti, XI, 16**), cites from a smṛti the following [rule](# "स्मृत्यन्तरे—हीनादादेयमादौ स्यात्तदलाभे समादपि। असंभवे त्वाददीत विशिष्ठादपि धार्मिकात्॥ (२, पृ. ३७३).") : "At first the starving man many appropriate food from a person of lower status than himself; then if no such is available, from a man of equal status; and, in the event of this also being unavailable, even from a person of superior righteousness." He adds the explanation that what is taken may be not only for food but for the essential requisites of his daily sacrifices. The principle should not be literally acted upon by a Kṣatriya; for he must in no circumstances appropriate the property of a Brāhmaṇa, but take it from criminals and those who neglect



their duties (p. 226). Even in dire need, one should not do anything which will prevent a spiritual superior from discharging his duties. The appropriation is not to be secret, but must be owned up, when questioned by the king (p. 226).

ACCEPTANCE OF GIFTS (PRATIGRAHA)

 Three modes of subsistence which are allowed only to the Brāhmaṇa are teaching the Veda **(adhyāpanam)**, conducting a sacrifice for another **(yājanam)** and acceptance of a gift **(pratigraha)**, each of these being inferior to the three normal and proper occupations of Vedic study, sacrifice **(yajanam)** and bestowal of gifts **(dānam).** **Pratigraha** is placed lowest among the allowed **vṛttis** (occupation). Lakṣmīdhara, who is almost the first **nibandhakāra** to devote a special section to Dāna, (the fifth in the **Kṛtya-Kalpataru**) regards **pratigraha** as an **āpad-vṛtti, i.e.,** a distress ocupation. He also treats of it after **kṛṣi, vāṇijya** and**kusīda**, which reflects the low estimation he held **pratigraha** in. As the acceptance of gifts (apart from secular presents) is prohibited to members of the other **varṇas**, and at the same time **dāna** is **enjoined** as a means of salvation for every one, it may be asked : "How is a valid gift, that will be accompanied by unseen benefits (**adṣṛṭa-phala**) possible, if the varṇa, whose members are alone allowed to receive it, are warned that they should not readily accept it?" The point of reconciliation is found thus. Gifts may be accepted if they conform to all the enjoined conditions as to the occasions when they may be given, the objects that may be given, the qualifications possessed by the donors, and the spirit of devout belief in which the **dāna** is made. (**Dānakāṇḍa**, Introduction, pp. 76-85.) As every gift is held to carry with it a load of demerit (**a-puṇya**), any defect in the prescribed rules of gifts will be serious to the **pratigrahī**(receiver of the gift). This is why Manu (IV, 187, p. 248 infra) has uttered this warning : "Without a correct knowledge of the rules prescribed by the sacred laws for the acceptance of gifts, a wise man should not accept anything, even if he is pining with hunger at the time." The fool who accepts a gift sinks into hell (Manu, IV, 191), and according to **Yājñavalkya** (p. 247) he who does not possess learning and austerity should avoid acceptance of



gifts, as thereby he leads the giver and himself to hell (I, 202). Accordingly, one who is competent to receive gifts by virtue of his **varṇa**, learning and austerity (**pratigraha-samartha**), is still well-advised not to accept them (p. 249). **Vyāsa** utters a warning against acquiring a taste for receiving gifts (**pratigraha-ruciḥ**) as it will surely lead to disaster (**ānarthyam, p. 249**).He who solicits gifts (**yācanaka**) is much worse; he is like athief, and all living beings dread him (p. 249). To accept a gift is allowable indeed, and the desire for wealth so got (**vittehā**) may be permissible, but the absence of any such desire (anīhā) is far better for a person, just as not getting into mud is better than washing off the mud after getting soiled (p. 250).

 Lakṣmīdhara has dealt with **pratigraha** briefly and allusively in **Dānakāṇḍa**. This is because the logical place for dealing with it is in discussing the duties and sources of income of Brāhmaṇas, who are alone competent to receive **dāna**. He has devoted several pages to the topic (pp. 231-250) in the **Gṛhasthakāṇḍa**, and has omitted it in the later **Dānakāṇḍa.** Unlike Mitramiśra and several other digest writers, Lakṣmīdhara rarely repeats what he has discussed in one section of his digest in other sections. He aims at consistency and compactness.



The general rule (**stithi**) in regard to **pratigraha** is thus stated by Manu (IV, 33; inf. p. 231) : "Even if he be pining from hunger he should ask for wealth only of the rajā or those for whom he has officiated as priest in sacrifices or his pupils, and from no others." Medhātithi, (I, p. 345) explains the dictum and says that **rājan** here means any wealthy person, and not necessarily the king, as elsewhere [Manu](# "न राज्ञः प्रतिगृह्णीयादराजन्यप्रसूदितः। (४, ४४).") has prohibited acceptance of gifts from kings who are not Kṣatriyas, and permitted (p. 232) requests being made to kings, by Brāhmaṇas who are wasting away (sīdadbhiḥ, X, 113). He also adds that one for whom the applicant has formerly officiated in a sacrifice may be appealed to for help. It is further contended by Medhātithi that the applicant need not be in distress and the help be sought as an **āpadvṛtti.** Lakṣmīdhara on the other hand holds that only as a distress-resort can such an application be made for help, and he cites the dictum at the beginning of his



discussion of the acceptance of gifts (**pratigraha)** viewed as an **āpadvṛtti.**

**** Starvation is no justification for indiscriminate solicitation of help. The sophist (**hetuka**), the blasphemer **(pāṣaṇḍi)** and he who only gives in order to advertise his virtues **(dambhī)** are barred as potential donors (p. 231). Manu roundly declares that acceptance of gifts from butchers is vile, and that the king is equal to ten thousand butchers (**daśa-sūnā-sahasrāṇi samo nṛpaḥ,** X, 86; inf. p. 234). Nārada, on the other hand (p. 232), defends pratigraha from kings on the ground that they have an abundance of wealth from which help may be given without their feeling the pinch, and that they cannot be deemed impure, since by their decision one who is impure is accepted as pure **(aśucir vacanādyasya śucir bhavati pūruṣaḥ, Nāradasmṛti, p. 222).** The conflicting statements of Hārīta, (p. 236) Manu, and Yama (p. 235) on the one side, and of Nārada on the other, are reconcilable if applications to kings are allowed only as **āpaduṛtti** and the ruler is righteous and a Kṣatriya. As **Mahāsāndhivigrahika,** Lakṣmīdhara must have drafted many grants, and advised his king to make many donations in expiation or for acquiring merit. He must be presumed to have seen the point of reconciliation in the apparently opposed dicta which he has quoted. A distinction is made between solicitation for oneself and for others; the latter is allowable even from a Śūdra (p. 236). If a Brāhmaṇa gets food for himself for six months from a Śūdra he becomes a Śūdra. A distinction is made also between acceptance of cooked and uncooked grain, the latter being acceptable on all occasions (p. 237).



The purpose for which a gift is used, or sought, determines its acceptability. One can, according to Bṛhaspati (p. 238), take a gift even from a bad man if it is intended to be given to a good person. The sin of acceptance is washed away by giving away what has been received (Yama, p. 239). While one can accept gifts freely (and vicariously) for gods, guests, and teachers, he can do so for himself, only if he is in dire need, **(Yājñavalkya p. 239),**

****

**Pratigraha** (acceptance) applies equally to what is solicited, i.e., begged, for, (bhikṣa) and to a gift proper (**dāna**). In both there is **adṛsta-phala** for the giver and accrual responsibility to



the recipient, if he does not belong, as regards bhikṣā of kṛtānnam (begging for cooked food), to the first and last āsrama. The Gṛhastha has no privileged mendicancy. In both, the donor gives up his ownership in the thing given, and it accrues to the recipient only after he has formally accepted it in due form (see Dānakāṇḍa, Introduction, pp. 76-85). In Dānakāṇḍa, Lakṣmīdhara looks at gifts from a different angle from that it is viewed at in **Gṛhasthakāṇḍa**. In the former it is looked at from the giver's standpoint, as enabling him to acquire merit (**puṇya**). In the latter it is viewed from the standpoint of the recipient, as forced on him by his dire need, and taken only because he has exhausted all other resources. In the former the aim is to show how the merit of a gift may be maximized to the donor; in the latter how the sin (**a-puṇya**) accruing from acceptance may be minimized to the recipient. This is why we find one and the same type of gift lauded in one and condemned in the other section of the same digest, e.g., the gift of the cow at the moment of calving (**ubhayatomukhīgo-dāna**). In **Dānakāṇḍa** (pp. 166-176) this **dāna** is praised to the skies. It is held up to admiration as releasing from perdition twenty-one generations of ancestors and descendants (op. cit., p. 166). In **Gṛhasthakāṇḍa (p. 247)** a passage from the **Ādityapurāṇa** is quoted to warn one against accepting such a cow : a thousand nooses of Varuna, 'fiery and cruel, bind the recipient of the **ubhatomukhī**for a full thousand years.' This is why the emphasis in **Dānakāṇḍa** is on the high quality (virtue, austerity, learning etc.) of the donee, while in **Gṛhasthakāṇḍa** the stress is always on the virtues of the donor, and on his **varṇa, sthāna** (position), affluence and needs (as determining the existence or otherwise of a surplus from which a gift can be made) as well as on the nature of the object given. Certain things can be accepted from any one (e.g. assurance of freedom from fear, **abhaya**). Certain things can neither be given nor accepted e.g., human beings, poison, weapons, and intoxicating liquor (p. 247). Neither alms nor gifts may be accepted from physcians, huntsmen, prostitutes, eunuchs, rogues (p. 246) and outcastes (p. 245). Land may be accepted even from a wicked king (p. 242). A long list of things which may be accepted from any person is furnished in the smṛtis and is summarized by Lakṣmīdhara (infra pp. 240-245).



 The aim of the rules is clear. On the first **varṇa** rests the**entire** duty of the education and spiritual uplift of the **community**. On the manner in which its members discharge their personal duties, and help others in doing their's, depends social welfare and solidarity. The king gives **visible** protection and the **Brāhmaṇa**spiritual and unseen protection. They are both **dhṛta**-**vrata**,**dedicated** for social service and protection. The position of both is lauded, that of the **Brāhmaṇa** even more than that of the king, because he has not, like the ruler, visible compensation in affluence and comfort for his abstemious life, self-denial and uncontracted services. A **varṇa**, whose best members are believed to possess supernatural power, should be saved from sinking into the position of a priesthood, which preys on society, exploits its piety and credulity, and exacts an endless stream of tributes and benefactions from it, irrespective of the personal qualities of its members. The stringent prohibition of wealth and affluence to the Brähmaņa, as a **normal** feature of his life, the restriction of his activities to spiritual and educational purposes, the abolition of the wish as well as the means to promiscuous mendicancy, the compulsion to live in society and to serve it without stipulation for reward, the exclusion from gainful occupations and from politics and war and the denial of kingship to its members, have all only this aim.

OCCUPATIONS OF KṢATRIYA AND VAIS'YA

 Three of the functions of the first **varṇa** are with-held from the second, viz. teaching, sacrificing for others and receiving gifts, while the other three remain. It is so with the **Vaiśya**also. The special duties of the Kṣatriya are bearing arms, using them to protect others, and, if he is a king, to rule the country righteously (**kṣitim dharmeṇa pālayan, p. 252**). The name**Kṣatriya** is derived from **kṣatāt trāṇam,** protection from attack.**Vyavahāra**, settling disputes between litigants, and **anusāsanam,**maintaining members of all orders and castes in their proper places, are also named as duties of the **Kṣatriya**; but they are obviously possible only for the **crowned Kṣatriya**, i.e., the king. What is implied is that these duties devolve on a ruler, not merely because he is the head of the state, but because he is a



**Kṣatriya**. A king who lays down his office may escape his duty as king but as a **Kṣatriya** he still has it. A voluntary abdication, which will relieve a king of regal duties, will not absolve him of his liability to discharge them, if he happens to be a **Kṣatriya**also, unless he makes due provision for proper adjudication of suits and for enforcement of the rules of **varṇāsrama-dharma**. One cannot run away from his personal duty. A **Kṣatriya's**Curriculum of Studies includes not only the Veda but also the art of war (**dhanur-veda**). He becomes a **snātaka**, i.e., completes his **brahmacarya**, prior to entering the second order of the householder, only when his military training is finished (p. 253). He fulfils his educational duty only partially by the study of the Vedas and observance of the vows of celibacy (**vedavrataikadesi** ; p. 253). Not to run away from battle is the Kṣatriya's duty and  
so is it to lead an independent life (**īsvara-bhāvaḥ** or **a-paravasatvam**). If a Kṣatriya is not a king, he must live by serving a king as a soldier (Gautama, p. 254). Devala makes the duties of the Kṣatriya include worship of the gods and service to the **Brāhmaṇas**, as well as protection of Vaiśyas and **S'ūdras**. A **Kṣatriya** is forbidden to beg (**a-yācanam, p. 255**). The injunction to the **Brāhmaṇa** to follow the occupation of the **Kṣatriya**, when in distress, is nothing but permitting him to take up a soldier's life ([Gautama](# "तदलाभे क्षत्रवृत्रिः (गौतम., ७, ६).")).' The seizure of the throne by **Puṣyamitra**, the Mauryan general, was neither due to distress, as he was already a soldier, nor because there was then any danger to **Brāhmaṇas** and cows and imminence of miscegenation (**varṇasamkara**), which are the only contingencies in which it is permitted to the Brāhmaṇa to take up arms ([Gautama VII, 25](# "प्राणसंशये ब्राह्मणोऽपि शस्त्रमाददीत ( गौतम, ८, १५).")). By slaying the master to whom he was bound to be loyal he had incurred the guilt of ingratitude (**kṛtaghnatā**). By seizing the throne, he had taken up a duty which is not open to a **Brāhmaṇa**. In every way he had outraged **Brāhmaṇa**sentiment. This is why **Bāṇa**, who lived centuries later, refers to him with scathing contempt as an un-Aryan [(**anāryaḥ**)](# " प्रज्ञादुर्बलं च बलदर्शनव्यपदेशदर्शिताशेषसैन्यः सेनानीः अनार्यो मौर्यं बृहद्रथंपिपेव पुष्पमित्रः स्वामिनम् ॥ हर्षचरित, ed. Fuehrer. p. २६९).").



 Like the other two twice-born (**dvija**) castes, the **Vaiśya**has also the triple function of Vedic study, sacrifice and making gifts. Like the **Kṣatriya** he is denied the other three **Brāhmaṇa**occupations of sacrificing for others, accepting gifts and teaching the Veda. He is also interdicted from following the avocation of a soldier, even as an **āpad**-**vṛtti**, because the general rule is that even in emergencies no one can take up an occupation marked for a caste higher than his own (**na tveva jyāsīm vṛttim abhimanyeta karhicit, p. 257**). His function is to breed cattle (**yoni-poṣaṇam**) or tend them for wages (**vetanena paśurakṣaṇam**), as parts of **Vārtā**, the comprehensive statement of his occupation. This includes agriculture and trade also. Devala marks for the Vaiśya the professions of carrier, dancer, vocal and instrumental musician, and wrestler (p. 255). Money- lending is his speciality, but if he exceeds the maximum rate allowed by smṛtis, he becomes an usurer. In regard to this rate the smṛtis differ. Gautama (XII, 20) and Vasistha (II, 511)**Yājñavalkya** **(II, 37), Nārada** and Manu (VIII, 140) prescribe 15 per cent a year as the maximum for what the commentators explain as 'secured' debts. **Baudhāyana's** rate (I, 10, 22) is only twelve per cent for the same debt (p. 255), and this is indicated by **Lakṣmidhara**, who quotes the 15% rules also earlier (pp. 217-220) as the proper rate for the **Vaiśya**. The earlier indications are made in treating of the distress occupation of the **Brāhmaṇa,** while the later are given under the normaal duties of the Vaiśya. It may be inferred that, in **Lakṣmīdhara's** view, during an emergency the **Brāhmaṇa** can take up the profession of money-lending, with certain restrictions such as avoiding the levy of compound interest (**cakravṛddhi, p. 220**), and in doing so not go beyond the rate of interest prescribed as proper for loans made by the **Vaiśya**. The **Brāhmaṇa** takes to trade, when following as an emergency occupation those of the **Vaiśya**, but is still restrained from selling a number of articles. These are named, following Manu (X, 85-90), on pp. 199-200. They include all **rasas**(savoury substances), cooked food, sesamum, stones, salt, animals, human beings, every article dyed red, any article made up of hemp silk or wool, fruits, roots, medicinal herbs, water, poisons, flesh, soma, perfumery, milk, curds, butter, oil, honey,



bee's wax, oil, **sugar** and **kusa** (holy grass), wild animals, fanged animals, birds, wine, indigo, lac and one-hoofed animals. The implication is that the **Vaiśya** (and the **Kṣatriya**) can sell them, since only the Brāhmaṇa, when obliged to follow the**Vaiśya-vṛtti**, is warned off these. It is how **Medhātithi (X, 95)** has understood [it](# "जीबेदेतेन राजन्यः सर्वेणाप्यनयंगतः ॥ १०, ९५ ॥ एतेन सर्वेणापि - प्रति- षिद्धपण्यप्रतिप्रसवोऽयं राजन्यस्य । न किंचित्तस्याविक्रयं वैश्यवत् ॥ (मेघातिथिः, २,पृ-३५८)"). But, in treating of the normal occupations of the Vaisya, Lakṣmīdhara (who must have been conversant with the above view of **Medhātithi**), cites the**Mahābhārata** and the **Kālikāpurāṇa** (p. 258), in support of the doctrine that a **Vaiśya** should never sell (**na vikrayet**) the following articles: salt, wine, mead, sesamum, curds, clarified butter, milk, bees' wax, lac, hides, indigo, poisons, weapons, flesh, asafoetida, food mixed with molasses, or oil-cake, and the fruits of vrnta and other plants, swords, arrows, water, idols (**devān**), various acid fluids like vinegar (**śuktān vividhān**), substances derived from rocks (rock-salt, silājit etc.,) and Nepalese blankets (kutapa, p. 204). The inference is that in his view trading in such articles, though done by **Vais'yas,**was improper, and their special interdiction for **Brāhmaṇas**(or **Kṣatriyas**) obliged to follow a **Vaiśya's** occupations, is intended to emphasize the rejection for all the twice-born, in-cluding the **Vaiśya**.

 Since the articles in question are needed by the community, including all **varṇas**, they must be sold. The members of the last **varṇa**, or persons outside the four castes must trade in them. As a matter of fact, dairy produce is sold by **S'ūdras**, hides by **antyajas**, and salt by special classes of persons who do not come within the four castes.

 A general rule is laid down in regard to change of occupation in distress: one can take up the **vṛtti** of a **varṇa** lower than his own, but never that of a higher. Neither the Kṣatriya nor the Vaisya can for example teach the Veda, though they learn [it](# "यथा मनुः (१०, ९५ ) –नत्वैव ज्यायसीं वृतिं अभिमन्येत कर्हिचित ॥ तत्र मेधा- तिथिः-'किंतु सत्यपि स्ववृतित्यागे न ज्यायसीं ब्राह्मणवृत्तिं कदाचिदप्यभिमन्येत । इमां करोमीति चेतसि न कुर्यात् । (२, पृ. ३५८).").



THE DUTIES AND OCCUPATIONS OF THE S'ŪDRA

 The S'ūdra is enjoined to serve the higher castes for his living, but, even when he is employed under any one else, his devotion must be to the first **varṇa**. This is due to the circumstance that members of that caste are fully taken up with their religious and educational duties and need others to look after them in their daily life. The **Brahmacärin** and members of the last two **āśramas** are looked after by the**Brāhmaṇa Gṛhastha**, who is accordingly held up as the special object of the **S'ūdra's** service (p. 265). The **S'ūdra's** is helped by simplification of his religious duties. Unlike the twice-born he needs no **mantras**, that must be laboriously learnt. An ordinary salutation (**namaskāra**) in his case is equal to **mantras**. If he has the means, he may make gifts (**dānam**). The S'ūdra's livelihood and remuneration must be **equitably** fixed by the higher castes (p. 267). If he serves a Brāhmaṇa, he must be fed with the remains of the food served to guests. The S'ūdra is of "one-birth (**ekajātiḥ**)” i.e. he need undergo no **upanayana**. It does not mean that he gets no education. He must perform**srāddha** to his ancestors (p. 269). He may live by trade, arts and crafts. The "five fires" which the **dvija** maintains by **mantra**and **ritual**, he can worship by merely making a salutation (**namskāra**), addressed to the deity concerned in the sacrifice. Salt, honey, wine, curds, butter-milk and clarified butter may be unhesitatingly accepted from the S'üdra by those of the higher**varṇas**. The S'üdra is pre-eminently fitted for trade in all articles, including those forbidden to the **dvija** (p. 270). The rule of the **Kālikāpurāṇa** that the S'üdra should not sell honey, hides, **surā**(rice-beer) lac and meat, is explained away by **Lakṣmīdhara** as inapplicable to him, if he cannot but trade in them for a livelihood (p. 270). The S'ūdra cannot become an outcaste thereby (p. 271). Love of Dharma is enough to ensure his salvation. A S'üdra is also advised not to accumulate wealth, if it will make him arrogant and undutiful (p. 271). He has no interdictions as to what he may eat or drink (p. 273). He is advised to listen daily to the **Purāṇas** (p. 273), in lieu of the Vedic study that is enjoined for **the dvija**.



THE SOURCES AND USESof WEALTH

 The prescription to the Brāhmaṇa of a life of stern discipline, bordering on austerity, must not lead one to think that Dharma-śāstra looks down upon wealth and upholds an ascetic ideal. Since so much space has been devoted in his exposition to the regulated life of the **srotriya** householder, Lakṣmīdhara finds it necessary to correct such wrong notions of the ideals of life, and he devotes a chapter (ch. 15) to the sources and uses of wealth (**dhanam**). It is not an end in itself but a means to an end. Poverty is its own bane. The curse of the poor is their poverty. The way to sin is easy for them (**daridrāḥ pāpakāriṇaḥ, p. 263**). Every religious rite needs wealth for its performance. To acquire wealth is therefore both necessary and commendable. But the justification of wealth lies in the ways in which it is acquired and it is spent. Ill-gotten wealth defeats the purposes for which it is utilized. Wealth acquired in disreputable ways (e.g. bribes, discounting, sale of forbidden articles, gambling, theft, violence and deceit) is black wealth. It is only with wealth come by in legitimate ways that one should fulfil his enjoined duties (p. 262). The lawful sources of wealth are inheritance, gains of a fortuitous nature like treasure-trove, profits of trade, conquest, money-lending, and agriculture (p. 259). The gains of learning, marriage presents, gifts from pupils and gains of valour (in the case of Kṣatriyas) form "white" or pure wealth, fit to be put to pious uses. What is obtained by money-lending, agriculture, trade, crafts, bride-price and the return made by those who have been helped, is mottled (s'abala) wealth. The results of the application of wealth are affected both by its origin and by its destination.

  Unless wealth is increased, society cannot function. Neither can it if wealth is merely saved up and not put to proper use. The **dvija** who makes no proper use of his wealth has acquired it in vain. Life is uncertain. Let him spend two-thirds on Dharma and use one-third for himself, advises the **Bhaviṣyapurāṇa**(p. 264). The **Mahābhārata** (p. 263) advises the expenditure of a fourth of a man's income on Dharma, a fourth on his pleasures, and a fourth on investment. The **Mārkaṇḍeya**-**purāṇa** (p. 264) suggests the dedication of a fourth for "other-worldly" purposes,



a half for maintenance and enjoined **karma**, and an eighth for investment. The proportions are only illustrative, and what is implied is that wealth should be earned in just ways, and used in devout and unselfish ways, that one should use it to live comfortably and that some part of one's earnings should be put by as saving or investment.

THE DUTIES OF THE SNĀTAKA (CH. 17)

 The student, on the termination of his studies, signifies in a formal manner the end of his life as a Brāhmacãrin by a ceremonial bath, which is termed **snāna**. Thenceforth he is known as a snataka. The vows which he had observed as a student are done with. He has to undertake a fresh set of vows, expressly and by implication, to suit the new life he is about to enter. As a householder continues the **vrata** (the vows) so taken on the termination of studentship, the rules which govern the life of the **snātaka** till he marries and settles down, are also binding on the householder. The **smṛtis** signify the importance of the transition from one stage to another in a **dvija's** life by  
emphasizing the duties of the **snätaka**, the inhibitions (**yama**) and observances (**niyama**) imposed on him by his new life. A survey of them yields a picture of the ideal householder's life. It illustrates the ethical code of **Dharmaśāstra**.

 The remainder of **Gṛhasthakāṇḍa** is taken up with the treatment of the ethics of family life. Beginning with a general review, under the caption of the "vows of the **snātaka**,” (ch. 17) Lakşmīdhara proceeds to deal (ch. 18) with **yama-niyama** the comprehensive collection of what the householder should not do and what he should do. The major headings of conduct resulting from these regulations are then dealt with in fuller detail under purity (**saucam**), continence (**brahmacarya**), residence (**nivāsa**), speech and restraint of speech, movement, compulsory duties etc.

 The discipline already described in the enunciation of the duties, normal and abnormal, of the Gṛhastha of each of the four varṇas has for its object the creation of the type of conduct and behaviour described in the pages which follow, Lakṣmidhara is a pioneer in delineating the life of Gṛhastha in a  
systematic manner. He shows his erudition and power of critical



selection in focussing on particular virtues the dicta in the scattered sources, which hold them up as ideals of the common man. The consideration of the rules begins with the declaration of **Manu** (IV, 13) that whatever ways of livelihood, among those enjoined, the **snātaka** may elect to follow, he should resolve to practise a mode of life, to be indicated, which will ensure for him salvation (**svargam**), long life (ā**yuṣyam**) and fame (yasas) (p. 274). Both visible and invisible benefits are assured to the person who keeps the vows.

  His first duty is to perform the rites laid down in the Veda, and elucidated in the law-books. His sacrifice to the Supreme Being (**Brahma-yajña**) consists in daily Vedic study. "Vedic study is a great sacrifice. It destroys immediately the most heinous sins." (p. 275). Diligence in selecting proper objects for his benefactions, gifts to the meritorious, pleasing fellowmen and enjoying lawful pleasures sum up, in Āpastamba's view, the whole duty of man (p. 275). Conjugal fidelity is enjoined. Marriage is for perpetuating the line and the discharge of a natal debt. One should be careful as to who he moves with. He should cultivate his relations (**bandhu**). Secrecy in discharging the natural functions (food, evacuation, dalliance) business austerity and wealth are advised by Vasiṣṭha (p. 277). One should maintain a deportment suited to age. Cows should receive special care (p. 278). Where there is any excellence, there the goddess S'ri resides invisibly; and where the opposite prevails, she ceases to dwell. In three extracts, (which remind one of the declaration of **S'rī Kṛṣṇa** in the [**Bhagavadgītā**](# "Bhagavadgita, X, 19-42 (vibhūti-yoga).")),' Lakṣmīdhara thus indicates obliquely what one should aim at having and avoiding. In the Brāhmaṇa who is expert in Vedic study, in the fire of sacrifice, in the bodies of sacrificers, in the chaunt of the Veda, in the man of rectitude, in the chaste householder, and in the man who is intent on helping others does S'rī dwell. In men of restrained lives, devout, grateful and active, does she also dwell. She is present in every one who does his appointed duty (p. 283) and avoids those who do not. The ways of the man who is guided by the Veda and laws, who is served by the good, are to be followed. In perplexity or doubt let one tread the path trod by his ancestors (p. 286). It is unnecessary to seek the



solitude of the forest for emancipation; it is as easy to attain in the home, which by suitable conduct can be transformed into a hermitage (**tapovanam**, p. 287). The truthful, contented, chaste, patient, undeceitful, studious, and unenvious man is the real householder, not the man who merely sets up a home (p. 288). Devotion to parents, consideration to dependants, steadfastness, and suavity are virtues enjoined by Gautama (p. 290). A householder does not merit the name unless he has charity, kindliness, a forgiving nature, modesty, steadiness, intelligence, a grateful disposition and zeal (p. 291). Truth, sacrifices, gifts and austerity are the marks of Dharma, according to Bṛhaspati (p. 292). A good deed has immediate reward in the Kaliyuga. Ahimsāwins heaven. One should protect his body, because when it decays the means of right living go (p. 294). The mind should not rove over sense gratification (p. 295). Selfrestraint, compassion (**dayā**) charity (**dānam**) and steadfastness in keeping to vows of conduct are virtues for all, but especially for the Brāhmaṇa. Compassion should extend to all living beings-**sarvabhūtānukampanam dayā**(p. 293). Steadfastness (**dṛḍhavratatvam**) is reflected in the performance of the three daily prayers, the worship of the gods, the sacrifices which include muttered prayers (**japa**-**homa**), meditation and the practice of enjoined duties. Härīta defines (p. 294) **Dṛḍhavratatvam** as forgiveness, restraint, benevolence, freedom from cruelty, reverence to teachers, personal cleanliness, ordained baths, muttered prayers, sacrifices, performance of austerities (tapas), study of the Veda, truthful speech and contentment (**santoṣa**). After enumerating the virtues which are obvious, Lakṣmīdhara proceeds, following the smṛtis, to specify a number of minor prescriptions and inhibitions, which are not of the same importance. Thus, a **snātaka** should wear a gold ring on his right hand; he should not enter a temple wearing shoes; he should not eat oil-cake; he should not sleep by day; he should not invite a guest expecting to be invited in return; he should not touch with his foot cows, Brāhmaṇas, the fire and cooked food; he should not spit, pass urine or ease himself in temples or facing the Sun; he should not ascend a hill-top, or enter a house on fire; he should not laugh loudly; he should take no exercise or go to sleep immediately after food, nor attend to any



important civil or religious duty with his clothes-knot loose (**muktakaccha**).

 He should neither take poison nor play with serpents. Collyrium should be applied only after one has cleaned his teeth (p. 299). He should not associate with misers, revengeful persons, outcastes, men who have married before their elder brothers, harlots and their companions, mean persons, liars, dancers, spendthrifts, scainps, and men who speak evil of others. He should also avoid travelling alone (p. 299). He should shun men who are generally suspect, and those who hate the words and persons of sages as well as the scriptures. Some of these rules are trivial and are mixed up with worldly wisdom. The **snatakas** should not mention to any one of his having seen a rain-bow! The underlying idea in all these rules is that he who essays to enter the life of a householder, or enters it, should not regard himself as free to act as he likes, but he should regard himself as bound as much by rules of etiquette and proper form as by the regulations of high morality.

YAMA-NIYAMA

  Manu has a challenging dictum. He declares that one should observe even in distress the inhibitions (**yamān**), and need not observe what is enjoined (**niyamān**) ([IV, 204, p. 302](# "The wiseman shall always observe the restraints, but not necessarily the observances. Not observing the restraints, and keeping the observances alone, he falls' (IV, 204, trn. Jha).")).'**Lakṣmīdhara**, like Medhatithi, interprets this dictum not as allowing the neglect of enjoined observances (**niyamān**) but as indicating the preference (in case of comparison between them) to be given to the inhibitions [(**yamas**)](# "नाऽनेन नियमानामेव सेवोच्यते, किंतु यमानां नियमेभ्यो नित्यतरत्वम् ॥ ....तथा च शिष्टस्मरणम् । 'पतति नियमवान् यमेष्वासक्तोन तु यमवान्नियमालसोऽवसीवेत् । न नियमानसमीक्ष्य बुद्धधा यमबहुलेष्वतिसन्दधीत बुद्धिम् ॥ ' इति (मेधातिथि, १, १. ३९७)."),' and as implying that**niyamas** alone should not be follwed, to the neglect of **yamas**, as the two must be practised together. Buehler has therefore rendered **yama** as "paramount duty" and **niyama** as “[minorduty](# "Laws of Manu, (S.B.E., XXV, 1886), p. 160.")." The two are thus distinguished by Medhātithi: **Yamas**



(restraints) are negative, of the nature of prohibitions, such as "the **Brāhmaṇa** should not be killed," "wine should not be drunk," and so forth; **niyamas** (observances) are positive in form, of the nature of something to be done, e.g. "one should daily recite the Veda" and so forth. As examples of **yamas**, he names **ahimsā** (abstention from injury to others), **satya**-**vacanam**, (truthful speech), **brahmacaryam**, (continence), **akalkatā**, (unostentatiousness), and **astheyam** (non-thieving); and as illustrations of **niyamas**, he mentions **akrodha** (freedom from**anger), guru-s'usrūṣā** (service to the teacher), **s'aucam** (purity),**āhāralāghavam** (moderation in food) and **apramāda** (avoidance of error). Lakşmīdhara cites the identical illustrations (but from **Vyāsa**), and explains the **yama** of **brahmacaryam**, not as absolute continence, but as avoidance of prohibted sex-intercourse (**pratiṣiddha**-**maithunam**, p. 302). The conduct enjoined directly, or indirectly by specifying what should be avoided, is further illustrated in Lakṣmīdhara's quotations. Benevolence, meditation on God, calmness, sweet speech, and self-restraint are additional yamas specified by Yājñavalkya, who names five further **niyamas**, viz., compassion (**dayā**) daily baths, daily silence (**maunam**), fasts (**upavāsa**), sacrifices and control of the sex impulse (p. 303). The difference may be regarded as grading the virtues as of the first and second order of magnitude. The brief enumeration is amplified by comments which bring many other virtues under those named. Thus,**ahimsă** is said to imply concentration on one's **karma**, in a frame of mind which avoids sin (p. 304). Cruelty (**hiṁsā**) is not merely infliction of physical injury or pain, but includes creation of anxiety (**udvega**-**jananam**), anguish (**santāpa**), and illness (**rujā**-**karaṇam**) causing loss of reputation (**atikrama**), and denying means of overcoming distress (**pratiṣedha**). Doing any of these is as much a violation of the principle of **ahimsā** as physical cruelty and hurt. Whatever obscures the perception of reality, as smoke obscures the flame, is untruth (a-**nṛtam**, p. 305).

TRUTH

 Among **yamas**, **ahimsā** is placed first. Truth (**satyam**) comes next. The opposite of truth is falsehood (**anṛtam**). No



virtue has been held in greater regard in Indian literature and life than truth. There is nothing midway between truth and untruth (Sata. Br. I, i, 1, 4). The glory of the gods springs from their adherence to truth. Untruthfulness is the mark of the Asura [(Sat. Br. IX, v, 1, 16)](# " द्वयं वा इदं न तृतीयमस्ति। सत्यं चैवानृतं च सत्यमेव देवाऽनृतं मनुष्या॥ (शतपथब्राह्मणे, १, १, १, ४) ॥ तत्रैव, ९, ५, १, १६ यथा – सर्वा असुरा अनृतम् ॥").Guile and deceit are untruth. The Vedic exaltation of truth and condemnation of mendacity, open and covert, is continued in the epics. Truth is an essential element of the righteous life as pictured in the **Rāmāyaṇa**. The state is founded on truth ; so is the [world](# "सत्यवेवानृशंसं च राजवृत्तं सनातनम्। तस्मात्सत्यात्मकं राज्यं सत्ये लोकः प्रति- ष्ठितः ॥ (अयोध्याकाण्डे, १०९, १०))"). The pledged word is honoured because to do otherwise will be to be false. Truth outweighs the acquired merit of a thousand horse-sacrifices ([**Mahābhārata**](# "अश्वमेधसहस्रं च सत्यं च तुलया घृतम्। अश्वमेधसहस्राद्धि सत्यमेव विशिष्यते ॥ (अनुशासनपर्व, ११०, २९)")) All good rests on [truth](# " तपो धर्मो दयश्चैव सर्वं सत्ये प्रतिष्ठितम् ॥ सत्यं वेदास्तथाङ्गानि सत्यं यज्ञास्तथा विधिः । व्रतचर्या तथा सत्यमोङ्कारः सत्यमेव च॥ प्राणिनां जननं सत्यं सत्यं सन्ततिरेव च। सत्येन वायुरम्येति सत्येन तपते रविः ॥ सत्येन चाग्निर्दहति स्वर्गस्सत्ये प्रतिष्ठितः । सत्यं यज्ञस्तपो वेदाः स्तोभा मन्त्रा सरस्वती ॥ तुलामारोपितो धर्मः सत्यं चैवेति नश्श्रुतम्। समां कक्षां धारयते यतः सत्यं ततोऽधिकम्॥ यतो धर्मस्ततः सत्यं सर्वंसत्येन वर्द्धते॥ (शान्तिपर्व, १९७, ८१–७६)"). The epics inculcate over and over again a love for absolute truth, by precept and illustration. Absolute truthfulness in thought, word and deed is the ideal. After initiation, it is among the first virtues enjoined on the student. It is the first of the teacher's commandment: to the [Brahmacārin](# " वेदमनूच्याचार्योऽन्तेवासिनमनुशास्ति॥ सत्यं वद॥ धर्मं चर॥ स्वाध्यायान्मा प्रमदः ॥ ...सत्यान्न प्रमदितव्यम्॥ ( तैत्तरीयोपनिषत्, १, ११)."). God is the lover of truth (**satyakāma)**. He is vowed to truth (**satyavrata**) and He is resolved on truth [(**satya-samkalpa**)](# " स व्रूयान्नास्य जरयैतज्जैर्यते न वधेनास्य हन्यत एतत् सत्यं ब्रह्मपुरमस्मिन्कामाः समाहित एव आत्मापहतपाप्मा विजरो विमृत्युर्विशोको विजिघत्सो ऽपिपासः सत्यकामः सत्यसङ्कल्पो यथा ह्यबेह प्रजा अन्वाविशन्ति यथानुशासनं यं यमन्तमभिकामा भवन्ति यं जनपदं यं क्षेत्रभागं तं तमेवोपजीवयन्ति॥ ( छान्दोग्योपनिषत्, ८, १, ५)"). The practice of truth enables a person to realize the moral perfection which is God.



 The opposite of truth is falsehood (a **nṛtam**). “Where

there is no truth, there is falsehood. (**nātra ṛtamastītyanṛtam**, p. 306)." There is nothing midway between truth and falsehood. (**Sata. Br. I, i, 1, 4**). The duty to speak the truth is contained in the **yama** (inhibition) that one should not speak a lie. Falsehood is of two kinds: express (**asatyam**), consisting in saying what one knows from personal knowledge to be not the fact; and implied (**viṣamvāda**), misleading fraudulently by withholding the facts as known to one (p. 309). To correct the tendency to speak falsehood, one should remove the causes which impel one to tell lies: e.g., anger, hatred, fear, cupidity, desire to propitiate, suspicion, ostentation, error, desire to kill an enemy or rob him of his wealth, and the habit of idle talk (vṛthā kathana).

 Falsehood is differently classified according to the occasions causing it, or the context in which it is uttered. They are: trade-lies (**paṇitānṛtam**), in which buyer and seller utter or act falsehoods to gain an advantage; abuse of confidence (**pratyayānṛtam)**; falsehoods told with pious intention (**sukṛtānṛtam**) ; and ordinary lies (**sādhāraṇānṛtam**). Betrayal of trust, false testimony and falsehoods in judicial proceedings are three divisions of mendacious abuse of trust (p. 307). Falsehoods springing in gifts, sacrifices, and austerities are three divisions of **sukṛtānṛtam**(p. 309). He who makes a gift and withdraws or or denies it, he who collects money for a sacrifice and does not perform it or does it perfunctorily, and he who declares that he is going to practise austerities (tapas) and does not, come under this head. It is possible to deceive men but not the higher powers, which witness all human actions. Retribution of a kind graded to the occasions and purposes for which a lie was spoken awaits, after death, the person who uttered it (p. 308). The gravest lie is that told to gain land. A lie told a woman to get her to consent to sex-union (improperly) is classed with this grave offence (p. 308). Perjury is visited by punishment in five successive births (p. 307). Postmortuary punishments are the unseen (**adṛṣṭa**) consequences of lying.

CONFLICT OF YAMAS-TRUTH VERSUS CRUELTY

 Compassion to all living beings (**dayā**) and avoidance of cruelty (a-**himsā**) are related virtues. **Ahimsā** stands first among



the obligations (**yama**) which no one should neglect. What is to happen if by speaking the truth, one will cause death to a living being (**prāṇivadha**)? Can truth be spoken which will kill compassion (**dayā**) and cause cruelty, as when a man, intent on torturing a person or amimal asks a question, which, if truthfully answered, will enable him to fulfil his cruel intention? It may happen that a falsehood will help the purpose of compassion and avoid cruelty, where cruelty is imminent. In such a case, it is held that a lie, uttered with the deliberate intention of saving a living being from death or torture, is venial though silence, which does not betray the fugitive will be better (p. 306). Such silence is suggested as a middle path between telling a hateful truth and uttering a lie. Manu (p. 305), in a famous aphorism, has laid down that one "should speak the truth, and should also speak what is agreeable but should never speak a disagreeable truth, while in no circumstance should he utter an untruth because it is agreeable." The conclusion aimed at is: speak, if you must, what is both true and agreeable." According to this view, Harita defines truthful speech" (**satyavacanam**) as that which does not lead to hurt to a living being (**prāṇivadha**), which is not open to censure (**yacca aninditam**) and which is free from deceit (**chalarahitam**). This is akin to the dictum of the **Mahābhārata**: "Falsehood sometimes leads to the triumph of truth, and truth dwindles into untruth. Whatever is most conducive to the good of all beings is held to be the truth." "[What makes for the greatest good of all creatures is the highest truth](# "सूक्ष्मागति र्हि धर्मस्य बहुशाखा त्यनन्तिका॥ प्राणान्तिके विवाहे च वक्तव्यमनृतं भवेत् ॥ अमृतेन भवेत्सत्यं सत्येनैवानृतं भवेत्॥ यद्भूतहितमत्यन्तं तत्सत्यमिति धारणा।विपर्ययकृतोऽधर्मः पश्य धर्मस्य सूक्ष्मताम् ॥ (बनपर्व, २१३, २-४) अपि च -यद्भूतहित- मस्यन्तं तद्वै सत्यं परं मतम् ॥ ( वनपर्व, २१६, ४७)") ".

PERMISSIBLE DEVIATIONS FROM TRUTHFULNESS

 In estimating the culpability of a statement which is not true, both intention and occasion must be considered. A false statement uttered in a game or in fun is not really falsehood. S'rī Rāma made fun of the amorous demoness S'ūrpanakhā by



telling her that Lakṣmaṇa was unmarried and needed a rare wife like [her](# "ततः शूर्पणखां रामः कामपाशावपाशिताम्। स्वेच्छया श्लक्ष्णया वाचा स्मितपूर्वमथा ऽब्रवीत् ॥ कृतदारोऽस्मि भवति भार्येयं दयिता मम। त्वद्विधानान्तु नारीणां सुदुःखा ससपत्नता ॥ अनुजस्त्वेष मे भ्राता शीलवान् प्रियदर्शनः। श्रीमानकृतदारश्च लक्ष्मणो नाम वीर्यवान् ॥ अपूर्वी भार्यया चार्थी तरुणः प्रियदर्शनः। अनुरूपश्च ते भर्ता रूपस्यास्य भविष्यति ॥ (अरण्यकाण्ड, १८, १-४)."). It is a hāṣa utterance. If the gravamen of an offence is in the way it leads others to take a particular line of action, such a pleasantry, to one who had no sense of humor, and took it seriously, may be wrong. Lovers are known to say when they make love, a great deal more than they intend. If they speak what is not true, the falsehood is venial, having been uttered under stress of uncontrollable emotion. In such a case, there is indeed an advantage gained by telling a falsehood. Five occasions in which falsehood can be spoken without sin, are named by Harita (p. 310). They are play, amorous dalliance, the time of marriage, when life is in danger and there is risk of loss of all one's belongings. The idea is elaborated and extended. Danger to life may be to one's own life or to save the life of any other living being (**prāṇinām jīvitāya**, p. 311). From the saving of life, it is extended to the idea of doing good to Brāhmanas and to cows (**go-brāhmaṇa-hitānṛtam**). The **Mahābhārata** holds that 'the virtuous man commits no sin if he utters a falsehood, if it be to save the wealth of others or for a religious[purpose](# "प्राणात्यये विवाहे च वक्तव्यानृतं भवेत्। अर्थस्य रक्षणार्थाय परेषां धर्मकारणात् ॥ (शान्तिपर्व, १०९, २४).").'' Manu lays down that “ no crime causing loss of caste (**pātakam** ) is committed by a false assertion (**vṛthā sapatha**) to lovers, during marriage, for fodder for cows, for fuel, and to protect a [Brāhmaṇa](# "कामिनीषु वीवाहेषु गवां मध्ये तथेन्धने। ब्राह्मणाभ्युपपत्तौ च शपथे नास्ति पातकम् ॥ (८, ११२.).")." Vasiṣṭha enumerates the five occasions in which an untruth may be [spoken](# "उद्वाहकाले रतिसंप्रयोगे प्राणत्यये सर्वधनापहारे। विप्रस्य चार्थे ह्यनृतं वदेयुः पश्चा- नृतान्याहुरपातकानि ॥ (वसिष्ठ, १६, ४६)."),' as in **Hāritā's**dictum, cited above, but he substitutes " for the sake of a**Brāhmaṇa** " for " playful utterance " (**svaira**-**vākyam**, p. 310).



 This is justification of the means by the end. That it did not win universal assent is shown by Gautama's dissent from the principle, which Lakṣmīdhara has pointedly cited (p. 311): "Some (eke) hold that falsehood spoken at the time of marriage, in dalliance, in jest or when offering condolence in bereavement (**ārta**-**samyoga**) is not sinful; but, if such things are said, in reference to one's own teacher (**gurvartheṣu**), it is not venial; for, even a trivial falsehood in connection with the teacher, conceived in the mind (and not even spoken), destroys him and ancestors and descendants to seven generations." Maskarin interprets guru so as to bring all honored relations' like the maternal uncle, under the [term](# "गुरुप्रयोजनेष्वविवाहादिष्वनृतं न वदेत्। मातुलादिगुर्वर्थेष्वपि न वदेत् विशेषतः आचार्यार्थेति ॥ (मस्करी, पृ. ४०३).").The illustrations given by the commentators of Gautama (Maskarin and Haradatta) of the occasions for venial falsehood, which Gautama would exclude from honoured persons (guravaḥ) show the extension given to the exempted occasions. Thus, according to Haradatta a breach of promise of the gift of a girl at the moment of marriage is no sin; or a promise prior to [union](# " विवाहकाले कन्यवरयोस्त्वपि गुणेषु कथितेषु, इदं ते दास्यामीति प्रतिश्रुत्याप्रदाने न दोषः ॥ तथा मैथुनसंयोगे इदं ते दास्यामीति उक्त्ता मैथुने कृते तस्यादानेऽपि न दोषः ॥ (हरदत-मिताक्षरा, पृ. २०२).");the hiding of defects of either party, in order to bring about the union seems, according to [Maskarin](# "विवाहकाले कन्यागतेषु वा अवलक्षणेषु शोभनकथने नानृतकथनदोष इत्यभिप्रायः ॥ (मस्करी, पृ. ४०३)."),' to have been held defensible under this exemption.

 In defence of the doctrine, which offends conscience, the position taken seems to be this. After all, truth is only fidelity to the highest Reality, and **apparent** truth, which does not harmonize with Reality is not **real** truth. Among the thirteen forms which truth assumes are compassion (**dayā**) and abstention from injury (**ahimsā**). Truth is also fidelity to oneself. If the utterance of truth is incompatible with these aspects of Reality, or with the ultimate purpose of human action being hita (good) of mankind, to that extent it may be kept back or modified. The social aspect of truth is seen in the confidence between individuals



which it [inspires](# " Cf S. K. Maitra, Ethics of the Hindus, 1925, p. 219."). The social bond is however broken if falsehood, cruelty and hardness of heart come between man and man. Subjectively, truth is only consistency of one's [ideals](# "Cf Trush is in fact fodelity to the highest order of reality .It is therfore defined as immutable eternal and unchangeable ,( M.A Buch ,Principle of Hindu Ethics 1921,p 108)")." Both the social aspect of truth and its harmony with one's own conscience therefore suffer if the utterance of it, irrespective of context, causes social harm and mental [discord](# "Falsehood leaves a sting in the mind of the conscientious man. He does not got Ātmanastuṣṭī, which, in the elect, is held to be the test of Dharma. He has not been true to himself.")."

 There are limits to the application of the defence. In uttering falsehood, there should be no personal advantage and there should be advantage to some one else, if it is to be construed as venial. Making a promise to a fractious child to make him cease crying is venial. To assure a person who is very ill, whose agony is sure to be increased and whose end may be accelerated if he knows the truth, that he is getting better may be brought under the exception of **prāṇātyaya**. Deliberate fraud to bring about a marriage will not come under the exception of **vivāha**. The illustrations furnished by the commentators appear to apply the defence only to cases in which a marriage has already been settled or is in course of celebration. Even there, if withdrawing is justified, on any of the grounds specified for cancellation of a marriage agreement, covering the withdrawal by a statement which is not true can, according to some commentators, come within the **vivāha** exception. Falsehood uttered in dalliance is restricted to that occurring in lawful wedlock, and will not obviously apply to seduction or a promise made to a prostitute. In view of the paramount duty of speaking truth any extension of the six or seven specified exceptions, by analogy (**atidesa**) will be strictly scrutinized. Lying for trivial matters will not be protected. Many of the conventional lies of modern social life, such as asking a guest, who has long outstayed his welcome, if we should really go and cannot prolong his stay, will be barred as opposed to truth, and not covered by the exceptions. It should be noted that the dicta specifying the exceptions do not claim to make untruth truth; they only release the offender from



the expiation, and dire consequences that otherwise await falsehood. **Yudhiṣṭhira**, the eldest of the **Pāṇḍava** brethren, who never deviated from truth, had much pressure put upon him to make him reluctantly agree to mislead his preceptor Droṇa into believing that his son **Asvatthāman** had been killed. "If Droṇa fights even for half-a-day," he was assured, "thy army will be annihilated. Save us then from Drona! Under such circumstances, falsehood is better than truth. One is untouched by sin if he utters a lie to save a life. Falsehoods spoken to love-sick women (**kāminīṣu**) or in marriages, for feeding cows, (**gavām bhakte**), and when a **Brāhmaṇa** is in misfortune (and has to be rescued), are not sinful." The persuasion was applied by S'ri **Kṛṣṇa** himself. The double effect of the deception of Drona was seen later, when the sinless **Yudhiṣṭhira** had to come within sight of hell, though he was not consigned to it. It is noteworthy that in a section on what one may speak and not speak (**vācyāvācyam**, pp. 343-357) there is not a word condoning falsehood. On the other hand, it is pointed out there that the sin of slander is enhanced by its being untrue (p. 356).

AVOIDANCE OF THEFT (A-STEYAM)

 The right of property is sacred. Grhastha life is the only one in which it can accrue. A householder who violates it acts suicidally. This is why the offence of theft is held in special detestation. The appropriation of things, great or middling in size or small, by force, or silently or in secret is theft" (p. 312). Several acts are theft constructively. Taking what is not given (**adattādānam**), taking more than is given (**anatisprṣṭagrahaṇam**), misappropriation of funds collected for pious purposes (**anirdesopayoga**), denial of wages to servants (**vetanādānam**), running away with collections (**yācita**-**niryātanam**), refusal to return what has been left in deposit with one (**nyāsāpalāpanam**), using false weights and measures (**chadma**), appropriation except in distress of what has been given to relieve it (**vyasanayoḥ anupāyagrahaṇam**), failure to pay what has been promised (**pratisrutya adānam**), and failure to apply to the service of gods and for sacrifices what has been collected expressly for them (**devatā-anabhisambandha**)—-are all construed



as theft. Avoidance of them is as obligatory as avoidance of open theft. The theft of certain articles is considered even more heinous than of others. Among them are gold, cows, land, gifts, women, clothes and carriages. The postmortuary effect of the theft of land is, according to Gautama, consignment to hell; and so also in the case of the theft, for purposes of criminal intercourse, of married and unmarried women [(p. 314)](# "सर्वंभूमौ । हरणे नरकः । अप्सु मैथुनसंयोगे च॥ (गौतम, ध. सू., १३, १७-१९) ॥ ‘मैथुनसंयोग’ च परस्त्रीगमनादौ इत्यर्थः। संयोगग्रहणात् कन्यालक्षणादौ अपि। एवं च हरणेऽपि नरको द्रष्टव्यः ॥ इति मस्करी, पृ. २२१ ॥ Buehler (S.B.E., II, p_248, has not translated these aphorisms correctly.").A man's wealth is his life, **(yadetad-dhanam ityāthuḥ prāṇā hyete, p. 315)**. Robbing a man of his wealth is robbing him of his life. To take the wealth of a Brāhmaṇa, or of a god, and particularly of the Guru (preceptor) is a sure way to hell (p. 316).

 Residence in hell for an aeon may expiate the sins of the slayer of the Brāhmaṇa **(Brahmaghna**), but he who steals a Brāhmaṇa's gold can never get pardon. He who resumes the grant of land made by himself or by a predecessor lives in hell for sixty-thousand years [(p. 318)](# "This imprecatory verse is usually added to land grants. Cf. A. C. Burnell South Indian Palaeography, 1878, p. 97."). This is why not stealing is a high virtue (p. 319).

 There are, however, by analogy with the conditions in which falsehood may be spoken without incurring sin, exceptions to the rules condemning theft. The principle governing the exemptions is four-fold: the status of the person who appropriates, the nature of the article taken, the purpose for which it is taken and the quantity appropriated. To take fuel for the religious fire, grass for a cow, fruits and flowers as well as forest-produce for daily worship, and water from wells belonging to another without the owner's permission, are permissible and not theft, whether done openly or not. But, the quantity taken must not exceed what is necessary for the purpose. Certain grains can be taken openly, so long as no more than a handful at a time is taken. A member of any of the three first **varṇas**is permitted, if hungry, to take two sugar-canes, not more.



Certain grains, which are no one's property (i.e. which grow wild) may be appropriated according to necessity. The Brāhmaņa, who takes from another's land two sugar-canes, must be then travelling and occupationless (ksīṇavṛtti, p. 318). A resident Brāhmaṇa cannot benefit by this rule. The underlying principles of the exemptions are two: (1) the right of ownership is subject to the absolute needs of religious services and of the bare subsistence needs of other human beings; and (2) the right to what belongs to others is limited by one's bare necessity and the minimum needs of one's religious duties.

PURITY (S'AUCAM)

 The concept of purity is wide. It embraces cleanliness, personal (**sārīram**) and impersonal. The latter includes purity of objects handled (**arthaśaucam**) and kinship-purity (i.e., freedom from impurity arising from the birth or death of relations). These are types of external purity. Inward cleanliness is mental purity, arising from dislike of sinful acts, and it springs from humane and holy thoughts. A man must make himself the temple of the most exalted intentions, feelings and thought.

 What a man sacrifices, or throws into the fire or gives in charity or offers to the gods becomes futile, if done by one who has not made himself clean inwardly as well as externally. Purity is lauded by **Hārīta** (p. 325) as the road to duty (**dharmādipatha**), the abode of the Veda (**brahmāyatanam**), the chosen residence of prosperity, the pacifier of the heart, the darling of the gods. the displayer of the chosen soil of the body and the awakener of the mind. The comprehensive description shows its paramount importance for secular and spiritual endeavour.

BRAHMACARYAM

** Brahmacarya**, the fifth **yama** of the Gṛhastha, is not mere celibacy. It is merely the garb of studentship, not studentship itself. It does not mean mere abstention from sex-intercouse or celibacy. To the householder, Brahmacarya is of five kinds, each of which confers invisible benefits, ascending from the attainment after death of three higher worlds, to **svarga** (heaven).



These are keeping away from the wives of others (chastity), attention to one's own wife, absention from conjugal intercourse during the new and the full-moon, sex-union with the wife at appointed times, i.e., when she is fertile, and continence within marriage (**urdhvaretas**), when it is enjoined. **Brahmacarya** is for the Grhastha not the negation but the regulation of marital[duties](# "This why Śri Kṛṣṇa is called the first Brahmacărın."). It means also abstention from extra-marital sex-thoughts, which may be generated by the contemplation of nude statuettes. (p. 327).

NIYAMĀḤ

** Niyama** is enjoined conduct, what one is asked to do, as the right thing to do. **Yama** is inhibited conduct, which indirectly shows what one must do, as the proper thing to do. Natural impulses lead men to courses from which they have to be drawn back. Cruelty, falsehood, appropriation of what be-longs to others, uncleanliness and uncelibacy are evil things. To resist and overcome them is virtue. Life will be intolerable if these impulses are not conquered. Hence the insistence on the superiority of the inhibition of impulse to prescribed conduct.

  Patience (**akrodha**), straight-forward conduct (**ārjavam**), unsinfulness (a-**kalkatā**), contentment (**saṅtoṣa**) and service to teachers (**guru**-**s'usruṣā**) are the five enjoined virtues, which correspond to the five inhibitions or **yamas**. Psychological analysis of the five **niyamas** yields a list of actions that one must avoid, if he is to live a proper Gṛhastha life. From unrestrained rage (**krodha**), affecting the mind and temper, spring many bodily manifestations, such as facial distortion. Pride, jealousy, envy and hatred, which burn one's rival or enemy,' spring from anger. In speech they manifest themselves by harsh expressions, in action by assaults. He who conquers his anger, and is patient even when reviled, spat upon or assaulted, and shows forgiveness, transfers his evil to his enemy and reaps a divine reward (p. 329). 'Blessed are the meek.' Whatever is done by an infuriated person is lost. Straight dealing consists in avoidance of all kinds of subterfuge (**jaihmam**), and concealment of feelings. Un-sinful conduct consists in the avoidance of a number of



actions, which are classified as born of pride, cruelty, servility and boastfulness. Sin consists in opposition to austerity, Vedic study and the injunctions of the Veda, as well as in the forcible appropriation of the wealth of others. Contentment is the highest virtue for a householder (p. 332). Service to the **Guru** is enjoined in order that one may be disciplined by it. Lakṣmidhara refers us to what he has said on the subject in **Brahma**-**cārikāṇḍa** for the other virtues.

 The householder is saved from the jaws of Death by following the inhibitions and prescriptions (p. 333).

'DESTRUCTION OF FAMILY' (KULANĀS'ANAM)

 Among the evils to which a householder may become a slave some only affect him, while others will effect the ruin of his family and its reputation. The indication of these is a necessary supplement to the treatment of **yama-niyama**. By the appropriation or waste of the wealth of temples, robbery and oppression of Brāhmaṇas and extravagance are families ruined. The king's service, litigation, sacrificing for those for whom a Brāhmaṇa should not sacrifice, begetting children on S'ūdra woman and denying the future rewards of good actions are other causes of a great family's ruin (**Manu**, p. 334). Lying, running after the wives of others, eating forbidden food, inter-course with those with whom sexual relations are prohibited, cruelty, theft, pursuit of un-Vedic duties, and abandonment of duties which ensure friendship, are other causes of the ruin of a great family that Dakṣa enumerates (p. 335).

WHERE SHOULD A HOUSEHOLDER LIVE?

 A Brāhmaṇa Gṛhastha is not usually burdened with a superfluity of goods and is therefore in a position to choose his place of residence with considerable freedom. The underlying principle in the choice should be the selection of a place where he might practise the duties laid on his order, and where he will be supported by the king or the community. He should avoid contamination or associations that are likely to pull him down. On these principles, a number of rules for his guidance in



choosing a dwelling place are given in the smrtis. These Lakṣmīdhara has summarized. First of all, he should not dwell in a kingdom of which the ruler is a **S'ūdra** (**Manu**, p. 338 ; **Visnu**, p. 339). As one who has contravened the rules by ascending the throne a S'ūdra king might not be responsive to the teachings of the smṛtis. Nor should he live in the dominions of a warlike king**(jigīṣu**), as he might find peaceful pursuits interrupted by wars or invasions (p. 339). Secondly, he must not reside in an area full of persons who are unrighteous (**adhārmika-janāvṛte,**p. 339), who are heretics, or are of **pratiloma** castes. in which disease is endemic should be avoided. Unless he is in good health, a Brāhmaṇa's daily rites will suffer (**vyadhyādi bahule, p. 338; upaspṛṣṭe, p. 339)**. Nor should he dwell in a village which has no physican, none who will help him with loans, no **śrotriya**, who can cooperate in special rites like **srāddhas**, and no river in which he can have daily immersions (p. 339). Bathing in water taken from a well is not approved. The man who lives for a year in village with only one well, or who has married a vṛṣaḷī (see p. 337, note) becomes a S'ūdra [(p. 337-338)](# "पितुर्गेहेतु या कन्या रजः पश्यत्यसंस्कृता। भ्रूणहत्या पितुस्तस्याः सा कन्या स्मृता॥ (इति अत्रिकाश्यपौ उद्वाहतत्वे)").He should not live in a town (p. 337), for town life is incompatible with his daily pursuits; and he should not enter towns (**Āpastamba**, p. 338). He should not live in the midst of heretics, candalas and passionate people. He must select a village which furnishes readily the ingredients for his daily rites, and which provides an environment suitable to his regulated life.

 But, he can dwell in **Naimiṣāranya**, where the **Purāṇas** were first given out, in any locality which has a shrine, or on the banks of a sacred river, or at a sanctuary (**āyatanam**) like Avimukta (**Kāsī**) as death in these places leads to heaven.

RESTRAINT ON SPEECH (VĀCYĀVĀCAYAM)

 Mere truth-telling is insufficient for harmonious social intercourse, which alone can furnish the householder with a proper background for his activities. He must know when and how to speak, without violating truth. Suavity is among the necessary



virtues. He should avoid useless argument (p. 344). troversies, like marriage alliances, should be only with equals. To avoid quarrels, one must learn to put up even with small losses. He should avoid an indecent action **(na marma spṛśet, p. 344)**. He should refrain from criticizing cows, sacrificial fees and unmarried girls. He must not incur the enmity of powerful men (**mahājanavirodha**). He should join no group of idle talkers. He should avoid conversation with drunken and mad persons. Nor should he converse with women who have been recently confined, nor with those in their menses. He should not mention the **tithi** and **nakṣatra** of a day (p. 346). He should avoid harsh speech. He should not draw attention to a cow which is grazing in another's field. He should also use complimentary expressions in referring to the food and drink served out to him as a guest. He should avoid gossiping. He who reviles a woman whom he had once used, or one who has losther youthful looks, is a sinner. So is one who speaks ill of the food he has had in another's house. He should not speak slander, particularly of chaste women, teachers and good men. (p. 350). He must avoid blasphemy. Let him neither sing his own praise nor run down others. When insulted let him keep silent (p. 351). Let him cover up his ears when he hears slanders of Brāhmaṇas or yogins (p. 352). He should on no account hold discussions with his elders, teachers, children and servants. He should not criticize the king (**na kuryāt ṇrpōpekṣḥa, p. 353**). He should utter no complaints (**niṣthuram**). Nor should he speak sarcastically of deformed persons. Truth may give offence when one calls a S'ūdra a **vṛṣala** and an outcaste a **patita**. Let him not do so, but remain silent, since to describe them in any other way will be untruthful (p. 359). Good and bad dwell in human speech. So cultivate inoffensive speech. The tears of innocent persons, who have been caluminated, burn up the sons and cattle of the slanderer (p. 356).

HOW THE HOUSEHOLDER SHOULD TRAVEL

(GAMANA-PRAVES'ANA)

 Ordinarily the householder will not travel much, but he may have to do so out of necessity. The rules to be observed



by him, both for his religious regimen and for his security, as indicated in smrti and **Purāṇa**, are summarized by Lakṣmidhara (pp. 358-371). If he is an āhitägni, his journey will be possible only after he has made proper arrangments for the worship of his fires. It is of course assumed that none of his daily duties or special duties will be omitted during the journey. The rules that are given relate to the time of the day for the journeys, the vehicles to be used, the company to be avoided on the road, the way in which villages should be entered, the ritual on entering a town, the honor to be shown to persons to whom it is due whom one might meet on the way, and the preliminary permission to be sought before starting on the journey. The future of the journey is believed to be capable of prognostication by observing omens. These are therefore detailed, and the Grhastha is advised to return home if the omens are unfavourable and then start again, after propitiating S'iva (S'aṅkara) and Viṣṇu (Madhusūdana), but if the bad omens recur, he is advised to abandon the journey (p. 368).

  To begin with, the Grhastha is warned against wandering from house to house, without a purpose (**animittataḥ**). He should not attend a **yajña** without invitation (p. 369). He may however visit a sacrifice merely to pay his homage to the gods. He should not join crowds, nor come close to a forest fire (**dāva**) nor visit the birth-place of a sage **(ṛṣīṇām prabhavam)**. An old legend is cited (p. 371) to indicate the inauspiciousness of going out in search of a lost brother. In a caravan, those who have their food, without asking a needy companion to share it, are contemptible (p. 371). A village should be entered only by the road leading into it (**sṛtyā**, p. 370), and by its gate.

 The journey must be begun after taking permission of the household fire and the Brāhmaṇas of the village (**Vasiṣṭha**, p. 361). The journey must not be made in vehicles drawn by aged and tired animals, or untried animals or asses (p. 362), or by mutilated animals (p. 358). In crossing a river, the**tarpaṇas** to the gods and the manes should first be performed and water-libations offered (p. 362). No river should be crossed by swimming across it (p. 362), nor in a dilapidated boat **(na bhīnnayā nāvā, p. 362)**. On his way, the Gṛhastha should avoid entering forests alone, or forts which he has not known to be



free of enemies (p. 362). The draught animals should not be tired out, but must be fed, watered and not driven in the heat of the day. The journey should be pursued at hours which will not conflict with the daily duties. One should not travel alone, or with bad men, or with outcastes or with alone a woman (p. 361). Shoes and umbrellas may be used. One should not travel without his water pot (**kamaṇḍalu** p. 360). On the way, if he meets cows or Brāhmaṇas, he must walk round them, from the left towards the right (**pradakṣiṇa**) as a mark of veneration. This should also be done when any auspicious omen occurs. He should not intervene when a lecture is in progress (p. 361). He should not come between a Brāhmaṇa and his fire (p. 361). The omens, which are detailed, should be carefully studied (pp. 364-368). At mid-day and at midnight, or after partaking of meat at a **srāddha** or in the twilight, one should not halt at four cross-roads (**catuṣpatha**, p. 373). At night one must not camp under a tree (**vṛkṣamūla**) or in a deserted house or temple (pp. 373 and 375).

TABOOS OF THE HOUSEHOLDER

 An ancient belief is that one engaged in pious work is exposed to all sorts of [risk](# "श्रेयांसि बहुविघ्नानि ॥"). He may lose his power or effectiveness if he is not ceremonially pure. Impurity may arise in different ways. The usual sources of impurity are contact with a person impure by birth, occupation or for the time being. Women in their menses, and for some days after giving birth to a child, are temporarily impure (p. 345). The**yūpa** or sacrificial post is impure, and one has to purify himself after touching [it](# "Viṣṇusmṛti, XXII, 69"). A dead body is impure. So are a place of burial and a cremation ground. Impurity may spring from speech, sight, hearing or even thought. One who hears scandalous talk of a holy person or abuse of gods must shut his ears with his palms (p. 352). One who speaks an untruth should rinse his mouth (ācāmet) after he has done [so](# "यथा मनुः (५, १४५) --सुप्त्वा क्षुत्वा च भुक्ता च निष्टीब्योक्ताऽनृतानि च । पीत्वा- पोऽध्येष्यमाणश्चाचमेत्प्रयतोऽपि सन् ॥").



 Taboos are indicated not only by suggesting that certain things or animals or persons are impure and convey impurity by contact, but by specifying what should not be passed over, or trod upon. There are things that one should not even gaze on--anavalokanīyāni. The Grhastha leads a life which is punctuated by daily and seasonal rites. He has to be particular about such inhibitions, which are different in character from yama-niyama by not being based on moral grounds. Many of them are arbitrary and ritualistic. Reasons are not given for the prohibitions, though in some cases they are capable of surmise. Lakşmīdhara summarizes the householder's taboos in two sections (27 and 28).

 First, there is the rule, based on very ancient belief, that to step on the shadow of a person is wrong. "The man of discrimination (**prājñaḥ**) says Manu will not step over intentionally the shadow cast by gods (i.e., idols), elders, (**guravaḥ**)**snātakas**, the teacher (**ācārya**), the ministers of the king (mantriņām) as well as the tawny cow (**kapilā**)." \[p. 372\]. The verse, as given by Medhātithi, is slightly different: it has king (for ministers) and **dīkṣita** (the initiate) instead of cow. Medhātithi makes out that the taboo relates only to stepping on the shadow of a father or a teacher, and does not include the shadows of maternal uncles etc. The reason for the inhibition is to be found in the fear that close proximity does not reflect the respect which should be shown to the person, whose shadow is touched (idol, flag-staff of temple, p. 374, king, minister,**guru, ācārya, dīksīta, and kapilā**), or fear of their being contaminated by such an indirect contact with an ordinary householder; or, to take the further taboo suggested by Yājñavalkya, (I, 152) viz., stepping on the shadow of a grown-up woman, not his own wife, it may show familiarity or lack of delicacy. Nor should a householder allow his own shadow to be stepped on by an outcaste (patita), a man suffering from chronic disease, a caṇḍāḷa, a eunuch or an enemy. Here, the ground for the prohibition is obviously fear of infection or danger as well as of impurity. Some of the taboos are clearly sanitary rules, such as the prohibition of stepping on used water and unguentpowder, urine, ordure, blood, mucus, spittle or vomit, (p. 373), ablutionary basins, (**āvapana**), sweepings, dust, ashes, bones,



skulls, and clippings of hair (p. 374). The inhibition of going near cremation grounds, trees standings near burial mounds or the junction of cross roads (catuṣpatha) at night, suggests fear of haunted places (p. 374). Avoidance of houses which have been shut up suggests it also (p. 375). The advice to kee away from women at untimely hours is precautionary (p. 375).

 The prohibition against looking at the rising and setting sun and moon is ritualistic, for they must be worshipped whenever seen, and only at proper times (p. 377). The sun is to be looked at to purify a householder when he has seen those who should not been, (p. 377) such as libellers of the gods and religion. One may look at soma, the fire as well as the sun in order to overcome the impurity that arises from a sight of ingrates (**kṛtaghna**) and other undesirable persons. A naked woman is not to be looked at, nor a nude man (p. 378). One should not watch a bullfight (p. 375). The well-known rules of Manu prohibiting seeing a wife when she is eating, at her toilet or sitting at her ease or when anointing herself are meant to prevent her embarrassment and to keep the mind of the Gṛhastha from carnal thoughts.

WHAT A GṚHASTHA SHOULD NOT GIVE A ŚŪDRA

 The last **varṇa** is treated in the smrtis almost as one of mental immaturity. This will account for the prohibition of instruction of the S'üdra in Vedic rites whose results are invisible (**adṛṣṭa**, p. 338). The S'ūdra is not to have food which remains in the cooking vessel, after the household has eaten. He is not to be given the sacrificial remains (**haviṣkṛtam**). He is not to be instructed in vows, i.e.. he need not be induced to undertake them. Lakṣmīdhara remarks that the rule against giving what remains of the food of the house to a **S'ūdra**does not apply to a S'ūdra dependent on the Brāhmaṇa, who should have the food (p. 380). The S'ūdra should neither be taught the Veda nor learn it. Since the purpose of learning it is to perform the sacrificial rites, which are not indicated as necessary for the S'üdra, the transgression of the rule is construed as due to a wish on the part of the S'ūdra to set at defiance the settled order of castes and stages of life (p. 380).



The purpose of Dharma being the maintenance of **varṇāśrama**, anything that would lead to its destruction must be penalized. The relation of religious instructor and acolyte, if established between Brāhmaṇa and S'ūdra, may lead to familiarity and undesirable intimacies that will ultimately result in what is most dreaded in Dharma viz., **varṇasaṁkara** or **saṁkara**. The nine causes which lead to **saṁkara**, according to Bṛhaspati (p. 414) are using with one of a lower caste or varna the same bed or seat, sitting in the same row with him when eating, mixture of the cooking vessels and cooked food separately provided for both, sacrificing for one of a lower varṇa, teaching him the Veda, eating with him from the same plater and intermarriage (yoniḥ).

AVOIDANCE OF SAṀKARA

 It is the primary duty of the vipra (Brāhmaṇa) to resist the tendency to **saṁkara** or **Varṇasaṁkara**. Manu (X, 24) ascribes the rise of **saṃkara** to the sexual union of the men of one **varṇa** with the women of another, to the marriage of women who should not be married (sagotrā for example) and to the neglect of the duties of one's own [**varṇa**](# "यथा मनुः (१०, २४) व्यभिचारेण वर्णानामवेद्यावेदनेन च। स्वकर्मणां च त्यागेन जायते वर्णसङ्करः॥"). A verse which Lakṣmīdhara has cited in **Vyavahārakāṇḍa** from Manu (but which is not to be found in the authorized versions of **Manuṣmrti**) states that **varṇasaṁkara** arises from both**anuloma** and **pratiloma** [unions](# " कृत्यकल्पतरौ व्यवहारकाण्डे, वर्णानुलोमप्रतिलोमपर्वणि मनुवचनं यथा - विप्र क्षत्रियविशूद्राः चान्ये वर्णास्त्रयो द्विजाः । प्रतिलोमानुलोमाच्च तैर्युतो वर्णसङ्करः ॥"). This is at any rate Lakşmidhara's own view. When he deprecates **varṇasaṁkara**, he shows his disapproval of even **anuloma** intercaste unions. That Manu held both types to come under **saṁkara** may be inferred from his allusion to both as sprung from **saṁkara**. Yama, on the other hand, as cited by Lakṣmīdhara himself in the **Vyava**-**hārakaṇḍa**, states that by the transgression of the prescribed order **varṇasaṁkara** ensues, i.e. by pratiloma [unions](# "तत्रैव यमो यथा - मर्यादायाः विलोपेन जायते वर्णसङ्करः। भ्रष्टवर्गास्तु पतिताः भ्रष्टाचाराः पतन्ति ते॥"). In



**Gṛhasthakāṇḍa**, in treating of **saṁkara**-**varjanam** (pp. 413-417), he is concerned only with the influences leading to caste mixture. The quality of the Brāhmaṇa should be protected from sexunion with women of other castes, business dealings with bad men, receipt of forbidden gifts, mean occupations and low companions. Sin springs from sex-union, physical touch, lying together, eating together from the same platter, familiar converse and living together with those of lower varņas (p. 415). From this fear, Hārīta (p. 416) rules that a Brāhmaṇa should not use clothes, shoes, and **Brahmasūtra** worn by others. If persons of different **varṇas** are placed in the same row at dinner, contact (**saṁkara**) may be avoided by six intervening objects viz. fire, ashes, water, a door, a pillar or a corridor (p. 417). Lakṣmīdhara treats **saṁkara** in **Gṛhasthakāṇḍa** from the standpoint of preserving the integrity of **srotriya** life, in **Rājadharmakāṇḍa** from the point of view of the king's duty to maintain the purity of the **varṇas**, and in **Vyavahārakāṇḍa**from the point of the legal results of **saṁkarajāti**. The analysis of the causes that lead to the sapping of the foundations of**varṇa** and the growth of **saṁkara** is designed to warn the Gṛhastha of the first **varṇa** against the dangers, and to prescribe to him the duty of avoiding mixed marriages (**saṁkaravarjanam)** and everything that may lead to it.

OTHER ELEMENTS OF A MORAL LIFE

 The **yama-niyama** group and the taboos do not exhaust the constituents of **Gṛhastācāra**. They lie in the very springs of human action. Indian philosphical systems have endeavoured to analyse and classify them, in order to determine what is morally right and what is wrong. The classification of virtues in those systems is corollary to their respective enquiries into the impulses which determine human activity.

 Different systems adopt different [groupings](# "The classification follows that of Pras'astapāda's commentary on the Vaiseṣikasūtra.").According to the **Vaiseṣikas**, the springs of action are to be found ultimately in desire (icchā) and its opposite, **dveṣa** (aversion), the object of desire being pleasure (**sukha**) and the object of aversion pain



(**duḥkha**). The causes of pleasure are both natural and moral. The life of a spiritual person cannot be explained entirely as a reaction to natural causes, ignoring his individuality. An educated and disciplined nature, like that of the srotriya's or**siṣṭha's**, easily overcomes natural promptings. Such a person derives satisfaction by doing what his knowledge of the self (**ātmajñāna**) shows to be right. The springs of desire are**kāma** (craving), abhilāṣa (appetite), rāga (passion), **saṁkalpa**(resolution to act), **kārunya** (compassion), vairāgya (desire to renounce), **upadhā** (insincerity), **bhāva** (latent desire), and cikīrṣa (itching for action). The roots of aversion (dveṣa) are **krodha**(anger), revengefulness (**droha**), latent ill-will (**manyu**), inability to bear the good qualities of another (**aksamā**) and inability to forgive the superiority of another (**amarṣa**). The two last may be likened to jealousy and envy. The good man must endeavour to discipline, control, regulate and strengthen the former and overcome the [latter](# "The grouping follows that in Vätsyāyana's Nyāyabhāṣya and Jayanta- bhatta's Nyāyamanjari.").

 The **Naiyāyika** traces all emotions back to delusion (**moha**) as the root cause. From it spring both the attraction of a favored object (**rāga**) and the repulsion (**dvesa**) towards an unfavored. All actions, both good (**subha**) and bad (**asubha**), go back to these two. Delusion (**moha**) leads to erroneous cognition, (**mithyā**-**jñāna**), perplexity (**vicikitsā**) and vanity (**māna**). From rāga (attraction) are born sex-craving (**kāma**), dislike to see another do well (**mātsarya**), worldiness (**spṛhā**), thirst for life (**tṛṣṇā**) and greed (lobha). From **dveṣa** (repulsion) spring rage (**krodha**), envy (**īrṣyā**), jealousy (**asūyā**) malice (**droha**) and unforgivingness (**[amarṣā](# "The Vyāsabhāsya on the Yoga-sūtras is followed in this classification. The three have been conveniently summarized by S. K. Maitra's Ethics of the Hindus (1925), chs. III and IV.")**).

 According to Patañjali, most of the vices may arise from one or other or from a mixture of three evil qualities: delusion (**moha**), anger (**krodha**) and greed (**lobha**). He teaches the ways of gradually overthrowing these weaknesses, and regaining the mental equilibrium which they have disturbed.

 In all these systems the assumption is that the tendency to evil is there, and has to be corrected or overcome radically.



 The **Naiyāyika** classifies unrighteousness (**adharma**) as bodily (**sārīra**), oral (**vāk**) and mental (**mānasa**). Forbidden sex gratification (**maithuna**), theft (**stheya**) and cruelty (**himsā**) are**sārīra** offences, as they depend for their fulfilment on the body. The vices of speech are lying (**mithyā**-**bhāṣaṇa**), tart speech (**paruṣavāk**), insinuation (**sūcana**) and idle speech or gossip (**asambaddha**). The mind is responsible for three vices: malevolence (**droha**), covetousness and atheism. The virtues are similarly classed as bodily, mental and pertaining to speech. Under the first come charity (**dāna**), protection of the distressed (**trāṇa**) and service to others (**paricaraṇa**). In the second are placed truth (**satya**), kindly speech (**hitavacana**), pleasant speech (**priyavacana**), Vedic chaunt (**svādhyāya**), compassion (**dayā**), uncovetousness (**aspṛhã**) and faith (**sraddhā**).

 Patañjali classifies the virtues as five: **ahimsā, satyam, asteyam, aparigraham** and **brahmacaryam.**

 The classifications in the smṛtis of the virtues and vices neither agree with each other nor with those adopted by any Indian philosophical system. The reason is simple. No single vice or virtue can be traced back to a single cause. Causes are usually mixed. Observation leads one to stress a cause more than another. Common agreement exists, however, between all these writers in regard to what are morally admirable and what are condemned.

 The avoidance of a number of vices or weaknesses, which a householder should not be influenced by, is indicated compre-hensively by Lakṣmīdhara in a chapter (ch. 30) intended to supplement the ethical prescriptions and prohibitions indicated earlier in the treatise. Āpastamba is cited (p. 382) for the avoidance of fourteen vices, which are to be rooted out (**nirghāta**), by practising their opposites. These vices burn up the spirit**(bhūta-dāhīyān)**. Hārīta classes all the vices to be overcome as five according to their source: those pertaining to the belly (**audara**), the seed (**retasa**), the passions (**kāmaja**), rage (**krodhaja**) and complacency (**harṣaja**). He places vices of the stomach first, because purity in food is the cause of purity of spirit**(āhārasuddhau satvasuddhiḥ, p. 383)**. The householder should be careful not to eat forbidden food and not to over-eat. The retention of **retas** (sperm) is next in importance. **Kāma** is 'Fire



incarnate' (**Kāmo hi bhagavān Vaisvānaraḥ**) and is at the bottom of all activity, legitimitate and illegitimate. **Viṣṇusmṛti**(p. 385) specifies three classes of vices as leading to hell : those springing from desire (**kāma**), from passion (**krodha**) and from covetousness (lobha). Manu (p. 386) places atheism (**nāstikya**) first among six vices to be avoided, which, excluding itself, are named as **dveṣa, dambha** (ostentation), **māna** (pride),**krodha** (rage) and **taikṣṇya** (violence). Hārīta gives a second classification of eighteen vices, which should be avoided. He groups them under three heads: (1) those which appertain to the body, viz., eating what should not be eaten, feeding those who should not be fed, drinking what should not be drunk, sacri-ficing for those on whose behalf one should not perform **yāga**, receiving gifts from persons from whom they should not be received, running after the wives of others and robbing others of their wealth; (2) those which spring from speech, viz., harsh speech, falsehood, contentiousness, and sale of sacred lore by teaching it for money; and (3) those which arise from the mind, viz., hurting the feelings of others (by abuse, slander and insinuation), ill-will to others, anger, covetousness, delusion and egotism (**ahaṁkāra**). Devala adopts the same three-fold classification, and specifies, with illustrative definitions (pp. 387-393), twelve vices springing from the mind, and four, which are **sarīraja** (connected with the body). These alone are cited by Lakṣmīdhara. Devala like the **Naiyāyika** and **Pantañjali**, regards delusion (moha) to be the root of all vices (p. 393). About thirty-six vices are enumerated in all, some of which overlap. Restraint of the senses, without going to the length of unnatural repression, control of the mind, and avoidance of anti-social actions are the implications of these interdictions.

MISCELLANEOUS RULES

 A number of scattered rules prohibiting certain acts have been collected and presented together in a separate section (pp. 394-413). Though mainly addressed to the Brāhmaṇa householder, they are applicable, wherever possible, to those of other **varṇas** also. Several of them are mere sanitary rules. Many of them are empirical. Prohibition of scratching the



ground with the toe-nails (p. 400), carrying in the hands one's own shoes (p. 403), biting of finger nails (pp. 398, 401, 402), rubbing foot on foot in the process of washing the feet (p. 403) and drinking from the cupped palms of the hands (pp. 400, 405, 406) come within this category. What remains of the oil used to anoint the head should not be used to anoint the body (p. 398). Scratching the body is condemned (p. 399). So are cracking the finger joints (p. 400) and stamping on the ground with the feet (p. 400). Concern for the personal dignity of the Brāhmaṇa Gṛhastha is obviously behind the injunction that he should not sing, dance, play on musical instruments (**vāditra**) or whistle (p. 400), or shout or jump (p. 401). It may also account for the rule that he should not awaken a sleeping person (pp. 401-403). A householder should avoid the morning sun, the smoke of a burning corpse and the use of a broken seat. He should not snap grass with his finger nails. He should not eat or gnaw stones (p. 402). He should not swim across rivers (p. 402). In short, involuntary or voluntary action of every sort, for which a good purpose cannot be found, should be avoided (**na niṣphalam karma kuryāt, p. 402**). Everything that a householder does must be decorous, deliberate and purposive. Nude bathing and sleeping (p. 406) and looking at a nude woman are forbidden (p. 378). The pollution of water (p. 406) is prohibited. Nuisance must not be committed on roads (p. 401).

 Ritualistic purity is behind some prohibitions, e.g., approaching the sacred fire in an unclean condition, or without **yajñopavita** (sacred thread) and **uttarīya** (a second cloth) (p. 405). The sacred fire should not be polluted, or treated with discourtesy by extending one's feet towards it, or be extinguished by water (pp. 405, 407, 408). It should not be fanned into a flame by being blown upon by the mouth.

  The Veda should not be recited when one is not ceremonially pure **(asuddhaḥ svādhyāyam na kurvīta, p. 404)**. The names of gods, sages and ancestors should not be uttered when one is impure (asuci p. 405); he should sip water and purify himself before doing so.

 Eating and drinking, and even sleeping are almost rituals to a householder. This is why he is told that he should be pure (i.e. be bathed, wear fresh clothes, p. 417, and sip water) before



he begins eating, that he should not lift the vessel from which he drinks with his left (i.e. unclean) hand, and that he should be pure when he retires to bed (pp. 404-405). He should not eat standing (p. 410).

 Irreverence should be avoided. Veneration is due to gods, Brāhmaṇas, the fire, kings, the Sun and cows. Extending the feet towards them or touching them with the feet is disrespectful. Without proper reason, he should not even touch them with his hand (p. 405).

MAGNIFICATION OF THE BRĀHMANA

 The magnification of the Brāhmaṇa is the tribute to his poverty and austerity, and to his unremunerated educational and spiritual services to the community. A life of passive quietism makes him a proper object of special protection, as women are from their weakness. To be born a Brāhmaṇa is deemed a piece of rare fortune, the result of good deeds in a past life **(durlabhā brahmayoniḥ, brahmabhāvo na sulabhaḥ, p. 415)**. This is why everything possible must be done to maintain the purity of his blood by preventing **saṁkara**, and the high standard of his life and conduct by warning him off low associations (p. 415). The teacher who initiates a **dvija**, he who teaches the sacred lore, parents, and cows are not more immune from injury than the **Brāhmaṇa**. (p. 394). A **dvija** who merely lifts his arm against a Brāhmaṇa is destined to detention in hell for a century, he who strikes him even with a blade of grass will be reborn in inferior wombs for twenty-one lives, and he who makes the blood of the **Brāhmaṇa** flow will be torn by ferocious animals in the nether world (p. 394). For every drop of blood that is drawn from a Brahmaņa, the assailant, if a dvija (i.e. if he is even another Brāhmaṇa), will expiate by detention in hell for a thousand years (Manu, p. 395). The gods, the Vedas, cows and sacrifices, all dwell in the Brāhmaṇa. They are insulted when he is insulted, honoured when honour is shown to him, hated when he is hated (p. 395). The fire burns when one goes too near it, but it burns only the body; the anger of the (injured) Brāhmaņa burns from afar even one's reputation (p. 395). A tree which is cut down may grow again,



and if it is burnt it may sprout afresh, but the regermination of what has been destroyed by the wrath of a Brāhmaṇa is impossible (p. 396). Every one secures peace by the placation of the Brāhmaṇa. Let not a learned Brāhmaṇa, even if his appearance is mean, be treated with discourtesy (p. 397).

 The rules for the protection of the Brāhmaṇa are coupled with threats of post-mortuary penalties. It may be noted that they are addressed to all dvijas. Their incorporation in **Gṛhasthadharma** is to prevent persecution of those who by their birth and austerity stand at the head of society, in spite of their poverty and seclusion. The glorification of the Brāhmaṇa recurs in the **Rajadharmakāṇḍa**. There the emphasis is on the duty of the state to protect him by appropriate sanctions directed against those who infringe the inviolability of his person, and on the social and political services of the Brāhmaṇa which furnish other grounds for the special protection to be given him.

REITERATION OF CONDEMNATION OF SINS

 Certain heinous sins, which are likely to spring from familiar association, and degrade those who commit them are again specifically warned against. Prohibited intercourse with animals (p. 409) and adultery with married women are sternly condemned (p. 412). Among those with whom carnal intercourse is sinful are Brāhmaṇa women (other than the wife), sister, daughter, a woman of the same gotra as the offender, a**caṇḍāla** woman, a woman who has been sent out of caste, (**patitā**) and a nun (**pravrajitā**). Leading astray an unmarried girl, who is even within the allowed circle for matrimony, is a sin, but it may be condoned by a marriage in the **Gāndharva**form (p. 413).

RULES OF EXCLUSION: THE OUTCASTE

 Mere threat of postmortuary punishments cannot keep up the integrity of a caste or order. It must be followed up by a formal act of exclusion (**tyāga**), which will keep the persons who commit grave offences out of their own groups and from society. The exclusion corresponds to social ostracism or



excommunication. It must be distinguished as it is also termed**tyāga**, from mere abandonment of a person by those who are responsible for his or her maintenance and protection. An outcaste is the person to whom the former type of exclusion is to apply (patita). He is both a social and a moral outlaw. His evidence is inadmissible in a court of [law](# "Viṣnusmṛtz, VIII, 2."). He cannot receive a share in his patrimony, though he has a claim to[maintenance](# "तत्रैव (१५, ३२ ३३) यथा -- पतित- क्लीवअचिकित्स्यरोगविकलास्तु अभाग- हारिणः। रिक्थग्राहिभिस्ते भर्तव्याः ॥"). His death does not cause impurity to relations, he cannot receive on death the usual funeral [libations](# "तत्रैव (२२, ५६-५७) यथा – आत्मत्यागिनः पतिताश्च नाशौचोदकभाजः। पति- तस्य दासो मृताहे पदा अपां घटमपवर्जयेत् ॥"). His proximity suspends Vedic [chaunting](# "'तत्रैव (३०, १४) यथा -[अधीयेत] न शूद्रपतितयोस्समीपे ॥"). He cannot have a sacrifice done for him. He cannot look at a **srāddha** without contaminating it. Mere association with him for a year makes one an [outcaste](# "गौतमधर्मशूत्रे (२१, ३) यथा - ते [पतितैः ] श्चाब्दं समाचरन् ॥ मस्करिणोद्धृत (पृ. ३२५) कण्ववचनं यथा -- संवत्सरेण पतति पतितेन समाचरन् । यानासनशयैर्नित्यमित्याहु र्ब्रह्मवादिनः॥").\* An outcaste **ācārya** or relation, according to Āpastamba, cannot be even visited (p. 420). There should be no relation (**vyavāhara**) with an oucaste, barring certain exceptions. According to Vasiştha (p. 423), he who has taught the Veda to one to whom it should not be communicated, and he who sacrifices for a S'ūdra (**sūdra-yājaka**) also become outcastes (p. 423). He who does not formally cast off a patita (outcaste) or who deserts one who is not one, becomes an outcaste himself, according to [Gautama](# "'पतितात्यागी अपतितत्यागिनः पतिताः 1 (गौ. ध. सु., २१, १ ) ॥"). The exclusion becomes a social obligation. Gautama explains the effects of becoming an outcaste: he is deprived of the occupations open to the twice-born, and after death he is denied in the other life the rewards for his meritorious [deeds](# "द्विजातिकर्मभ्यो हानिः पतनम् । परत्र चासिद्धिः । (गौ. ध. सू., २१, ४-५) ॥"). A sacrificial priest (**ṛtvik**), who is ignorant of the rules of the sacrifice, and a teacher



(**ācārya**), who is unable to instruct, may both be given up, and they must be given up if they become outcastes (p. 420). To give them up in any other circumstance makes one an outcaste himself. Such irreverence and ingratitude deserve nothing less.

  Is the **tyāga** (abandonment, ostracism) of every patita permissible? All authorities ([including Kauṭilya](# "कौटिलीबे (पृ. ४८, २, १, १९ ) यथा – अपत्यदारं मातापितरौ भ्रातृृनप्राप्तव्यध- हारान् भगिनीः कन्या विधवाश्चअविभ्रतः द्वादशपणो दण्डोऽन्यत्र पतितेभ्यः । अन्यत्र मातुः ॥"))' are agreed that in no circumstance will the duty of a son to his mother lapse, and that even if she becomes an outcaste, he should maintain her and not turn her adrift. Āpastamba is emphatic on this point. He lays down that the mother, even if she becomes an outcaste, is entitled to be served with devotion by her son, as filial devotion to a mother is eternal (**nityam**, p. 421). By doing so, he will not violate the law (**na tu dharmasannipātaḥ syāt, p. 421)**. Does a similar liability accrue from his sons towards the outcaste father? The majority of authorities cited by Lakṣmīdhara (S'ankha-Likhita, Devala, Hārīta, and Vasiṣṭha) hold that the father should not he abandoned even if he is a[**patita**](# "The printed text of Vasiṣṭha (ed. Fuhrer) 93, v (p. 39) reads- पतितः पिता परित्याज्यो, माता तु पुत्रं न भवति । But all manuscripts of the Gṛhasthakāṇḍa insert न before परित्याज्यो ।"). Vasiṣṭha cities an old verse declaring the superiority of the mother to the father and the [preceptor](# "अयाप्युदाहरन्ति – उपाध्याद्दशाचार्या आचार्याणां शतं पिता । पितुर्दशशतं माता गौर- बेणाऽतिरिच्यते (१३, ४८) ॥").Manu who is not cited by Lakṣmīdhara in this [context](# "न माता न पिता न स्त्री न पुत्रस्त्यागमर्हति । त्यजन्नपतितानेतान् राज्ञा दण्ड्यः शतानि षट् (८, ३८९ ) ॥"), allows both parents (by implication) to be abandoned, if they become patitas. Hārīta is emphatically against the abandonment of the father (**na pitustyāga ucyate, p. 419)**. **Baudhāyana** lays down, however, the rule (p. 421) that there is to be no intercourse with outcastes, and the only exception is the outcaste mother, who is to be supported by the son, though he should not, however, speak to her. Gautama is cited by Lakṣmīdhara for the view that a son should



abandon the father, who kills the king, who sacrifices for the S'ūdra, who accepts money for his own sacrifices from S'ūdras, who instructs in the Veda those to whom it should not be communicated, who is guilty of the offence of **bhrūṇahanana**, who lives with the lowest castes or cohabits with a female of the lowest caste (p. 422). The quotation proceeds to indicate the formalities to be observed in outcasting the father. But, a dictum of Gautama (which Maskarin would read with this rule, op. cit. p. 318) in the next chapter (**XXI, 15, na karhicin-mātāpitroravṛttiḥ**) that the mother and father should under no circumstances be denied **susrūṣā** (honor and service) is also cited by Lakṣmīdhara (p. 420). Haradatta does not couple the two **sūtras**, but in explaining the second dictum, he cites the **sūtra**of Āpastamba (inf. p. 421) that a son's duty to the mother is eternal and it will not lapse even if she becomes an outcaste. Maskarin further explains that the 'slaying of the king' must be only by incantations, which, in the case of a tyrannical ruler, will be justified, and so will not lead to the exclusion of the father from caste. In the result, the position of Lakṣmīdhara must be understood as the endorsement of the absolute duty of supporting the mother in all circumstances, including her becoming an outcaste, and not abandoning her, and of leaving an option in the case of the father, who becomes an outcaste even in the circumstances detailed by Gautama (p. 421). **Caṇḍesvara** in his **Grhastharatnākara** has a very brief section on those who may be excluded or not," in which all the quotations are literally taken from Lakṣmīdhara, even to the wrong attribution of the sloka on p. 419 to Viṣṇu. By omitting altogether the dicta of Gautama and Baudhāyana, he upholds the view that both the parents are under all circumstances immune from **tyāga** by their sons, even if they become outcastes. His construction is more lenient than even Lakṣmi[dhara's](# "Grhastharatnakara, pp. 590-591,"). The sloka ascribed to Viṣṇu lays down that the wife, the pupil and the son, even if convicted of sinful acts, should be admonished and then abandoned (**paribhāṣya parityājyā**), as otherwise the head of the family will himself become an outcaste by condoning their offence. This is how the sloka



reads in the printed **Vaṣiṣṭhasmṛti** [(ed. Führer)](# "See the śloka attributed to Viṣṇu on p. 419 infra. It is from Vasiṣtha, XIII, 49. Caṇḍes'vara's reading is परिभाष्याऽपरित्याजा।").It may be asked—Why should they be admonished, if they are all also to suffer the heavier penalty of **tyāga**?' Admonition can only be to reclaim them, by making them purify themselves. Caṇḍesvara takes the clause as **paribhāṣya aparityājyā** to convey the meaning that one becomes an outcaste himself if he admonishes the wife, son etc. who have been sinful, and then abandons them also. He gets this sense by taking **parityājya** to be **aparityājyā**.

PROCEDURE OF EXCOMMUNICATION AND REHABILITATION

 The smṛtis detail the procedure to be followed both in sending a person out of caste, and in readmitting him to his caste, after proper penance. Lakṣmīdhara gives a description of the ritual from Gautama, S'aṅkha-Likhita, Vasiṣṭha, Manu and Baudhāyana. The chief steps in the ceremonial of exclusion from the **varṇa** are informing the culprit, his teachers and relations of his offence, as well as the king, and then taking him out on an inauspicious evening, after censuring him and finding him recalcitrant (p. 423), and having a broken pot, full of water, brought by a slave girl, or **asavarṇa** son, or a low person, he or she shall overturn it with the left foot. The relatives of the outcaste should then touch the low-born person, who has overturned the pot, and then return home with their hair loose, as in a funeral, and walk home in a dejected manner. The outcaste is as a dead person, and the final rites are performed for him (p. 424). The kinsmen observe death pollution for him for a day and a night. From that moment all relations with him cease. If he is the eldest son, he loses his share of the inheritance (though not his right to maintenance), and the **jyeṣthabhāga**(the eldest son's extra share) accrues to the next brother. The same rules are to be followed in the case of women, who are sent out of caste (**Manu**, p. 424) but they should be given a lodging near the house and be maintained, i.e. get their food and clothing.

 But for almost every sin there is a prescribed expiation. Most of the lapses for which one loses his caste are atonable.



If the outcaste is ready to atone, then the same persons, who were collected together when he was sent out of caste, are again summoned, the king is informed of the repentance and penance, a new vessel (gold, according to Gautama) is filled with curds, honey, clarified butter, water from a river and unbroken grain (**akṣatān**), and having put sandal paste and garlands over it, the pot is circumambulated from the left to the right (**pradakṣiṇī kuryuḥ, p. 425**). The kinsmen and kinswomen of the outcaste throw (after the prescribed **mahāvyāhṛti-homa**), the pot with its contents into water, chaunting the while "Appeased are the evils and evil talk, **sāntāni aśubhāni durbhāṣitāni** ”—Then after having bathed and put on fresh clothes all of them march back gleefully with the rehabilitated person, at their head, to his house, with the permission of his relations. He should thence-forward not be avoided by any one (p. 424).

 There are some offences, which lead to loss of caste, for which the expiation is lifelong. In such cases the purification is only death **(Yasya prāṇāntikam prāysecittam sa mṛtaḥ suddhyet p. 426**). All the prescribed funeral rites may then be done for him, beginning with the libations of water.

 Baudhāyana (p. 427) gives a formula of confession to be used by the rehabilated person, in which he owns up his offence and the purification he has undergone.

ABANDONMENT OF RELATIONS

  The rule that one incurs guilt by not joining in the exclusion of a guilty person applies only to those cases in which the expulsion has been for offences which make one a patita. To keep away from social intercourse with any one, who has not been expelled as an outcaste (**apatitān**), is itself a grave offence. There is no absolution for those who, out of hatred, desert or keep away from their teachers (p. 419). Abandoning a father, a preceptor and a sacrificial priest worthy of honour entails the loss of the wished-for worlds after death. Father, brother, daughter, sister, daughter-in-law and wife, who are not outcastes, cannot be abandoned merely out of hatred (dveṣa). Seniority in the family, and in wisdom, age or good conduct always entitles one to respectful treatment (p. 418). Even after expiation,



certain persons cannot escape their guilt, and commensality with them is forbidden (p. 427). Among them are murderers of women, children and suppliants (**saraṇāgata**-**hantṛn**). The man who is ungrateful (and returns evil for good) is classed with them. Conduct is the sole test. A **dvija** of bad conduct should be kept off as much as a S'üdra of similar conduct. A pure minded S'ūdra is deemed holier than one of a higher **varṇa** who is not a good man (p. 427).

 The Brāhmaṇa, who keeps within the bounds of Dharma, as laid down by the sages, treads the path of the elect. He is happy whether alive or dead. If he is physically unable to follow the rules, in their rigor, let him atleast pay them the homage of mental observance.

THE DISCHARGE OF THE NATAL DEBT (RŅĀPAKARṢANAM)

 The background of Hindu life presents two features. Firstly, existence is conceived as continuous, stretching from the imme. morial past into the future, life after life, through the force of**karma**. Secondly, it is held that a debt which is contracted can be liquidated only by full discharge. So long as one is in debt, he is unfree. The obligation stretches beyond life, into as many lives as witness the un-redemption of the debt. Release (**mokṣa**) is possible only for the debtless (**anṛṇī**). Short of full repayment, there is no way out. Among different types of existence, birth as a human being is most prized (p. 414). Those who go to paradise (**svargaloka**) enjoy lives of apparent happiness, but they can continue so only till their accumulated merit, which has given them the status, is [exhausted](# "यथा भगवद्गीतायाम् (९, २०-२१) – त्रै विद्या मां सोमपाः पूतपापा यज्ञैरिष्ट्वास्वर्गतिं प्रार्थयन्ते । ते पुण्यमासाद्य सुरेन्द्रलोकं अश्नन्ति दिव्यान् दिवि देवभोगान् ॥ ते तं भुक्त्वा स्वर्गलोकं विशालं क्षीणे पुण्ये मर्त्यलोकं विशन्ति । एवं त्रयीधर्ममनुप्रपन्ना गतागतं कामकामा").The gods can climb no higher. Man alone is the architect of his fortune. He rises or falls by his own actions, rising with the good, and being dragged down by the bad. Among human beings, those who are in a position to acquire merit (**puṇya**) in ordained ways, like **yajña**,**tapas**, **dāna** etc. are in a specially advantageous position, which



they owe to their good **karma**. Birth in the first **varṇa** is coveted on account of this advantage. One who is born a Brāhmaṇa must not therefore miss the opportunities for improving his spiritual position. It will be lost if he does not avoid **saṁkara**, sex-intercourse with women of other **varṇas** (**nānā-yoni-niṣevaṇāt, p. 414**), association with the tainted (**duṣṭebhyo vyavahārāt**), receiving gifts from the tainted (**duṣṭa-parigrahāt**) and intimacy with them (p. 415).

 One owes his **janma** to his ancestors. He is in their debt for his birth (pitṛ-ṛṇī). From them he derives his status in a**varṇa.**

 But, life can be supported only by favor of the gods, who control the seasons and otherwise support life. One is therefore in debt to the gods (**deva**-**ṛṇī**).

 The discharge of one's duties depends upon his knowledge and culture, which he has inherited as part of the traditional equipment of his race. The creators of these are the sages and seers (ṛṣī). He is therefore by birth a debtor to the sages (ṛṣi-ṛṇī). By marrying and having suitable progeny to continue the line, he perpetuates the work of the ancestors to whom he owes his being. By it his debt to them is discharged. To maintain the line is a primary obligation resting on every one. One who dies childless further suffers after death, for the neglect of this primary duty, by detention in one of the twenty-one hells. This hell is named Put; and because the son saves his father on his birth from liability to suffering in it, he is named **putra** (p. 432). The manes are nourished by balls of rice and libations of water offered by descendants (**piṇḍodaka**). By not begetting children, one deprives the manes of their means of sustenance in **pitṛ-loka**, and of avoidance of torments in hell (**Bṛhaspati, inf. p. 433**). Hence, if a man cannot raise issue on his savarna wife, he might raise sons by any means (**yadṛk tādṛk**). This has been interpreted as allowing a contract with another person, to share in the **piṇḍodaka** to be offered by the son generated on that other person's wife (p. 433). It seems implied in a dictum of S'ankha-Likhita also (p. 432). Lakṣmīdhara does not accept this interpretation but restricts the freedom to get a son somehow," or somewhere" (**yatra kvacana)** to an arrangement with a son-in-law that the daughter's



son will be a son to the maternal grandfather. This is in accordance with the views of Manu, who declares that a chaste woman goes to heaven after death, even if she is [childless](# "अनेकानि सहस्राणि कुमारब्रह्मचारिणाम्। दिवं गतानि विप्राणामकृत्वा कुलसन्ततिम्॥ मृते भर्तरि साध्वी स्त्री ब्रह्मचर्ये व्यवस्थिता। स्वर्गंगच्छत्यपुत्राऽपि यथा ते ब्रह्मचारिणः ॥ (मनु, ५, १५३-१६०).")that the [child](# " ") born to her by a person other than her husband is no more her child than the child born to a man on another man's wife is his child", that between a son's son and a daughter's son there is no difference, because even a daughter's son saves him in the next world, like a son's [son](# "'पौत्रदौहित्रयोर्लोके विशेषो नोपपद्यते । दौहित्रोऽपि ह्यमुत्रैनं सन्तारयति पौत्रवत् ॥ ( मनु, ९, १३९)."), and that the son of the appointed daughter shall offer the first funeral **piṇḍa** to his mother, the second to her father, and only the third to his father's [father](# "'मातुः प्रथमतः पिण्डं निर्वपेत्पुत्रिकासुतः । द्वितीयं तु पितुस्तस्यास्तृतीयं तत्पितुः पितुः ॥ (मनु, ९-१४०).").This view is supported by a quotation from**Ādityapurāṇa** (p. 434) which asks-“Why should a man be sad when he sees a daughter's son (on birth), since by that grandson he will cross the ocean of reincarnation?"

 The effect of the birth of a son is immediate in one respect viz., release of the father from the threatened torments of hell (p. 432). The son born should be one who will himself extend the line (**santānavardhanam**). The sonless man has no future "world" **(na aputrasya lokosti, p. 433)**.

  The son must, however, be one born of a wife of the same varna (p. 430). The father continues his existence in the son, and survives after death in the son (**mṛtopi prajā rūpeṇa vidyamāna eve bhavati, p. 430)**. He cannot be deemed to be his own self in a son born of a wife who is not of his own caste. The **proper** continuation of the line is the aim. He who sees a grandson in his lifetime is said to attain even greater merit, and he who sees the face of his great-grandson surpasses him**(Baudhāyana, p. 433).**

 In regard to the son, who would enable his father to discharge the pitṛ-ṛṇam, certain qualifications are laid down. It



is only the son who keeps down his evil propensities and leads a virtuous life, who "releases' his ancestors (p. 432). The bad son plunges his father into "darkness," as a leaky boat drowns its occupants (p. 434). Lakṣmīdhara explains the qualification as only implying the father's duty to train his son properly **(putro avaśyam anus'āsanīyaḥ iti tātparyaḥ, p. 434).**

 The remaining two debts to the sages and gods are discharged by **Brahmacaryā** (i.e., Vedic study), which conserves the ancient culture, for which the sages are responsible, and**yajña** (sacrifice), which propitiates the divine beings.

THE CULMINATION OF GṚHASTHA LIFE

 The life of the second **āśrama** begins with a ceremonial bath. It ends with another. The next stage, i.e., of the forest dweller (**Vānaprastha**) should ordinarily follow that of the Grhastha. Before becoming a **Vānaprastha**, the householder must have reached an age at which his longing for sense gratification has dried up. Manu declares that the Gṛhastha's time for retirement to the forest is when his skin becomes wrinkled, his hair turns grey and he sees a son's first [son](# "गृहस्थस्तु यदा पश्येद्वलीपलितमात्मनः । अपत्यस्यैव चापत्यं तदाऽरण्यं समाश्रयेत् ॥ (मनु, ६, २).").He is then ripe for retirement. He must have discharged his debt to the gods, sages and ancestors. The burden of his family and the care of his wife, if she is alive, young and unwilling to follow him to the retreat, must be devolved upon his grown-up and properly brought-up sons. The death of his passions makes him unfit to remarry and kindle another fire, if he becomes a widower, and the fire he has kindled has been used in the cremation of his wife. He will take with him to the retreat his **gṛhyāgni**, otherwise, as well as the **vaitānāgni** (sacrificial fire). This is Manu's [view](# "अग्निहोत्रं समादाय गृह्यं चाग्निपरिच्छदम् । ग्रामादरण्यं निःसृत्य निवसेन्नियतेन्द्रियः ॥ (मनु, ६, ४)."). The abandonment of all his effects, which is to precede the departure to the forest, is not to include the fires and the appurtenances needed for their worship. In due course, having reposited the Vedic fires within himself



**(samāropaṇam kṛtvā)**, he should live without the [fires](# " 'अग्निनात्मनि वैतानान्समारोप्य यथाविधि । अनग्निरनिकेतः स्यान्मुनिर्मूलफलाशनः ( मनु, ६, २५), इति मेधातिथिपाठः"). For lack of means to perform them in the forest, he may give up the **srāddhas**, but he must continue the evening prayers, the libations of water, purity of life and meditation on the Self. With this summary of the duties of the householder, who voluntarily makes the transit to the next **āśrama** Lakṣmīdhara closes the Gṛhasthakāṇḍa.

EPILOGUE

 So ends Lakṣmīdhara's exposition of the life and duties of the bulk of the population in the most active period of life. His description relates chiefly to the life of the Brāhmaṇa householder, but the application of the rules, as far as may be possible, to the lives of the other **varṇas**, within the bounds prescribed for their activities, is expected. Entry into the last two **āśramas** is purely optional. One may remain in the world and be still out of it. It is expected that one should ordinarily do so. The dvija who has not fully discharged the triple debt vainly seeks final liberation, says [Manu](# "अनधीत्य द्विजो वेदाननुत्पाद्य तथा सुतान् । अनिष्ट्वाचैव यज्ञैश्चमोक्षमिच्छन्व्रजत्यधः॥ (मनु, ६, ३७),")." This is why one is expected to proceed to the last two āśrama only after a full life as a Gṛhastha. The Brahmacārin, who immediately after the completion of his studies takes up the last **āśramas**, is an exceptional person. He is not flying away from the temptations of married life, or fleeing the world in in fear of the wrath to come," like monastics of other religions. He feels he is unfit for married life, or has an aversion for it. To force him to become a Gṛhastha will be wrong. He is therefore allowed to become a **sanyasta**. The spiritual mastery, which he may attain in the last **āśramas**, must balance his by-passing the duty to discharge the triple debt in the married life. Regulated life in the family is by itself sufficient to ensure **mokṣa**. Human duty extends both vertically and laterally in time and in space. Man is a living link between
