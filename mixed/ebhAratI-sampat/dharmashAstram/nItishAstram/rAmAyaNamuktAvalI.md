***AUTHOR'S NOTE.***

   This little book contains almost all the 'Neeti Slokas' or moral sayings culled out from Srimad Valmiki Ramayana, with an English rendering of the same. I need hardly say that even one with the Gandhian command of English language cannot render a happy translation of the Sanskrit verses into English and sometimes a close literal translation, even if it were possible, looks rather uncouth. My present endeavour therefore, is mainly to convey in English the idea. of the original Sanskrit verses, giving a true translation wherever possible and necessary. Like lustrous pearls gathered from the deep ocean these invaluable pearls of Valmiki are collected from out of the unfathomable depths of the vast ocean of Ramayana and hence the book is styled as 'Ramayana Muktavali'. Though this little book may be welcomed by all the English-Sanskrit knowing lovers of Ramayana, it is mainly intended for students whom I request to get the verses by heart with great advantage to them not only during their scholastic career but also in their everyday life thereafter.

Author.

**Respectfully dedicated  
to  
SAGE VALMIKI**

   who, more than the divine hero and heroine of his immortal work, is a source of perennial inspiration to me and to whose silent blessings Ientirely owe my feeble knowledge of Srimad Ramayana.

**“THE HINDU”, MADRAS, SEPTEMBER 29, 1940.  
RAMAYANA SARAVALI**

   This is a collection of interesting essays on different aspects of Srimad Valmiki Ramayana.“The Ramayana”as has been well pointed out by Sri S. Varadachariar, in his short but thoughtful forward to this book, “has for centuries been a source of instruction and inspiration of solace and wisdom to all Hindus.”There have been very many traditional interpretations bringing out the glory of this great epic. There is yet room for further exploration of the wealth and beauties of this unique religious and literary treasure. **Mr, T.Srinivasa Raghavacharya's book is one of the latest attempts to interpret the Ramayana rationally without deviating from the traditional conception of the fundamentals.** His interpretation will have a special appeal for English-educated Hindus.  
   In the second essay on the “Mangala Slokam”Mr. Srinivasa Raghavacharya successfully attempted to justify the first verse of the Ramayana

(Manishadha) and his interpretation of the sloka is that the essence of the seven Kandas is contained in this. In the chapter on the Avathara Rahasyam, the author has referred to the controversy as to whether Sri Rama was a man or an avatar. The traditional view is that while Rama lived and behaved entirely like a man subjecting himself to all the limitations and even exhibiting all human frailties, as does an actor on the stage, he was nonethelessan avatar. This is well brought out in this essay by a reference to some occurences and also to the words of the characters in the poem and of Sri Valmiki himself.  
    The essays on Bharata and Lakshmana, bring out their respective characteristics admirably. There is a chapter dealing with the Pancha Kanyakas. The chapter on 'Rama Shadgunya' deals with the quintessence of the Ramayana and explains the glory of the Rama Avatar. Absolute self-surrender to God or 'Saranagathi' which is considered by many authorities to be the most outstanding teaching of Ramayana, is alluded to and briefly explained.

**RAMAYANA MUKTHAVALI  
BY  
T. Srinivasa Raghavacharya, Chittoor.**

The author of this little book is well-known to numerous audiences at Madras and elsewhere as a learned, **authoritative and original interpreter of the Ramayana**, one of the two great epics of the Hindus. He has already published several special works on the subject, and he has now added to them this volume on the ethical gems, rather, pearls (muktha), found scattered here and there in the different kandas of the Epic. These quota- tions, 340 in the number, show the profundity of Valmiki's wisdom, as well as his deep knowledge of the world. **The verses and sayings are fit to be memorised, particularly by students,** as the author suggests. The learned compiler has translated the same in English so that there might be an intelligent appreciation of the “pearls”.

**T. SRINIVASA RAGHAVACHARYA.**

1\. Forbearance is an ornament to men and woman alike. Forbearance is charity, Forbearance is virtue, Forbearance is sacrifice, Forbearance is fame, Forbearance is righteousness; in fact the entire world rests on forbearance.  
2. It behoves those who are responsible for the protection of the subjects under their care to do all that are needed cruel or not, sinful or blameworthy. This is the Law eternal for those who had taken the reigns of the Government.  
3. The Rakshasas become uncontrollable when twilight sets in.  
4. Youth is ever transcient, the more so among human beings.  
5. Fie on the prowess of the Khshatriyas. The Brahmic might is the real power.

6\. Be more humble and ever control thy passions. Get over the evils resulting from desire and anger.

7\. People are generally fickle-minded.

8\. Human minds are rarely constant.

9\. Awe comes from those who fear.

10\. Even immoveables become attached to us by constant contact with them.

11\. No purpose will be served by constructing a dam after the water had flown out.

12\. Fie upon those who call themselves women, who are ever wily and self-seeking! I don't mean all women, but only those who are akin to Kaikeyi, Bharata's mother.

13\. Truth is the Almighty God resorted to by all; truth is embodied in virtue, in truth converge the everlasting Vedas and it is truth that leads us to Beatitude.

14\. There is no virtue higher than service to one's father and obedience to his commands.

15\. Barren women have an only grievancethat they are childless.

16\. Even a preceptor must be punished, if only he, actuated by pride, acts without discriminating the right from the wrong.

17\. No evil had come unto those who obey the behests of their father.

18\. Virtue reigns supreme in the world. Virtue is entwined with Truth; and to obey the commands of the father is only in consonance with the laws of virtue.

19\. Having once taken a resolve to abide by the words of one's father or mother or even a Brahmin, a virtuous man ought not to go back on the same.

20\. Virtue, material prosperity, and conjugal bliss are but the fruition of leading a truthful life in this world. Even as a devoted wife attains virtue by her devotion to the husband, conjugal bliss by her love and attachment, and material prosperity by bringing forth a worthy son, so, if only we lead a truthful life, there is no gainsaying the fact that Virtue, material prosperity and conjugal bliss will automatically follow.

21\. No action should be done that does not lead to virtue, material prosperity and conjugal bliss. Whatever is done must be in conformity with the laws of virtue, one's endeavour for mere material prosperity makes one an object of redicule, and likewise, one's action done solely for conjugal bliss lowers one's estimation in the eyes of others.

22\. If a preceptor of mature age who is also a king and a father wants to uphold truth by

carrying out his resolve and thereby commands his son to do a certain act, be he actuated by anger, joy or passion, who will transgress his words other than the wicked?

23\. Weal and Woe, Fear and Anger, Profit and Loss, Existence and Non-existence and many other things in the world for which no cause can be attributed are but only the decrees of Providence.

24\. Even the mighty sages of lofty penance have to yield to the dictates of Fate and are decoyed from their life of austerity by words of passions and anger.

25\. Regal splendour and Forest Life are both alike. But if properly understood the latter should be preferred to the former.

26\. It is only the coward and unchivalrous that quietly submit to Fate ! The chivalrous and the self-confident do not depend on Fate.

27\. One who is capable of conquering Fate by his manliness, won't regret, if his actions are thwarted by Fate.

28\. For a (true) wife, the husband is both God and lord alike.

29\. Though a woman may attain a very high position by the observance of fasts and ceremonies, she has only to tread the path of sinners, if she is not devoted to her husband.

30\. A wife devoted to the service of her lord attains the lofty heavenly abode even though she does not adore the Gods and is devoidof other qualities.

31\. A true wife should ever be desirous of serving her husband in all that is conducive to his good and happiness. This is the law Eternal ex-pounded by the Vedas and the Codes of morals.

32\. The ways of Providence in the world are always inscrutable.

33\. Men of power and self-will, will not brook the praise of others.

34\. Those who serve their kings by their industry and good conduct win their smiles and favours; while others become the target of their frowns and anger.

35\. The kings discard even their own kith and kin if the latter act against their interests, and favour only those that are loyal and dexterous even though they belong to the common folk.

36\. Father, Mother, Brother, son and daughter-in-law alike individually attain the fruits of their karma good or bad.

37\. It is the wife alone that partakes of the fruits of the husband's karma.

38\. Neither the father nor the son, nor her own self nor the mother nor the friends is the final

resort of a woman. The husband is her only resort both in this world and the world beyond.

39\. Fear emanates from objects of terror.

40\. A woman who is separated from her husband cannot sustain her life.

41\. The brahmin sages have stated that the Divine Vedas proclaim that she who in this world, is given in marriage to one, by her father and elders with the sprinkling of the holy water in accordance with their religious custom, is his wedded wife even in the world beyond.

42\. Heaven, wealth, agricultural products, knowledge, progeny and happiness are all obtained by mere service to preceptors and there is nothing that cannot be derived from it.

43\. Harmlessness, mercy, culture, good conduct, control of senses and control of mind, these are the ornaments bedecking the person of Rama who is the foremost among all persons.

44\. Rama who is the very essence of virtue, is the resplendant root of the tree of all created humanity whereof all other human beings are but flowers and fruits, leaves and branches.

45\. The unfathomable ocean, the Lord of all the rivers, is never agitated.

46\. It is nobler for a woman to carve to the taste of her husband than carving to the tastes of a crore of her children.

47\. One who fells a (fruit bearing) mango tree by an axe and plant a margosa in its place can not reap a tasty fruit even though he might water it with milk.

48\. It is a well-said proverb in the world that honey cannot be extracted from margosa.

49\. Men possess the traits of their father, and women those of their mother.

50\. If one is attached to the rope after giving up a mighty elephant, of what avail is it to him after the loss of the elephant.

51\. The wife is the soul of all those who lead a wedded life.

52\. However much a loving husband may satisfy the wants of an untrue wife, he is discarded by her in his times of distress.

53\. It is the characteristic of the womenfolk to enjoy in times of prosperity (of their husband) but abuse and even discard him at the slightest advent of adversity.

54\. It is also the characteristic of faithless women to lead a false life, do acts unworthy of them, possess a heart ever unfathomable, be inclined to do sinful acts and in a moment cease to be affectionate.

55\. A woman's affections cannot be won over by nobility of birth, or the help rendered or education or gifts or even the sacred marriage tie, because by nature they are not constant.

56\. For those high-souled women who are truthful, cultured and patient and have a clean conduct there is none more sacred than their husband.

57\. A veena (a musical instrument) without strings and a chariot without wheels are on a par with a woman without a husband who derives no enjoyment even though she might have a hundred sons.

58\. Father, mother, and son all contribute to the happiness of a woman only to a limited extent. Which woman will not worship her husband who unlimitedly contributes to her joy and welfare.

59\. He who seeks after sexual happiness devoid of virtue and material prosperity sinks into the mire like King Dasaratha.

60\. For a woman, the husband is her first resort, the son is the second and the relations are the third but there is no fourth for her in this world.

61\. For those women who lead a life of virtue the husband with or without character is their visible God.

62\. Affliction destroys a man's courage, Affliction destroys his learning, Affliction destroys all that is good in him, in fact there is no greater enemy to him than Affliction.

63\. It is possible to endure a physical blow from the hands of an enemy but it is difficult to bear the pangs of grief however slight they may be.

64\. Even ascetics well-versed in the laws of virtue, cultured and proficient in the Dharma Sastras to the highest degree fall a prey to grief and lose their mental equilibrium.

65\. A man reaps the fruits of his own actions good or bad exactly in the same way in which he had done them.

66\. He who does not foresee, even at the commencement of an action, whether or not it will bear good fruit, or whether his endeavours will be wholly fruitless must be classed only as an urchin.

67\. He who attracted by the deceptive appearance of a Palasa flower, destroys a fruit bearing mango tree and grows in its stead a Palasa plant with the hope of reaping a nice edible fruit repents his folly at the time of fruit bearing.

68\. One who does not realise the consequences of one's own action will repent it even as he who plants the palasa at the time of fruit bearing.

69\. Like rivers without water, jungles without grass, and cows without cowherds a Kingdom is without a King.

70\. Even those lawless miscreants and atheists who are not afraid of punishment from the State, lead a good and contented life after they are sentenced by a Law Court.

71\. As is the Sight to guide the body in the daily avocations of life so is the King to guide the Kingdom in the path of truth and virtue.

72\. For the citizens the true and vituous King is their high birth, the King is the mother, the king is the father and in short the King is their very benefactor.

recede into oblivion as a chain of mountains submerged in the ocean.

149\. Kings are said to be far-sighted because they could easily visualise the distant calamities with the aid of spies.

150\. If a king is ruthless, stingy, indifferent, proud and arrogant, his subjects will not come to his rescue in his times of distress.

270\. It is the characteristic of kinsmen all the worlds over that they ever rejoice at the fall of their own kith and kin.

271\. It is also the characteristic of kinsmen to slander their own leader and advisor, abuse the learned and the righteous-minded and humiliate the chivalrous among them.

272\. Kinsmen are always apparently friendly with a cruel and deceptive heart underneath. In times of trial they shine in their true colours and cut each other's throat.

274\. Fortune in the midst of cows, self-control among brahmins, fickleness in women, and fear in kinsmen may be seen all over.

275\. Friendship with the unworthy cannot be deep-rooted, even as waterdrops do not stick on to a water-fed lotus leaf.

276\. Friendship with the ungrateful does not last a minute even as a drone deserts the flower after extracting the honey therefrom.

281\. Even the strong and the chivalrous and the heroes of the battlefields come to grief when their stars are in the descendent even as causeways of sand (give way to torrents).

282\. One can count upon the support of friends, bill-tribesmen, traditionally loyal military forces and even that of the hirelings but one should scrupulously avoid the proffered help of an enemy.

283\. One should not be wholly guided by the advice of a single friend, good and intelligent though he may be. The advice of other interested friends should also be taken into account in times of stress.

284\. (In times of war) there are deceitful spies roaming about under the guise of guileless persons, watching for the loops-holes of the enemy to enter and cause havoc. This is fraught with grave danger.

285\. The good and bad aspects of a resolution should be carefully discussed before action is taken thereon. If there is a prospect of anything good resulting therefrom, action

might be taken. Else it should be abandoned.

286\. One cannot be entrusted with anything withoutprevious credentials; but one's capacity can be understood without giving one an opportunity to display one's talents. (These two are inter-dependant and hence impracticable.)

287\. It is impossible to fathom the depths of other's hearts. Clever and intelligent questions can not only elicit. Clever and intelligent answers but not with any approach to truth.

292\. Tranquility, patience, straightforwardness, pleasing conversation - these qualities, noble though they may be, are considered as defects by ignoble persons.

293\. One who extolls oneself, a cheat, a merciless man, one who goes to all and sundry, one who shows indiscriminate leniency to all.all these are highly popular among the common folk.

294\. Endurance, pacification and gift are of no avail in dealing with the ungrateful persons. In such cases deterrant punishment alone will bring about the desired results.

295\. A king versed in all the administrative lores, who can intelligently discriminate the right from the wrong, reigns supreme and effectively brings the enemies under his thumb.

296\. A king should wage war with his enemy only when be has a superior military strength; but if his strength is on a par with that of his adversary he should make peace with him.

304\. That king is in keeping with the times who in consultation with his ministers classifies his duties under the three heads (viz:- major, routine, and minor) and discharges them at the appropriate time adopting any or all the five methods.

305\. A King who resolves to do an act in accor-dance with the rules and regulations after consultation with his ministers and friends is considered to be a good administrator.

306\. &307. A King who seeks Dharma, Artha and Kama(Virtue, material wealth and sensual desire) either jointly or severally at the time allotted for each viz., morning, noon and evening is within his limits and will be prosperous. But a king who ignores the best of these three viz., Virtue, and indulges in the last viz., sexual happiness, is good for nothing and all his learning is a huge waste.

308\. Liberal gifts, kind words, separation or aloof-ness, and exhibition of physical strength are the four-foldmeans to be adopted to achieve an object after careful discrimination of time and place.

312\. A king intent on the prosperity of the state should not listen to the unhealthy advice of ministers not versed in the laws of virtue and statecraft, as they would lead him in the mire.

313\. Impudent fellows who give wrong advice under pretext of doing good and thereby bring disaster are to be carefully examined and shunned from the board of advisors.

314\. Wicked ministers often intrigue with the enemies and bring on positive ruin to their masters.

315.Dishonest councillors offering evil advice to their masters under the garb of well-intentioned friends can easily be detected after an intelligent conversation with him.

316\. A king who without any forethought listens to the advice of an incapable and roguish minister only gives a loop-hole to his enemies even as birds find loop-holes in the Krouncha Hills and get their passage through.

317\. He who knows the danger ahead and does not care to be on his guard brings on disastrous consequences and is soon dispossessed of his station in life.

318\. All actions done here, good or bad, lead to heavenly bliss or hellish tortures beyond, though it is equally true that similar actions yield the same resultant benefit in a different form even for the wicked.

319\. The actions that result in Dharma and prosperity and those that bring Adharma and adversity- these four are equally good in their own ways, though at times they fail to produce separate results due to extraneous causes.

320\. People strive to do actions which will bring the desired results here and hereafter. Even those who strive after sensous happiness attain worthy achievements.

*“THE HINDU”*           17-4-40.

     The series of lectures on Valmiki Ramayana delivered by Mr. T. Srinivasa Raghavacharya of Chittoor in the Sri Ramakrishna High School Prayer Hall, Thyagarayanagar, Madras, during the last 10 days was concluded last night with the celebration of Sri Rama Pattabhishekam, under the presidency of the Hon. Mr. Justice K. S. Krishna-swami Iyengar.

   In the course of these lectures, Mr. Acharya gave a full and scientific analysis of the lays of Valmiki, dealing with the forest universities of of ancient India, the social and political organisations of the early Aryans, the reign of Paduka and the principles of Saranagathi and Sanatana Dharma so ably advocated and lived by Sri Rama aud the other great souls that lived with Him and under His guidance. The lecturer vividly brought out the fact that the Ramayana was a galaxy of characters with a rare combination of idealism and realism.

    Mr. Justice Krishnaswami Iyengar said that the Ramayana offered guidance for our daily lives. and expressed appreciation of the lecturer's selfless. task in its propagation.

     Dewan Bahadur K. S. Ramaswami Sastri spoke in high terms of Mr. Srinivasa Raghava-charya's scholarship and erudition and added that every time he heard his discourses, he found the latter expounding some new points and imparting a touch of freshness to them.

     Mr. Justice Krishnaswami Iyengar presented the lecturer with a gold medal, being a gift from those who attended his lectures.

**(Bangalore, 11-4-1937.)**

    An inspiring and erudite discourse on Valmiki Ramayana, with copious references and quotations from Kamba Ramayana, was given by Mr. T. Srinivasa Ragavachariar of Chittoor, at the Sri Anna Vasanthi Sangam Hall, Bangalore Cantonment, this evening. The very large gathering of scholars and devotees, among whom was a sprinkling of ladies, listened with close attention to the discourse.

     This evening's formed the first of a series of ten discourses to be delivered every evening. The speaker explained that the Mangala Sloka in Valmiki Ramayana contained not only the fundamentals of the seven Kandas but also the enunciation of the basic principle of the ultimate union of the jeevathma and the paramathma as dwelt upon in detail in the Mundakopanishad.

      He proved from internal evidence from Valmiki Ramayana that the difference in age between Sri Rama and Sita was only a few months and not several years as is generally believed.

Mr. T. Srinivasa Raghavacharya of Chittoor delivered during the months of June and July a series of lectures on Valmiki Ramayana under the auspices of the Lakshmipuram Association, Madras. Pattabhishekam was celebrated on the 14th instant, Dewan Bahadur K. S. Ramaswami Sastrigal, presiding. The **exposition** of the subject by the lecturer **was of a very high order and brought out very well the beauty, sentiments, and ideas of the poem by Valmiki. Mr. Srinivasa Raghavacharya's mastery of the important portions of the great epic is remarkable and the power of impressive presentation is as remarkable as his memory. He threw additional and valuable light on the much-debated episode about Vali vadam and Vibhishana Saranagathi.** The chair-man complimented the lecturer on his **excellent performance and the public service** done by him by giving a clear presentation of Ramayana, and on behalf of the public **presented** the lecturer with **a gold medal** with the figure of Lakshmi embossed on it, which was the gift of the Association.

    Mr. T. Srinivasa Raghavacharya of Chittoor, delivered this evening the third of the series of discourses on the Ramayana in the Sri Anna Vasanthi Sangam Hall, Bangalore.  
    He described, by reference to quotations from the works of Valmiki and Kamban, the devotion of Lakshmana and Bharatha to Sri Rama. While Lakshmana was an example of absolute and unalloyed devotion to Sri Rama, even at the sacrifice of those dear and near to Sri Rama and himself the devotion of Bharatha was of a different kind.  
  Mr. Acharya brought out vividly, with apttopical references, the principles of Hindu Sana-thana Dharma as preached by Sri Rama and the sages who fill the pages of the Ramayana.  
    The life of Bharatha, he said, was the progress of a human soul stage by stage towards its final union with the Divine Soul or Paramathma.  
     Mr. Acharya then dwelt on the 18 famous verses known as Rama Gita in the Valmiki Ramayana, and explained how those verses were later expounded in greater detail in the 18 chapters of the Bhagavad Gita.  
     The social and political organisation of ancient India as revealed in Valmiki's verses, the benevo-lent autocracy known as Rama Rajyam and the principles of government in ancient India were also expounded.  
  Concluding this evening's discourse, Mr. Acharya said, the Government of Ayodhya with Sri Rama's Padhuka (sandals) as the emblem of sovereignty, was the most unique recorded in the world's history.

    The Ramayana has for centuries been a source of instruction and inspiration, of solace and wisdom to all Hindus. In recent years, the opportunities available even to those who are interested in our religion to understand the true significance and inward meaning of several passages in the Valmiki Ramayana and of some of the incidents described in it have for one reason or another, become more and more limited. It is perhaps natural that expositions of the subject by English- educated Indians should make a more effective appeal to others similarly situated than exposition by our Pandits, in the time-honoured way. At any rate, they serve to create in the English-educated. Hindu an interest and appreciation which may often prove to be the stepping stone to a fuller and deeper study.

    Mr. T. Srinivasa Raghavacharya has for more than a decade been redering a great service by delivering discourses on the Ramayana, in all parts of the Presidency. Their quality is sufficiently attested to by the fact that they have not merely received general public appreciation but also won high encomiums from great scholars like the late-Kapistalam Swami and Sri Jagadguru of the Kamakoti Pita and from leaders of our society like Messrs. V. V. Srinivasa Iyengar and K. S. Rama-swamy Sastri and the late Professors Ramanuja-chariar and Sundara Rama Iyer.  
   May Sri Ramachandra, in His Grace, bless. Mr. Acharya is the humble prayer of.

**(EX HIGH COURT JUDGE)             12th August 1939.**

   Sriman T. Sreenivasa Raghavacharya whom I had known frombhis boyhood has during the last several years blossomed into one of the finest exponents of Ramayana. His art may be accurately described as the art by which he conveys to the hearer or reader his own literary, artistic and critical appreciation of that wonderful epic in all the warmth, the keenness and the joy of his own intimate appreciation.

    He has thus struck a new path of his own and developed, if I may say so, a new criticar art. His is, of course, not the ancient method of reading each stanza and expounding its meaning. Nor is it the art of the Puranist, who sitting in the pial of astreet house makes the text only a pretext for entertaining the audience with something lively and amusing. Nor yet is it the art of the Bhagavathar who merely tells the story in the stereotyped manner in which the main theme is the music and the story or exposition but an accompaniment. In a word, he is himself an artist expounding the art and beauty of the Ramayana.

     As even in all arts the law of demand and supply operates, I can state without hesitation that Sriman Srinivasa Raghavacharya's art is the rare art of the scholar and the critical artist for the delectation of a cultuted audience.

It has not been my good fortune to have had many opportunities of listening to Mr. T. Srinivasa Raghavacharya's discourses on Ramayana. But the few that I have had, have been enough to impress me that Mr. Srinivasa Raghavacharya possesses a**rare combination of knowledge and skill** in handling his subject, not often met with even amongst the professional exponents. **His method of exposition is specially attractive and impressive** and makes a strong appeal to modern minds. He has a **profounded knowledge of traditional interpretations,** but what is noteworthy is that he is able to bring to bear on his discourses a **freshness of outlook,** and an **attractiveness of manner rarely met with** even amongst the professional exponents. One wishes that there were many more of his type to interpret our ancient culture.

 M. R. Ry.,T. Srinivasa Raghavacharya delivered a series of lectures a few days ago here on the Ramayana. His exposition is characterised by an almost uncanny memory, a rare power of bringing out the beauty of sentiments and ideas in Valmiki's inspired poesy, and an admirable ability to supplement Valmiki's thoughts by Kamban's equally sublime poetry. His frequent flashes of humour and irony increase the effect of his delineation of moral and spiritual truths' Mr. Acharya is a great Ramabhakta, a master of the Ramayana and an able lecturer. We were all very much attracted by his learned and lovely presentation of the truths and sentiments contained  
in Valmiki and Kamban. He is yet young and in the height of his powers. I shall be glad to watch his career of social and spiritual service of his country and his community.

   I have listened with considerable pleasure and profit to Mr. T. Srinivasa Raghavacharya's exposition of select topics from the Ramayana. He has a thorough mastery of the grand Epic and is familiar with every detail. His discourses have been lucid and interesting and always held the audience spell-bounded. Not one of them would leave the hall until the Upanyasam was over. His thorough grasp of the philosophy profounded in the great Classic and his wonderful memory which makes him quote without effort are indeed remarkable and praiseworthy.

    Sri T. Srinivasa Raghavacharya gave a series of discourses on Valmiki Ramayana in connection with Sri Rama Navami, at Chingleput, in March 1939 in the Kodanda Ramaswami temple.

  He has a facile and charming method of exposition. The presentation of the story with its settings is simply facinating. It is not the usual pandit style that beats along trodden paths, that refuses to take note of the necessity for a change in social life with the changing of times, and that falls flat upon a discriminating audience. While dealing with particular incidents in the story, he is able to visualise and present them to the audience with a broad outlook, that pictures to us the past. the immediate present, and the possible future of the Hindu society. For doing this, he draws upon immense resources, such as the sentiments ex-pressed in the Ramayana of Kambar and the sayings of Sankara and the Alwars. Here and there, he punctuates the discourses with bits of humour or irony (natural and not artificial), which go to set the story in better and finer relief.

     May he live long and continue to render to the Hindu society the service which he has taken upon himself of social and spiritual regeneration.

In connection with this year's Sri Rama Navami celebration by the local Sri Ramakrishna Samaj, Brahma Sri T. Srinivasa Raghavacharya has been giving an exposition of almost all the chief and significant events in the life of Sri Rama during the last 10 evenings. I have attended all of them with immense pleasure and profit. His reasoned and eloquent expositions have been followed throughout with undiminished interest by all who formed his audience. His knowledge of the great Maharshi's epic is profound, and his numerous and ready quotations were relevant to his exposition of all his chosen themes. Finally, his manner of delivery was effective and clear to a degree rarely to be met with now-a-days and I am glad to be able to say that I fully believe that his explanations and exposition must have a spiritual value for all who care to enter into them with a genuine and sympathetic desire to derive practical and immediate benefit to themselves.

   I had the delight of attending the series of lectures delivered at Nagapatam by Sri Ubha. Ve. T. Srinivasa Raghavacharya of Chittoor covering the entire Srimad Ramayana. His lucid style and mastery of the language, his clear exposition of the 'Thath-warthas' and the 'Goodarthas' of various important passages in the text revealed his extraordinary mastery over the subject. His delineation of the mighty Epic as an exposition of the Great Dharma of 'Saranagathi' was not only interesting but very instructive. The large and varied audience of men, ladies and boys who thronged to hear his lectures and waited till the end each day disclosed how popular and lucid his discourses were. He combines in himself the ancient Pundit and the modern critic, and his quotations from other great works in support of the ideas dealt with in the Ramayana disclosed his wide learning. It is such expositions that appeal to modern India and I am glad he is rendering a very useful and necessary service to the community.

Dear Sir,  
     It was indeed very kind of you to have spent a week with us to the deteriment of your professional work, **a selfless task for the benefit of a man and man's soul.**

     Your exposition of Valmiki Ramayana was not a mere narrative of the story such as would sound stale to a modern audience. It was a quick and exquisite resume of the tale, with an outer garb of erudite commentary-an aesthetic appreciation of situations and sentiments, human and divine enhanced in its merit by the citation of graceful words of eminent religious teachers with supreme relevancy in a manner that was at once impressive aud devotional.

      I wish you will live long and hale, to serve Rama and to make your hearers attain what all the ‘Phalasruti’promises.

Yours sincerely,  
**M. KRISHNAMACHARYA.**

   We, the Public of Negapatam, pay our tribute of praise and admiration to your beautiful and inimitable exposition of the Great Epic Ramayanam.   You have, Sir, in so short a period, indelibly impressed on us the essential truths by your comprehensive and masterly survey of the subject, and your wide study of Sanskrit, Tamil and English has easily earned for you the name of Thribasha Praveena.  
  In token of our humble appreciation of your fine interpretation of Ramayanam, we beg to present this address on the Pattabhisekam day.
