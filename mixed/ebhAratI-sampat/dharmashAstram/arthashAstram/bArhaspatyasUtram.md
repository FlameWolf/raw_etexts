**विश्वानि देव सवितर्दुरितानि परासुव । यद्भद्रं तन्न आसुव \।\।**



**INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.  
1. ANTIQUITY OF ARYAN POLITY.**

 The Arthashâstras have been in existence in Aryâvarta as a separate literature from very early times. The superiority of Dharmashâstras over Arthshâstras is referred to in the Smriti ascribed to *Yâjaaralkya* in the following shloka :—

**स्मृत्योर्विरोधे न्यायस्तु बलवान्व्यवहारतः \।  
अर्थशास्त्रात्तुबलवद्धर्मशास्त्रमिति स्थितिः \।\।२\।२१\।\।**

 The same is said in the *Bhavishya Purâna* as quoted in the Aparârka :—

स्मृत्यर्थेन विरोधे तु अर्थशास्त्रस्यबाधनम् \।\।

* Nârada Smriti* also remarks in the same way :—

धर्मशास्त्रार्थशास्त्राभ्यामविरोधेन यत्नतः ।  
संपश्यमानो निपुणंव्यवहारगतिं नयेत् \।\।  
यत्र विप्रतिपत्तिः स्याद्धर्मशास्त्रार्थशास्त्रयोः ।  
अर्थशास्त्रोक्तमुत्सृज्य धर्मशास्त्रोक्तमाचरेत् \।\।१\।३७।३८॥

 In his well-known Arthashâstra, *Kautilya* (not later than 3rd century B. C.) says that a literature bearing this title was extant in his days, and that he compiled his treatise after seeing the works of his predecessors.  
His words are :-

**पृथिव्या लाभे पालने च यावन्त्यर्थशास्त्राणि पूर्वाचार्यैः  
प्रस्थापितानि प्रायशस्तानि संहृत्यैकमिदमर्थशास्त्रं कृतम् ।**

(Second edition, p.1)

 Not only Kautilya, but also works anterior to him refer to this literature. In *Caranavyûha* the forty-ninth *Parishishta of the Atharvareda* we read:—

**तत्र ऋग्वेदस्यार्थशास्त्रमुपवेदः । ...................................**

**..........................................ब्रह्मवेदस्यायुर्वेदोपवेदः ।**

**अभिचारकार्थशास्त्रमित्युच्यते ॥ ३ ॥**

  This second view that the Arthashâstra is the Upaveda of Rigveda is held in the *Caranavyûha* ascribed to *Shaunaka.*

**वेदानामुपवेदाश्चत्वारो भवन्ति ।........................**

**अथर्ववेदस्य 'अर्थशास्त्रम्' । (चतुर्थः खण्डः ) ।**

   It is clear then that Arthashâstra claims a great antiquity in the history of Sanskrit literature.

II\. BRIHASPATI AND HIS ARTHASHASTRA.

  *Pancatantra (textus simplicior* 12th century A.D. according to Dr. J. Hertel) has a reference to a nîti maxim of Brihaspati.

**सुकृत्यंविष्णुगुप्तस्य मित्राप्तिर्भार्गवस्य च ।**

**बृहस्पतेरविश्वासो [\*](# "Compare with this the teaching of Mahabharata :-  विश्वासयेत्परांश्चैव विश्वसेच्च न कस्यचित् । पुत्रेष्वपि हि राजेन्द्र विश्वासो न प्रशस्यते ॥ अविश्वासो नरेन्द्रणांगुह्यं परममुच्यते ॥ महा० शा० ८५ । ३३।३४॥") नीतिसन्धिस्त्रिधा स्थितः ॥२॥४१॥**

  Bhoja in his *Yuktikalpataru* (I1th century A. D.) while refering to the niti literature says :—

**नीतिर्बृहस्पतिप्रोक्ता तथैवौशनसीपरा । **

**उभयोरविरुद्धात्र निरूप्या नीतिरुत्तमा ॥ p,2.**

 Ashvaghosha in his

*Buddha Carita* (about first century A. D.) has remarked about Brihaspati :—

**यद्राजशास्त्रं भृगुरङ्गिरा वा न चक्रतुर्वंशकरावृषीतौ ।**

**तयोः सुतौ तौ च ससर्जतुस्तात् कालेन शुक्रश्च बृहस्पतिश्च ॥ १॥४६॥**

   The well-known

*Kâmasûtras* of

*Vâtsyâyana* not only refer to Brihaspati as the compiler of an Arthashâstra but state that he lived about the beginning of creation. The whole account runs thus :—

**प्रजापतिर्हिप्रजाः सृष्ट्वा तासां स्थितिनिबन्धनं त्रिवर्गस्य
साधनमध्यायानां शतसहस्रेणाग्रे प्रोवाच ॥५॥**

**तस्यैकदेशिकं मनुः स्वायंभुवो धर्माधिकारिकं पृथक्चकार ॥ ६॥
बृहस्पतिरर्थाधिकारिकम् ॥ ७ ॥**

Bhása also refers to a Bárhaspatya Arthashástra in his

*Pratimá Nâtaka* :—

**रावणः- “... काश्यपगोत्रोऽस्मि साङ्गोपाङ्गं वेदमधीये, मानवीयं धर्मशास्त्रं, माहेश्र्वरं योगशास्त्रं, बार्हस्पत्यमर्थशास्त्रं, मेधातिथेर्न्यायशास्त्रं, प्राचेतसं श्राद्धकल्पं च ।” प्रतिमानाटक p, 79.**

The Mahâbhârata has the following to say on this point :—

        **नीतिं बृहस्पतिप्रोक्तं भ्रातृन्मेऽग्राहयत्पुरा \।
वन० ३२।६१ ॥**

So we know that the Bârhspatya Shâstra claims a great antiquity in the history of Aryan literature.

III\. THE ORIGINAL WORK OF BRIHASPATI.

  The question now arises, as to whether the original work of Brihaspati was composed in verse or sûtras

or in the mixed style. No doubt some sútra líterature along with gâthâ and other works, was extant even before the time of the compilation of the Brâhmanas because the ShatapathaBrâhmana**(सूत्राण्यनुव्याख्यानानि का०१४अ० ७ व्रा० ३ कं०११)**alludes to it, but it is not sure whether it had come into vogue at times as carly as those of Swâyambhava Manu and Brihaspati, the preceptor of Indra.

IV. MANAVA DHARMA SHASTRA.

 Scholars like Max Muller and Buhler held that the Dharmashâstra of Manu was originally a composition in the mixed style of sûtrasand shlokas. Buhler tried his best to put forward this theory with such proofs as he could gather. One of his strongest proofs was a passage
**मानवं सूत्रमुदाहरन्ति** which he found in Vâsishtha Dhaim ashâstra. Now it is sure that the original work of Manuhad passed through the hands of several editors, as for example Bhrigu,Nárada etc., when it reached the compiler of Vâs.Dh. and that a carna of the Krishna Yajur Veda namely the Mânava had also come into existence. It is, thereforer, quite clear that a school of the Mânavas had come into existence even before the 3rd century B. C. The Arthashástra of Kautílya refers to a certain author of this very school. The views of the Mânavas represented in this Arthashástra differ widely from the Smriti of Manu, It is, therefore, evident that the school consisted of authors who differed greatly. It was this great difference which troubled Buhler very much when he could find no reason as to why the teachings of the Smriti differed from the Mânava Grihya Sûtra. The whole of sûtra literature of the Mânava school came into existence after the Mânava carna had been established, and hence

we can safely conclude that the original Smriti of Manu was purely in verse.

  As quoted by Buhler on the authority of Nârada,we know that the original work of Mana began with a verse (shloka, as Nàrada says ). On the other hand all works in sûtra or the mixed style begin almost with a sùtra,

 Again Dhammapada (circa 4th century B.C.) has two verses which are only a Pali version with some change of words of the text of Manu Smriti.





[TABLE]



Kautiliya Arthashástra also as referred to on pages 101-03 and 190 of his "Lectures on the Ancient History of India” by Shri D. R. Bhandarkar has two verses of Manu Smriti with slight changes only.

** संवत्सरेणपतति पतितेन सहाचरन् ।

†



   Here, Professor D. R. Bhandarkar following the lead of Buhler arrives at the result that the verses(above quoted) were not composed by Kautilya but were utilised by him from some work which was in existence long before he wrote or the (metrical) Manu Smriti was compiled.' This is nothing but a prejudice in order to bring down the date of Manusmriti. First a theory is started—Manusmriti is accepted to belong to a later date,–and then if any work anterior to that date is found containing the verses of Manusmriti, (although not mentioning this fact but still indicating that the verses are not his own) it is said that the work in question and the Manusmriti both utilised a material of a very old period. Both this assumption and conclusion do not seem to be convincing.  
   Last of all we may refer to two verses, to be found in the 18th Sarga of Valmiki Ramayana, where the author of that work explicitly says that the following two shlokas were sung by Manu:—

**श्रूयते मनुना गीतो श्लोकौ चारित्र वत्सलौ ।  
गृहीतौ धर्मकुशलैस्तत्तथा चरितं हरे ॥ ३१ ॥**

**राजभिर्धृतदण्डास्तु कृत्वा पापानि मानवाः ।  
निर्मलाः स्वर्गमायान्ति सन्तः सुकृतिनो यथा ॥ ३२ ॥**

**शासनाद्वा विमोक्षाद्वा स्तेनः स्तेयाद्विमुच्यते ।  
राजा त्वशासन्पास्य तदवाप्नोति किल्विषम् \।\। ३३ ॥**

 The verse 32nd is Manusmriti VIII, 38, andverse 33rd is Manu VIII.316.  
 It may, therefore, after this beief discussion be safely concluded that the original Smriti of Manu was like the present one composed in [verse](# " I hope to discuss this subject in detail at some later date.").

V. THE SMRITI OF BRIHASPATI.

 Like its original, the Manusmriti, the Smriti of Brihaspati was also in verse. That work is however lost now (if it may not be unearthed by some future researches). The small collection of some shlokas which is generally called the Brihaspati Smriti is but a child's play as compared with the Bárhaspatya Shástra referred to in the Mahábhárata. Professor Julius Jolly collected fragments of Brihaspatismriti from different law books and and their commentaries, for translating them in the

S. B. E. Vol. XXXIIIBut these fragments are also incomplete. An exhaustive collection of all the sayings of Brihaspati will not be a fruitless task for some future [scholar.](# "After the above lines were written I read in the Vedic Magazine that Pandit Jaideva Vidyalankar of the Gurukul Kangri is busy with this work and will shortly bring out this useful collection.")

VI KAUTILYAAND BRIHASPATI.

 Just as the views attributed to the school of Manu by Kautilya and his follower Kâmandaka are not to be met with in the present law-book of Manu, so also the views ascribed to the school of Brihaspati by Kautilya are not found in the collected fragments of Brihaspati. Brihaspati is referred to on six different occasions by Kautilya. See pages. 6, 29, 63, 177, 192,and 375. *(Text, second edition)*

*——————*

VII.THE BARHASPATYA SUTRAM AND ITS DATE.



The present sûtras even if they do, possess but a very remote connection with the Bárhaspatya shâstra. Even pruned of their sectarian matter, they do not appear to belong to any of the adherents of the original school of Brihaspati. These sūtras may only here and there contain a view of the old Bárhaspatya school.As regards the date of this work, nothing can be said with certainty. The guess of Dr. F. W. Thomas may turn out to be a true one. This much however, is certain that the work is not anterior to the sixth or seventhcentury A. D.\*

-----------------------------------

\* Pandit Jai Deva in the Vedic Magazine already referred to says that the work is posterior to Kalidas, for the reason that in his Meghaduta Kalidas refers to Kankhal alone, while Hardwar or Gangadvara which is a Shaiva tirtha of a recent origin is not at all mentioned by him. This Gangadvara is mentioned in Barhaspatya sutra III. 122. Hence the work is posterior to the recognition of Hardwar as a sacred place.



**VIII. A BARHASPATYA SAMHITA,**  


  There is another treatise connected with the name of Brihaspati. It is the Bârhaspatya Samhitā. We find it often quoted in the गजलक्षण प्रकरण ofलक्षण प्रकाश of वीरमित्रोदय. It is in the form of a dialogue between Nahuśha and Brihaspati. The work is in the mixed style of prose and verse. This Samhitâ also, as is apparent from the numerous quotations in the above mentioned work, bears no connection with thepresent sûtras.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

IX\. WAS BRIHASPATI A CARVAKA. ?

  No doubt, there was a great atheistic logician Brihaspati by name; but was he the writer on polity? Semadeva Suri (10th century A. D.) says in his Yashastilaka बृहस्पतिनीतय इवादेवमातृका (p. 13 Nirnayasagar 1901) and his commentator Shrutasagar Suri says बृहस्पतिनीतय इव । यथा बृहस्पतिनीतयश्चार्वाकशास्त्राणि देवं सर्वज्ञादिविशेषं न मन्यते।So, according to the commentator the Nîtikâra Brihaspati was the renowned Cârvâka. However, all the previous quotations go against this view, Brihaspati the politian, being connected with Manu and others of the theistic school,was certainly a theist, Somadeva and his commentator confuse the two Brihaspatis.

 There have been thus three eminent persons at least known by the name Brihaspati in the literary history of Bhârata. The first and the most well-known was Brihaspati, the writer on polity; secondly Brihaspati, the cârvâka logician, and thirdly the person who wrote the samhitâ.

quoted by Ramchandra Budhendra on **नीतिशतक 31**  
  (Nirnayasagaredition1917 )

 These sûtrās of Brihaspati were originally published in LE MUSEON Troisieme Série-Tome 1. No. 2, 16 Mars 1916. The text printed there, wasin the Roman script. To this, Dr. F. W. Thomas had attached his valuable introduction and translation. By the kind permission of the publishers-The University Press Cambridge-of that journal, through Professor Balkrishna M. A.; the editor of the Vedic Magazine, was able to publish this material in his journal for the month of October 1920. The devanâgari text of the sûträs printed in the Vedic Magazine was prepared by me. During its preparation I was thinking if the text with the introductien and translation of Dr.F.W. Thomas could be preserved in a book form. Even Professor Balkrishna desired the same. This became soon practicable, when the publishers of the present edition undertook this task.

 In the end I should thank my friends Pandits Vishva Bandhu Shâstri M. A. and Nanak Chand B. A. and my pupil Desh Raj for going through the proof-sheets.

**A BRIHASPATI SUTRA.**

 The text here edited with a translation was brought to notice in the course of a search for a celebrated treatise, also ascribed to a Brihaspati, namely the exponent of the Lokâyata or Cârvâka doctrine,the crude corporealism of India. The discovery of this work, to judge from the quotations in the Sarra-darshana-samgraha and elsewhere, would contribute notably to the entertainment of students of Sanskrit literature.  
 The present treatise is not devoid of interest, but the interest is of a different character. The work is in one respect unique, being an exposition of the Science of Royal Policy in Sûtra style. This Indian science may claim no ordinary place in the history of culture,since two of its suceedanea, the policy in fable and the game of chess, still styled the Royal Game, bave made the conquest of the world. In its pure form as a science of monarchical government it does not seem to have passed beyond the Indian sphere, that is the sphere dominated by Indian culture, including Further India, the Malay countries, Central Asia, and Tibet : for,though the Muhammadans have a science of government, which may go back to pre-Islamic Persia, it does not seem to betray an Indian inspiration. And Macchiavelli's Prince, if influenced at all, as is à priori quite conceivable,by oriental models,would derive rather from the Muhammadan than the Indian. The propagation of the policy in fable (the Fables of Pilpay) was first adumbrated by Sir William Jones, in a [sentence\*](# "From the Third Annual Discourse prefixed to his translaton of the Hitopadesha")

which has been expanded by Benfey, with remarkable learning, into an important treatise; just as another sentence from the same eminent scholar developed in the hands of Bopp into the science of Comparative Philology.

  In its technical form the Indian science of polity first became known by the publication of the Kâmand- a'ci-Nitisâra with selections from the commentary (e lited by Râjendralâl Mitra and others in Bibliotheca Indica, 1861-1884). The next stage is represented by two valuable publications of Professor Formichi, a translation of the work of Kâmandaki and a treatise entitled Gli Indiani e la loro Scienza politica (Bologna,1890). In 1908 a notable paper by Professor Hillebrandt drew attention to a number of quotations from a prose work ascribed to Cânakya, also known as Vishnugupta and Kautilya, which was plainly the original authority upon which the later scholastic expositions by Kâmandaki and others were based. Prof. Hillebrandt was unaware at the time that this original treatise had already been discovered in South India, and that the discoverer, Pandit Shania Shastri of Mysore, had published an article dealing with it in the Indian Antiquary (1905, pp. 5 sqq.) and had commenced to issue a translation in the Mysore Review (1906-9, completed in the Indian Antiquary for 1909-10), of which publications notice was taken in Mr Vincent Smith's Early History of India (Oxford, 1907, pp. 134 sqq.)

  The text was edited by Pandit Shama Shastri ( Mysore Government Oriental Library Series: Biblio- theca Sanskrita, No. 37) in 1909, in which year, having

been favoured with a perusal of proof-sheets I was able to draw attention (J. R. A. S. pp. 446-71) to the extreme importance of the work. In 1911-12 Professor Jacobi in two very valuable papers (Kultur-Sprach-und Literaturhistorisches aus dem Kautilya and Uber die Echtheit des Kautiliya in the Berlin Academy Sitzungsberichte, 1911, pp. 954-973, 1912, pp. 832-849) discussed the bearings of the work upon the Indian literary and linguistic history and argued forcibly for its authenticity. We have also to take note of interesting discussions of the work by Prof. Jolly, Lexikalisches aus dem Arthashastra (Indogermanische Forschungen, XXXr., pp. 204-10), Kollektaneen ZUM Kautilya Arthashástra (Z. D. M. G., 1914, pp.345-359), Dr Johannes Hertel, Literarisches aus dem Kautilyashsâtra (Vienna Oriental Journal, xxiv, pp.416-422), and Dr Jarl van Charpentier, En Indisk handbok i statslara fran 300 f. kr. (Nordisktidskrift, 1913, pp. 353-369), Narendra Nath Law, Studies in Ancient Hindu Polity (Based on the Arthashâstra of Kautilya) (vol. I., London, etc., 1914) and a partial commentary compiled by Dr I. Sorabji, as a pupil of Prof. Jolly, and published at Allahabad in 1914. A revised translation by Pandit Shama Shastri is now passing through the press. The information contained in the Arthashâstra is still far from exhausted,and the interest in it may be expected continually to increase.

 As Prof, Jacobi has mentioned, Cânakya frequently quotes his predecessors, both schools and individuals, the style often assuming almost the form of a discussion; and it is clear that in (say) the fifth and fourth centuries B. C. the subject of royal policy was a recognized topic. The schools are the Mânavas, Bârhaspatyas, Aushanasas, AmbhÎyas (no doubt, of Taxila ) and Parâsharas,and the individuals Bhâradvâja, Vishâlâksha, Pishuna, Kaunpadanta, Vatavyâdhi and Bāhudantî-putra. It is, therefore, of interest to find that in the accountof the science occurrig in the Mahâbhârata [(cited by Prof. Jacobi, 1911, p.973)](# "Also cited by Dr G. Oppert in his Weapons, Army Organisation And Political Maxims of the Ancient Hindus, 1880, p 3. B.Datta.") \* some of these names occur. There we are told that the founder of the science wasBrahmâ himself, whose work was abridged by Shiva in a treatise entitled Vaishâlâksha, and then further abridged. in succession by Indra, who compiled the Bâhudantaka, Brihaspati the Barhaspatya, and Kavi ( Ushanas ), the(Aushanasa) treatise-of which the last-mentioned is named alorg with those of Manu, Indra, Bháradvāja, and Gaurashiras in another passage of the same book. (c. 58, 2-3), also in 1. 98, 36 and elsewhere in the literature(e.g.sáma aushanasa in the Janakī harana,x.26).

 To complete this brief sketch we should mention the Shukraniti, no very early work, which has several times (by Oppert at Madras in 1882, by Jivánanda Vidyâsâgara at Calcutta, 1892 etc. etc.) been edited in India and is now accessible in translation (by Prof. Benoy Kumar Sarkar in Sacred Books of the Hin lus Allahabad, 1914 ).

 The Agni-puràna has also a section devoted to the subject, which is, further, fully represented in the Mânara Dharmasástra, as well as in the Mahabharata. We need not mention the later and minor treatises in Sanskrit literature.



 The Niti literature of Burma is of a different) character. In the Tibetan, however, where we find also quasi-independent works on government, there are translations of Sanskrit texts in verse ascribed (1) to Masuraksha and (2) to Nagarjuna. The Javanese has, besides a professed translation of the Kámandaki Nitisára,also some minortracts, perhaps representing the late moral anthology which bears the name of Cânakya.

 If the short text which is here edited were representative of the ancient Bárhaspatya doctrine, it would have a considerable interest. Unfortunately, this is far from being the case. It professes, indeed, like the Brihaspati Smriti, to be dictated to Indra by his Purohita. But what follows is a brief and strangely disjointed exposition of the subject. Its date, as it stands, seems from an apparent mention of the Yâdvas of Devagiri to be brought down at least to the twelfth century A.D. It refers, in passages which, however, may be suspected of interpolation (see notes to II 8–35, III. 8–16, 33–7,119-33), to the sects of the Shaivas, Vaishnavas, and Shâktas and names their sacred domains (kshetras), some of which may not be ancient. It does not seem to contain the matter indicated by the citations in the Arthashâstra of Kautilya (pp. 6, 29, 63, 177, 192 ofthe edition). It displays some grammatical peculiarities, e.g. neuters for masculines (which may sometimes be explained as accusatives obscured by the elliptical sútra style and vice versa), accusative after vi-shvas (which, however, occurs elsewhere), and even the forms samgrahet (which should perhaps be samgrahayet, as, the correct samgrihniyát occurs several times) and diryat

(old subjunctive of dîr; see Lexx.). Finally, it presents some confusions (e.g. I. 36, II, 34, V. 17), probably due to the MSS., and one strange word kusumânta, which, though it can hardly be for Musalmân, might conceivably be a roundabout expression for Pallava (or pall-ava=rita).

 It is not, however, the case that nothing can be said on the other side. Apart from the suspected interpolations, the tone and style, and even the disjointed and miscellaneous character of the work, produce a sense of antiquity it is hard to conceive of such a treatise being deliberately compiled by persons acquainted with the Nîtisâra of Kâmandaki and the Shukraniti. Some of the expressions, e.g. atibhedayet (1. 52), alamkârayet (iv.10), are in the old Arthashâtra style, as are the proverbial expressions (e.g. 1. 29, 100, 11, 11, v. 13, iv. 12). The name Tishya, as applied to the fourth, or Kali, age, recurs in the Mahâbhârata and Harivamsha. A connection with the Bârhaspatyas may be seen in the restriction of the royal sciences to one, namely dandaniti (Arthashâstra,p.6),although they add rârttâ (which again is represented in our text by krishigorakshabânijyâni,II. 4; cf. Arthashâstra, p. 8, krishipàshupàlye búnijyà cavàrttà). The importance attached to the Lokâyta and Bauddha doctrines also points to the same direction. The term Kâpâlika, as applied to adherents of the Kâmashástra, requires explanation; but some Shaiva sects e.g. the Pashupatas encourage erotic ideas.

 Upon the whole we should perhaps not be mistaken in maintaining that the text does, though rather remotely, derive from the ancient Bàrhaspatya system. We might compare it with such treatises as the existent Vedangas,

or with the *Atharvareda Parishishtas,* which contain undoubtedly ancient matter along with strange lexicographical and grammatical features (e.g. *homayet* and even *namaskaret;* see the edition by Negelein and Bolling, Leipzig 1909-10, index). They belong to the backwaters of priestly studies preserved in Southern India, when the general interest was transferred to such subjects as Nyâya, Vedânta, law, and grammar.

   A Ms. of the work seems to be recorded as in private possession in South India (sec Oppert's 'List,' vol. 1. No.4642).[❋](# "There is another Ms. of the work with Shri Pandit T. Ganapati Shastri of Travancore. He writes to me in his letter dated 22nd Dec. 1920 thus--As desired in your letter, I shall arrange on receipt of your printed forms of Bárhaspatya to note down the variants.' These I have not yet received.B.Datta,") This Ms. has not been procurable; but by the kindness of Prof. Rangàcharya, late Curator of the Government Oriental MSS. Library in Madras, I have been favoured with a Devanâgarî copy of another MS.,which is under his charge. Upon this (M) I have based the text, recording the slight variants of the Royal Asiatic Society's Whish Ms. (W—noted in Winternitz's catalogue under No. 160 (3), p. 219). Both originals are in Grantha character, and they derive not remotely from a common source.[¹](# " Whether. this common source was the actual Madras MS,") The punctuation follows almost invariably the Madras copy : the numbering of the *Sûtras* has been added,

  As the treatise is definitely a *Sûtra*, a commentary must have been designed. Does a copy exist, perhaps under Oppert's 1. No. 6061 *Bárhaspatya-sûtra-tíká* (no longer traceable)? It might contain something

interesting, more especially as it is not quite clear that the text, in its six *adhyáyas* is complete2.

I hope shortly to be in possession of a *Niti-sútra* ascribed to Cânakya, [❋](# "This has now been printed as an appendix to the second edition of Kautilya Arthashástra by Pt. Shama Shastri.")  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
or not, I am unable to demonstrate. That it was in the Grantha character is proved by the confusions between *e* and *hi* (v. 15); *०au* and *n* (read as n: III. 118, IV. 38, v. 22); *m* and *h* 1.5,II.8,18, III. 76, 81, 92, v. 11); *k* and *t* (1. 54, 76. III. 81, 92, 131, v.13);*k* and *tt* (III. 122); *g* and *bh* (III. 67); *c* and *v* (III. 26-7) ; *c* and *p* (II. 39); *nc*and *sc* (II. 73,III . 23, 87, 102); *j*. and *bh*(II. 33); *nd* and *ndr* (III. 41); *nd* and *ndh* (II.43); *t* and *m* (v.26); *n* and *r* (I. 7) ; *nu* and *nri* (I.54); *p* and *v* (v. 27); *la* and *li* (II.9) *vra* and *vri* (v 26).

  2. We may here enumerate the chief grammatical peculiarities above referred to. Some of them may be due to the elliptical *Sutra* style, while some masculine plurals in ani from nouns in a may be conjec'ured to be Ms. errors, final n (Grantha, etc.) having been read as ni. Also double gender in such nouns is common :

  (a) neuter for masc. :

  *abhiprayam* (v. 9); *artham* ? (VI. 9); *asarani* (III. 57); *upayani* (IV.. 43); *kalaham* iv. 36j; *kamum*? (II. 47); *devalayani* (III. 56); *dharmam* ? (II. 46); *pratikoram* (IV. 50); *mantrani* (III..8, elsewhere masc. : different sense ?); *moksham*? II. 48); *lobham* (1.22) *vadham* (11.49); shabdam (1v.33, known el ewhere); *svaram* (1v. 17); *vishaya* (111. 113 ?).

  (b) compounds with adi in various genders, having no obvious concord : I. 12, 57, 64, 65, 106; II. 16, 19 ; III. 15.

  (c) masc for neuter :  
*aushadhah* (III. 139); *kshetsah* (III. 119-122; also neut.); *phabah*. (III. 73); see also III. 9.

  (d) *arj*-for *arj* : 11. 7, 9, 13.

 (e) *suparihritya* (v. 15) ard *divyat* (111. 46, 47) are archaic.As regards Sandhi, I have usually normalized, sometimes leavingh in pause, where it is legitímate.

**BRIHASPATI SÛTRA**

Now the*Brihaspati sûtra,*

Now the Brihaspati,

❋

the Preceptor, expounds to India the Whole Substance of Policy :

I (PERSONAL CONDUCT)

1\. Self-mastery is the quality of a king.

2.As minister he should appoint one master of himself.

3.His sole science is the Administration of Punishment \[=
Government\].

4.Even right he should not practise when disapproved by the world.

5.Should he practise it, it should be after recommending it by
persons of intelligence,

6.He is to be served by his like.

7.With women, children or the aged, he should not discuss measures of right and policy,

8.He should not engage in magic shows \[*indrajâla*\];

9\. In incantations \[*mantras*\], however, and festivities;

10.Also in counteracting diseases and poisonings,

11.Not smearing with ashes \[like an ascetic\].

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3.On the question of the king's sciences see*Arthashastra*, c. 1.

6\. On this question of choice of ministers etc. see*Arthashastra*, cc. 4-5; also 80infra.

10\. On poison in the palace see *Arthashastra*, c. 17.

12\. Also not sacrifice \[*agnihotra*\], Veda-reading,and so forth.

13\. Not processions to sacred places.

14\. Also not service of a king.

15\. Nor service of women.

16\. He should not drink intoxicants.

17\. Nor slay a Brâhman.

18\. Nor practise theft.

19\. Nor much indulge in garlands and unguents.

20\. He should not be dejected.

21.Nor over-wrathful.

22\. What is called non-giving is greed on a wrong occasion.

23\. In a (true) field he should have seed sown.

24\. Giving should be practised.

25\. Aversion therefrom is greed.

26.Theft is also greed.

27.Pleasure is a cause of expenditure of means.

28\. A will to hurt gurus, gods, wise men, kings, and so forth is anger,

29.And it is a smiting of one's own head.

30\. An enemy equal in forces and so forth he should slay in war;

31\. Other adversaries \[or If attacking others, then\] by conciliation, gifts,dissension, pretended ignoring, and so on.

32\. He should not have sordid dress.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

     22. Text and translation uncertain. More intelligiblewould be *avishaye d.nam...*'giving on a wrong occasion is called non-giving.'  
          31. I translate *anyabhiyodhinah.*  
          32. Sc. he should never be in deshabille.

  33. And he should not practise over-indulgence in hunting.

  34. From over attachment to women ill-repute grows;

  35. And vitality wastes.

 36. In association with those guilty of gaming,provoking others, abusing others, the weaknesses of others (are exposed) along with the words of *mantras* in learned or frivolous play (?).

 37. Taking of medicine, evacuation of urine and faeces, bathing, teeth-cleaning, enjoyment of copulation, worship of divinities,-these also are to be done in private.

  38. A sham professor of virtue he should not trust;

  39. Nor censure either.

  40. Nor upon seeing mad or stupid persons, and so forth, should he laugh at them.

  41. His sport in private should be with those of like character and age.

 42. Elephant and horse sports in public; not with creatures of two (different) kinds.

 43. And he should not harm living beings of his own kind.

 44.Desire should be felt for superiority to prede-\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

   36.Rendering conjectural. Are the *mantras* quasi oaths ?

  40. So also in the *Shukra-niti* III. 230 The miserable, the blind, the dwarf, and the dumb are never to be laughed at.'

  42. Contests of dissimilar animals are here, it seems, denounced. Or we might take *rahasye* from 41 and, reading *tadvimurtam,* render 'Elephant and horse sports in private; in public those with other species.' This is less likely.

cessors and successors in respect of wealth, popularity, robility, and magnanimity.

 45. Traditional right, goodwill of dependents, and councillors, relatives, friends, kinsmen, he should all alike consider;

 46. In respect of dependents, punishment and largesse, within and without;

 47. In respect of councillors, conciliation, disse-nsion, and largesse;

 48. In respect of relatives, allotments of income for the sake of conciliation, dissension, largesse.

 49. To even an unwelcome speech he should listen.

 50. In bad weather, when the planets are hostile, at the *nakshatra* of three birthdays, and when serious business presents itself he should not attend to festivities.

 51.He should attacks to himself a wife of the same country, of the same form, and of noble birth.

 52. He should cause especially dissensions (among the wives); excessive conciliation, excessive largesse are not to be practised, nor punishment to be used towards women, nor pretended inobservance.

 53. Among them he should not say much.

54\. Among village petitioners, panegyrists, bards, minstrels, actors, dancing-women, instructors, liars, boys, pimps, traders, herdsmen, harlots, mean kings, he is to be addressed in pompous untruths.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 46.Within and without' : sc. the capital.  
 50. Three birthdays' : perhaps his own, that of his father, and that of his grandfather.  
 51. Of the same form' *(ekarupini)* perhaps 'of the same caste' *(ekararna)*.

 55. Association with kings, harlots, soothsayers, and dependents he should not indulge in long.

 56. He should frequent one whose superiority is in himself;

 57. Prospects and so forth \[he should regard\] not overmuch,

 58. Those attached to women, gambling, drinking he should not have in his service.

 59. During five *nâdikâs* prayer to the divinity of his choice; that passed, the audience;

 60. During ten *nâdikâs* administration of justice; during five *nâdikàs* the bath;

 61. During three *nâdikás* the repast;

 62. During five *nâdikás* amusement and play with dear ones;

 63. During two *nâdikás* twilight worship;

 64. During seven nâdikâs nautch and so forth;

 65. During seven *nâdikás* sexual intercourse, repast, and so forth;

 66. During seven *nâdikás* sleep.

67\. He should rule himself without failure of vigilance;

68\. Like the driver of a horse.

69\. High Brâhmans \[he should greet\] with a shake of his head, welcome and giving of leavings and betel;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

56\. Or his own lord.'

39-66. On the disposition of a king's time see Arthashestra, c. 16, and Prof. Formichi, *Gli Indiani* &c., pp 66 sqq. A *nadika= ½muhurta* = 24 minutes.  
68. 'Shaking of the head' ; on this as a sign of approval see the passages quoted by me in *Kovindravoonamuccaya*  
ad v. I.

 70. A mean Brâhman not with a shake of the head, even if he brings a present;

 71. A like prince or emperor with welcome, with a seat, with a shake of the head, with gift of betel and with jocular talk;

 72. Men of the three castes with a smile, with welcome, and audience (?);

 73. Shûdras not with a glance or smile nor with welcome;

 74. Children, the aged, and so forth, with giving of something which they like;

 75. Low-caste \[ Foreign ?\] people and heretics not even with an utterance.

 76. Owing to importance of business he may have recourse to them;

 77. Let him say little, however, and assign theemployment.

 78. Let him not accept fine gold \[ or receive men of the (3) castes\] in private.

 79. With workmen, even in his employ, let him not deliberate upon the task.

80. With his friends let him choose a like friend as councillor;

 81. But if low-born, he must be one having not low-born caste.

 82. Low-born persons have the characteristic of not mentioning their own objects and of executing orders.

 83. So he should not over-cherish them

 84. Nor again should he trust them.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

72\. Audience':Itranslate *asthanena*, but the text is corrupt.

78\. *Varnika-parigraha*: Read *varnika-parigraha* ?

79\. 'Even in his employ' : so translate *yoginah* ?

  85 Knowing all, he need not act.

 86 Secrecy in regard to right, secrecy in regard to home and going abroad, secrecy in regard to measures, secrecy in regard to enmities; in failure of prestige he should deny even the truth.

  87 Physicians, astrologers, soothsayers he should entertain, if possessed of conduct and character.

  88 Even the truth,if causing grief or misfortune, he should not speak.

  89 Up to twenty-five years he should passionately practise the study of sport.

  90 Thenceforward acquisition of wealth.

  91He should keep himself free from indebtedness.

  92 Indebted he becomes by three means, pleasure, anger, and greed.

  93And he should continually guard his person.

  94 He should not neglect the regular rites.

  95 If there is a popular clamour, he may omit a minor rite.

  96 Upon a lost cause let him not stand;

  97Far to be avoided then is even a serious matter of sovereignty.

  98 He should not favour new commanders who are *Kusumântas.*

  99 A slight loss is to be borne.

  100 As with familes of elephants, bandits, noxious serpents, and tigers living in forest or cemetery among

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  98 *Kusumântes* : this word, which recurs in *sutra* 105, is quito mysterious ( ? = *Pallava*, or *pallava*, ie *vita* ?).

 99 The meaning seems to be that a commander should not be dismissed for a slight failure.

 100 The idoa: seems to be that of the nursery rhyme

those who in comparison therewith are inoffensivefeuds of kinsmen are not to be engaged in.

 101 Like dogs with one piece of fiesh is that estate of sovereignty, when the sovereignty is in trouble.

 102 Policy truly is like a tree on a river's bank.

 103 So he is not to desire \[ it \]

 104 *Kusumântas* and so forth are inimical to all creatures.

 105 Prestige, vigour, vitality, greatness-these are destroyed by excessive cultivation of *Kusumântas.*

 106 Desire, anger, conceit, jealousy, hypocricy, and so forth he should not encourage.

 107 An enemy of good character is a friend.

 108 Among friendsone of good character is an enemy.

 109 Between moon and sun there is hostility by reason of their common brightness (tastes):

 110 Were it not so, they would both stand fast.

 111 Where there is feud among relatives, those two families perish to the root.

112 Whoso abandons the science of awarding punishment, helpless he like a moth enters the flame all unwittingly.

 So speaks the holy Preceptor, garu of the chief of the Gods,

 So in the Brihaspati Sutra the First Chapter.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 'Let dogs delight &c.'. With the reading kule we should render 'he dwells as it were in a family...

 101 *Shuna* dog' probably mean; more exactly ‛pack of dogs' : cf. a *shua* and Panini Iv. 2. 48,

 103, 110 We might translate 'If between sun and moon there were hostility ..., they would not continue".



II (DUTIES AND PRINCIPLES)

 1 Sovereignty belongs to one possessing advantages.

 2 There is advantage of knowledge, advantageof wealth, and advantage of comrades:

 3 Gratification of his own family also and protection of usage;

 4 Agriculture, cattle-rearing, trade.

 5 Universally the Lokâyata system of doctrine is alone to be followed at the time of acquiring gain;

 6 Only the Kâpâlika as regards attainment of pleasure;

 7 The Ârhata in regard to right,

 8 The Lokâyata is not really profitable (?); the advantage quickly perishes.

 9 So the Kâpâlika, the Ârhata, and the Bauddha.

 10 On these relying, he is like the moth and the fire.

 11 The fruits are like ear-water \[or water in the ear?\].

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 1 Guna is here used in an untechnical sense ('strongpoint').

 4 The Arthashastra mentions (c. 1) the same three matters (*krishi*, *pashupalya*, and *banijya*) as the components of *vartte*, or business, one of the studies of a king.

 5 The Lokayata doctrine, along with *Sankhya* and *Yoga*, makes up the triad of philosophy in the Arthashastra ( c. 1).

 6 Elsewhere the Kapalikas are a Shaiva sect: see the St Petersburg lexicon and reff.

 8-35 These Sutras, which seem at variance with the preceding, and which betray a strong sectarian bias, may be suspected of being an interpolation. No, 36 joins on well to No.7.

 11 ‛Ear-water’is this a synonym of 'sky-flower, &c.='nonentity' ? or 'water in the ear' (sc. not in the mouth or only heard of) ?

 12 When one characterized by ignorance desires in a matter connected with right to effect a human object, then he is a heretic entitled Laukâyatika.

 13 When a Candâla is desirous of enjoying fine drink, fiesh, and so forth, then he is a heretic entitled Kâpâlika.

 14 When abandoning twilight worship and so forth, sacrifice and so forth, he desires the duty of non- killing, then he is a Kshapanaka heretic.

 15 When, abandoning the rites described in the Veda,and knowledge of them, also Shiva, the Lord of All, Vishnu, and Shri, a man declares that all is void, then he is a heretic entitled Bauddha.

 16 When he declares right to be vain, a means to gain, he is a Laukâyatika; and he declares that the *pinda* and so on are theft.

 17 He does all for profit,-sacrifice, twilight prayer, and so forth.

 18 To conceal his failing, one afflicted with desire studies the Veda;

 19 He performs sacrifices and so forth:

 20 He does it with a view to drinking wine, with a view to intercourse with women.

 21 He says Vishnu and the others are wine-drinkers so the Kâpâlika.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 14 *Kshapanaka*: = Jaina.

 15 'Knowledge': read *karmajatam* 'mass of rites'?

 16 Pinda: the reference seems to be to the food offered to the dead: the custom was rídículed by the followers of Brihaspati, as appears from the Carvaka, or Lokayata, chapter in the *Sarva*-*darshana*-*samgraha*.

 22 The Kshapanaka, aiming at right, speaks of right as depending on the bearing of rags and broom:

 23 He speaks of Shiva and so on,—so the Kshapanaka.

 24 With a view to abuse of others he studies Veda, *Shâstra*, right and so forth;

 25He reproaches all;

 26 Even Maheshvara, Vishnu and so forth;

 27 He slso speaks of right with a view to eating,

 28 For the sake of discussion he praises others—this is the Bauddha.

 29 The Laukâyatika, when dead, is a denizen of hell, extern to profit, pleasure, right, and liberaton.

 30 And the same applies to his family; that family perishes within the period of sons and grandsons.

 31 The Kâpâlî,abandoned by his village, household, and relatives, becomes a denizen of hell, denounced by all people :

 32 And at that very time his family perishes.

 33 The Kshapanaka is denounced by his family, and those who live in the village, and three families perish.

 34 The Bauddha becomes a very detested denizen of hell; and his existing family perishes, or in the time of sons and grandsons.

 35 Connection with heretics of this sort he should not have, even in thought.

 36 Even by one whose counsels are well ordered,

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 22 The "broom" is the brush of twigs which the Jain ascetics carry in order to brush away insects.

 34 The Sanskrit sentence is here confused: but the meaning is clear.

 36 \[ Not \]: we may, if we profer, read *adharmikena*. This Sutra connects well with No. 7.

who discerns the weak points of others,and who is \[not ?\] a man of virtue, sovereignty cannot be preserved.

 37 One infatuated with the conceit of power, filled with greed and pride, loses what has been acquired.

 38 Whoso, after reflecting upon his measures.enjoys himself, he achieves the highest success.

 39 He must so do that by his action he is not known by the world as 'knowing what to do, bent upon profit,' or as a man of righteousness':

 40 Like Ishvara, like Moon and Sun.

 41 Counsel is the action of effecting unity of opinion on the part of persons conforming to a master's mind.

 42 A councillor must speak of measures, regardless of his master's preference.

 43 The fruit of policy is attainment of right, advantage, and plesure.

 44 Pleasure and advantage are to be tested by right;

 45 Right by right;

 46 Advantage by advantage;

 47 Pleasure by pleasure ;

 48 Liberation of the soul by liberation.

 49 Injunction of a guru is to be executed, even when at variance with right, as the marriage of the Pândavas, Arjuna's asceticism, Vyâsa's intercourse with a widow, the begetting of Karna, Râma's punishment. of a mother and so on.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 40^(')Like Ishvara': his motives must be inscrutable.

 49 The references are to well-known stories in the *Mahabharata*.

 50 Even a son, at variance with policy, is an enemy.

 51The young, the vicious, reckless, unacquainted with *shâstras*, he should not admit to counsel.

 52 Dull-witted, immoral, violent, thoughtless, irascible, foolish young men are not to be employed in counsel.

53 Let all jewels even be given to preserve one's own purpose, life, and prestige.

54 During counsel he should not not evoke anger.

55Right is the main factor; not personal objects,

56 Happiness unrighteously enjoyed is no friend.

57 Maintenance of position is \[ or and \] enhancement.

58 Like one who eats what is not wholesome butis on good terms with \[ or as taking a precaution against, *Pratikára* \] death,

 A man true to his word, relying upon the *Shâstras*,  
might even dry the ocean.

 59 If he is angry \[ his dependents \] become discouraged and timid.

60 One bad man ruins many.

61 Fate depends upon manhood.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 51We translate *mantre* na *praveshayet*.

 53 The 'jewels' are the various treasures' of a king, his wife, minister, general and so forth.

 57 I tranalate *sthitir* *vardhanam* : reading *sthstivardhanam*, we might render ' \[ he should aim at \] enhancement of his actual position' or '...conservation and enhancement.'

 58 The idea may be that of fortifying oneself sgainst poison.

 61 A common sentiment : ef. *Shukra*-*niti*, 1.95-6

 62 Whoso loves his own wife and in taming him-self has capacity, is without equal.

 63A good man turns not aside through fear.

 64 What at that time is proper is not to be spoken by friends not conversant with matters of speech.

 65 One of arrogant heart, lost to respect for right, not self-controlled, he could not admonish.

 66 when exhausted with frightful acts, sunk in the sleep of ignorance, he should enlighten the fool with the cool airs of righteous speeches.

 67 Among bad men a good man shines forth like the sun.

68 Those committed to unrighteousness he should check by proper conduct.

 69 In unrighteousness he should not involve himself.

 70 In ill-repute he should not involve himself.

 71 He should not slay.

72 Let a fool be restrained, like an elephant, with the hook of righteous reading.

 73 A guru's word is not to be transgressed, if in accordance with reason.

 74 Even a guru, if not equipped with policy, he should disregard.

 75 A guru says it.

 So in the *Brihaspati* *Sûtra* the Second Chapter.

                     **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**



III (VIDYÁ).

     

1Manliness is the quality of one superior to weakness.

 2 One becomes superior to weakness by residence in other countries.

3 Of all powers, times, countries, conciliations, natures, strengths, exercises, ages knowledge is to be acquired :

 4 Also endurance of fasting and so forth.

 5 He should make treasures with fragrances and robes.

 6 A long conversation he should hold only if a gracious one.

 7All his like-minded ^(')jewels' he should ever seek to please.

 8 He should know new mantras :

9 These are threefold : Shâkta, Vaishnava, Shaiva and their further divisions.

 10 Entrance to the city of Liberation is by three:

 11 Shâkta, Vaishnava, Shaiva.

 12 The Shâkta is like a journey in a vessel;

 13 The Vaishnava like a high road;

 14 That which believes in *Kerala* and *Pradhâna* is like a horse chariot;

15 The Laukâyatıka, Kshapanaka, Bauddha and so forth are like a cavernous route through a desolate forest swarming with many tigers and malignant beasts.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
  9-16 Again apparently a sectarian inserton:  
   cf. ad II. 8, III. 33.

 14 This is the Shaiva system : see *Sartadarshana* *samgraha*, c.VI.

 16 Having marked this, let him have recourse to one.

 17 Let him ever mark the aspect of the lord of lights ( the moon ? ).

 18 And let him defend the order of four castes.

 19 And let him make use of medicines ;

 20 These which fortify strength, complexion, energy, self-esteem, intelligence, courage, compassion, and reduce the faulty humours.

 21Let him procure success by gifts, honours, ornaments, and sciences.

 22 Let him watch the eighteen *Tirthas*.

 23 *Tirthas* are the six constituents of royalty, also enemy, friend, and neutral:

 24 Also intestine enemy, intestine friend, intestine neutral; and these are dependents, companions, and friends.

 25 Also wives, sons, and kinsmen.

 26 Others also \[ to be watched \] are temples, places for dances and.

27 sacrifices, twilight, pools, cross-roads, heretic abodes, shops, schools for the young, parade-grounds, fields, new-moon etc, festivals, harlots' houses, the seashore, presence of ascetics, frontiers, places for sale of liquor, serais for travellers.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 22 *Tirtha*: a technical terin in the Science of Policy for the important personalities in the kingdom. The use is some-what peculiar in 23.

 23 The constituents ( *prakriti* ), as usually enumerated, are king, minister, country, fortress, treasury, army, and friend: see *Arthashastra*, c. 95, and Formichi, op. cit, p. 92.

 27'Twilight-pools' would be places for performing twilight worship.

28 Let him have festive attire.

29 At the city gate let there be a general stoppage.

30 However, let him not exclude all.

31 Let him honour Itihâsas and Purânas;

32And expositions thereof:

33And the Shâkta scriptures:

34And the Vaikhânasa scriptures;

35 And the Sânkhya;

36And the Shaira.

37 As regards all these, let him perform and require the due study.

38 A Brâhman let him not slay, even if infected with faults.

39 To the unmerciful \[no\] mercy should be shown,

40 Let him show respect to village headmen ;

41 Also to city magnates.

42 Let him conciliate even the weak,

43 By largesse much :

44Not also with little.

45 In the case of excellent persons not in the order of the plenitude of their merits.

46 Let him play with dice:

47Also \[ Or \] let him not play at all.

48Serpents and so forth let him slay.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
32 ‛Expositions’ : The word paka would seem to be a synonym for pakti in janapakti, lokpakti 'teaching the people' see Shatapatha-Brahmana XI. 5. 7. 1.

33-7 These sutras are perhaps again an insertion : SeeIntroduction and ad II. 8, III. 9.

39 Or "no mercy (adaya).

49 High Brâbmans, perfected by various mantras and rich i knowledge, let him honour.

50 Brâhmans of other countries, Kshatriyas,princes, feudatories, and so forth let him welcome as if they were himself with viands, clothing, and so forth.

51 A refugee, though qualified by all crimes, let him protect.

52 Let him check the bad;

53 And protect the learned.

54 Let him not oppress a village :

55 Or a city :

56 Or temples.

57 Let him make use of fermented liquors;

58 Not in excess, however,

59 Also flesh food.

60 Compassion to life must be shown :

61 The Bauddha way and so forth not.

62 Nor as regards imperceptible (creatures).

63 Gay ladies are to be used.

64 The earth has a measure of fifty krores of yojanas.

65 And it has seven contínents.

66And is girt with seven seas.

67 Karma, Bhoga, Atibhoga, Divya, Shringâra,

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  

61 The Buddhists and Jains especially denounce killing in sacrifice.

62 ‛Imperceptible' apparently a reference to the Jaíns preeautions against killing small creatures.

67 These names, as applied to the seven duipas, do nct seem to occur clsewhore but Bharata Versha is karma-bhumi inthe Vishnu-purana, II. 3. 2.

Siddha and Kaivalya are the designations of the continents.

63 The midmost is the Land of Action (Karma).

69 What is in the middle thereof, as far as the Jambu tree, belongs to Meru.

70 Therein to the north is Himvat.

71 On the south of that is land of nine thousand (yojanas).

72 Therein to the south is Bhârta Khanda.

73 There the fruits of righteousness and unrighteousness have their visible effect.

74 In relation therto is the administration of punishment.

75 It is to be studied by the people of Bhârata, past, future, and present and by men of the four castes.

76 By administration of punishment the holy Sun is king :

77 And Wind and all the gods :

78 And mortal creatures.

79 From Badarikâ to \[Râma's\] Bridge is a distance of one thousand yojanas.

80 From Dvârká as far as Purushottama and the

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

70 'On the north': This cannot mean on the north of Meru or of Jambudvipa, which would be contrary to the ordinany view:it must, therefore, mean 'starting with the north' of India.

71 Nine thousand' : The usual ostimate, as in the Vishnu-Purana II. 3. 2.

79 'One thousand': The same estimate is given by the Vayu-Purana: see Wilson's note in Vishnu-P. (ed Hall,II.p.127),

80 The Purushottama-leshetra is in Orissa, and the

Shâlagrâma is a distance of seven hundred yojanas.

81 In this area also are the seven Great Mountains, Raîvataka, Vindhya, Sahya, Kumâra, Malaya, Shrîparvata, Pâriyâtra.

82 And the Great Rivers, Gangá, Sarasvati, Kâlindî, Godâvari, Káveri, Támraparnî, Ghritamálá.

83 And eighteen countries.

84 Eighteer are the maritime kings:

85 And eighteen the hill kings.

86 The creation of Ráma consists of one hundred and forty (yojanas ?) on the south and north, as far as the Sahya twelve; that of Vishvâmitra eleven,

87 Nepal one hundred and four.

88 On the shore of the castern sea :

From Varuna to the sea is a space of eight yojanas.

shalagrama-ksh, is supposed to be on the river Gandak: see Wilson's Vishnu-P.(index).

82 ‛Great Rivers' : The word hula-nadi does not seem to occur elsewhere. On the various lists of the chief rivers see. Wilson's note, Yishnu-P. II pp. 131-2. The Ghritamala is,doubtless, Wilson's Kritamala.

86 'The Creation of Rama' and 'the Creation of Vishvamitra': The Epic story of Vishvamitra's attempt at a rival creation is well known; but the phrase Vishvamitra-srishti does not seem to occur in the literature. In the tradition of the pandits the idea is quite familiar, Vishvamitra being credited (like Ahriman among the Iranians) with the authorship of all faulty or misshapen and misbegotten things, such as the mirage. The application of the numbers in this sutra is obscure. Is 'as far as the Sahya' = 'in breadth' ?

88 The site of the Varuna-tirtha does not appear to be known.

89 Each one hundred and five are northern Láta, And eastern Lâta.

90 Kâshîand the Pâncâla country are together eighty;

91Kekaya and Srinjaya are sixty;

92 The Matsya and Magadha country one hundred;

93Màlava and Shakunta eighty;

94Kosala and Avanti sixty;

95Saihya and Vidarbha together two hundred;

96Videha and the Kuru country one hundred ;

97 Kàmboja and Dash árna eighty.

98 These are the great countries.

99These indeed are four-cornered.

100 The Âratta and Bâhlika country are from south to north one hun lred, from east to west twelve.

101 The Shaka and Suráshtra country are fourcornered and of forty.

102 Anga, Vanga, and Kalinga are of one handred and four-cornered.

103 KashmÎr, the Huna and Ambashtha countries, and Sindh are of one hundred and four-cornered.

104 The Kirâta, Sauvîra, Cola, and Pândya countries, situated on north and south are of one hundred increased by sixty.

93 Shakunta is not elsewhere known as name of a country or people.

103 The Hunas are, doubtless, those of Hundesh.

105 The Yâdava country and Kânci are of one hundred and forty.

106 These are minor countries.

107The seven Konkans are of one hundred and four, and the...

108 These are on the water.

109 On mount Sahaya are four hill countries;

110 On Shrîparvata two;

111 On Raivataka one;

112 On the Vindhya five;

113 On Kumâra one;

114 On Mahendra three;

115 On Pâriyâtra three.

116 All are equal, from south to north of fifty, from east to west of five yojanas.

117 In the Mleccha rmgion are Yavana countries, mountainous.

118 The countries are adorned with villages, cities, gardens, and so forth, and with holy domains and so forth.

119 Eight are the Vaishnava domains;

120 Badarikâ, Shâlgrâma, Purushottama, Dvâraka, Bilvâcala, Ananta, Simha, Shrîranga,

121 Eight the Shaiva;

122 Avimuktaka, Gangâ-dvâra, Shiva-kshetra,

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

105Yadavas: Perhaps those of Devagiri.

107 For the 'seven' Konkans, see Wilson's Vishnu purana (ed. Hall II. p. 178, n. 14).

119- 127 Again an insertion ?

120 Bilvacala......Simha : Perhaps the Bilvadri and Simbacala of which mahatmyas exist.

Rame-Yamunâ (?), Shiva-sarasvati, Mavya, Shárdūla, and Gaja kshetras.

123 The Shákta are also eight;

124 Oghghîna Jàla, Púrna, Káma, Kolla, Shrishaila, Kánci, Mahendra.

125 These are the great domains ;

126 And effective of all attainment;

127 Also ineffective \[ or to be worshipped\]

128 On the Vindhya dwells perpetually Durgá, and Bhadrakálî ;

129 On Kumára Kumára dwells perpetually;

130 On Sahya Ganapati;

131 On Raivataka the Teacher;

132 On Mahendra Garuda ;

133 On Páriyátra Kshetrapála.

134 In the Land of Action, wich is Bhárata, the gods are many times as numerous as the men.

135 Gods, Demons, Yakshas, Rákshasas, Bhútas, Pretas, Vináyakas, Kūshmándas, those with distorted features:

136 What they carry and their dress are determinate :

137 Friendly or Terrifying, *Yoginis* and *Nâgas*; they, assuming forms at will, consort in countless numbers with mankind.

138 And by men they may be protected.

139 In that \[ Bhárata country \] are ambrosial herbs,

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

122 Avimuktaka: Benares.

124 Oghghin : Ujjain ?

131 The Teacher: Brihaspati.

133 Kshetrapala :Shiva.

140 At this point the number of the ages, the *Kritâ, Treta. Drâpara*, and *Tishya.*

141 In the *Krita* \[ the creatures are \] possessed of knowledge;

142 And versed in the administration of punishment;

143 In the *Tretâ* they are active and skilled in policy:

144 In the *Drápara* they are folllowers of *Tântrikas* and of strong tastes;

145 And versed in policy :

146 In the *Tishya* quarter men are strong in knowledge and action, and versed in the administration of punishment :

147 After that they are of diverse rightfulness, colour, and dress, and void of the administration of punishment.

148 And the peoples behold, intent upon false speaking. Thus says the Preceptor.

 So in the *Brihaspati Sútra* the third chapter,

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

140 The Mahabharata also names the Tishya asthe fourth age

IV (Omens and Counsel)

1At the Brâhma hour the rising from sleep.

2 Let him consider right and interest.

3 The cry of the cock is auspicious :

4 Also the sight of an elephant and so forth;

5 Also the sound of elephants, the chanting of auspicious praises, and Veda-recitation;

6 Also holy talk of divinities;

7Also recollection of nobles ;

8 Also eye-collyrium :

9Also looking in a mirror.

10Let him adern \[ himself \]

11Also chewing of betel:

12 Also camphor, sandal, incense of agallochum:

13 Conchs, *Kâhalas,* horns, cut reeds, guitars, harps, drums, kettle-drums:

14 And noises of trumpets ;

15 Also seeing of divine women :

16 Also the interrupted first note of the minstrel (?):

17Also the sound of the *jâti* melody (or 'the cry of birth ' ):

18 White flowers in liquid butter.

19 Fire satisfied with mantras becomes of one hundred flames, and attended with smoke having the sing ef Vishnu.

20 Then the spectacle of oxen is inauspicious :

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1 The Brâhma muhurta is the early morning: see Weber Indische Siudien, x. p. 296, and Aitareya Brahmana II. 15.

4 The Greek writers mention the early morning salutation of an Indian king by an elephant (Aelian, XIII. c. 22).

12 Or 'incense of camphor, sandal, and agallochum'.

21Also the spectacle of vultures

22 Also a twilight blaze :

23 Also the cry of quarrelling jackais.

24 Or the sound of carnivorous beasts is heard at the gate of village or city.

25 Where also sweating of images of gods is perceived, there departure to ancthor place is the only appeasement: there is no remedy.

26 Unavoidably to be observed are these acts.

27 Victory is rooted in counsel.

28 Men are of three kinds, best, worst and middle.

29 In counsel also \[ is the same triplicity \].

30 That action is best which is undertaken in company with connections, kinsmen, friends, the learned, the thoughtful.

31 And, when right is doubtful, devotion to a guru.

32 He is best who sets to after taking counsel with men intent on advantage.

33. If, after thinking out good and bad results, he sets to through being overcome by folly, he is the worst.

34 That counsel is best which is taken unanimously, under the guidance of policy, by wise councillors.

35 Where, at first of divers opinions, they are afterwards unanimous, that is the middle.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

25 ‛Swcating of images' : Cf. Harsha-carita, trans, p. 147, also Vergil's et maestum illacrimat templis ebur aeraque sudant (Georg. 1. 480), and Milton's

‛And the chill marble seems to sweat  
‛Whileeach peculiar power forgoes his wonied seat' .

36 Where there is broiling and reproach, one being for right, one for interest, along with women, children, and the aged, tears on the one part, anger on the other, that is the worst.

37 First the measure is introduced by the master.

38 Then with voice, action, mind, salutation, and rigid prostration let them in order of dignity be made to salute the master,

39 Let him salute him whese food Vaishravana or Vâcaspati when old refuses not to eat.

40 For the rest the opinion of each in order is to be heard.

41 The measure is to be considered after placating the master.

42 Having first extolled the master's strong points, and then weighed his master's weak points, the weak points of the adversary, and the weak points of the netural, let him again lay stress upon the master's strong points.

43 Having again described the measures and the means, and having placated the master, he is to consider the measure.

44 With careless, assailed, unfortunate persons warlike enterprises do not succeed.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

38 ‛Rigid prostration': The word dandapranama ‛prostration with the body straight as a stick' occurs in the Dashakumara-carita : see the St.potorl org lexicon.

39 Vaisravana and Vacaspati are apparently named as types of king and Brahman. Note the negativo verb abhunjate..

42 Guna and dosha arehero untechnical : cf. 11. 1.

45 Against a not careless, right-knowing person, a master of his senses, a conqueror, one angry against the powerful, and hard to assail warlike enterprise is not to be undertaken.

46 "One knowing the *Shâstras,* how does he not understand measures?" so let him not say.

47 Those who conquer the strongest enemies, pleasure and so forth, they conquer all foes.

48 Let him not make the first advance in rendering services :

49 Also let him certainly render service.

50 As regards an unavoidable disaster, having discerned it in advance, let him provide remedy for the disaster.

51 So says the Guru,

So in the *Brihaspati Sûtra* the Fourth Chapter.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

46 1.e. let him not claim practical infallibility on the ground of learning.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

V ( Upâyas )

1 Four means.

2 Also three :

3 Also pretended oversight and slaying.

4In dealing with the bold conciliation;

5 With the timid conciliation and division;

6 With the greedy conciliation, largesse, anddivision;

7 With the vexatious conciliation, division, largesse, pretended oversight, and slaying.

8 Conciliation is to be set to work first:

9 The purpose of the mind and also the friendly action of the voice.

10 Relatives are pleased at the misfortune of relatives.

11 Relatives, in their secret hearts malignant,take advantage of a relative.

12 Among all dangers the danger of relatives is to be dreaded.

13 In cows milk and in a Brâhman anger \[ are certain \] ;

14 In women fickleness, in kinsmen remoteness ; friendship is like a drop of water upon a leaf.

15 The friendly speeeh of elders, also inspired by *Sâstras,* whoso heed not, are inspired by destiny :them, therefore, let him carefully avoiding dwell afar.

16 What is at variance with convention let him Lot practise

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I The four *upayas* are, of course, war, dissensin, conciliation, and bribory.

17 Kinsmen, crocodiles among the lotuses of secrets of *mantras* and sciences; not to act without good omens; and disasters (?).

18 It must be told with avoidance of the bad: though possessed of knowledge, he is like a snake in the house,

19 An adherent from the enemy's side one should not trust.

20 According to merit let him entertain (people) in his service.

21 Let him test by their sentiments.

22 A hero is not quickly known by the weak; intelligence let him promptly test in an unknown matter.

23 He may be known by his gestures;

24 A composed person not.

25 One whose mind is without apprehension is calm.

26 And without anger for even children and so forth conceal that,

27 Upon learning the fall of his family a wise man under these circumstances would have recourse even to an enemy's side, if possessed of wisdom.

28 Unfailingly in the heart the \[ effects of \] former good and evil arise ; \[ so \] the bad man would not on all occasions act as such.

29 The fickle are not to be highly honoured.

30 So says the Preceptor Brihaspati.

So in the *Brihaspati* *Sûtra* the Fifth Chapter.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

17 The text is here corrupt, some proverbial expression apparently being involved. The import seems to be that counsel, study, and secrets, also misfortunes, should not be incautiously spoken of.

19 Accusative after *vi-shvas,* as in I. 38.

22 Reading *viro'* *sharaih sahasa na jnayate.*

26 ‛Conceal ':*vi-vri* may, it appears, sometimes have thisseuse.

27 Reading *nayayuktem.* The meaning is, however, not clear.

1 He should get to know the action suitable to place and time, also policy and impolicy :

2 Not what is contrary to Veda,manliness,and pride.

3 Let him observe friendly acts.

4 Policy is carried out after examination by cou-ncillors.

5 Let him examine what is to be done or nct to be done in conjunction with councillors living by their intellect.

6 Whoso can design even an unwelcome measure, he is to be employed in counsel.

7 Let him acquier wealth.

8 Whoso has store of wealth, has friends and righteousness and knowledge and merit and prowess and intelligenc.

9 By one without riches riches cannot be acquired, as an elephant by one without elephant.

10 In riches is rooted the world.

11 And therein are all things.

12 A man without riches is a dead man and a *Candâla.*

13 Likewise let him acquire knowledge, the root of righteousness.

14 In knowledge is rooted the world.

15 Knowledge again is all.

16 So says the Guru,\`

So in the *Brihaspati Sûtra* the Sixth Chapter.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 6 Reading *cpi karyam* in place of *vikaram.* The serse would seem to be that one who would employ his intelligence in measures which he personalydisliked would be a trustworthy councillor.
