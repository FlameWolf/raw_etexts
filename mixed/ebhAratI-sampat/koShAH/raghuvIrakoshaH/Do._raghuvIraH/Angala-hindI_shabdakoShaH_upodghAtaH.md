**Dedicated  
to  
PĀNINI AND PATAN̅JALI**  
who cast the eternal linguistic mould of India  
out of which flow  
in unbounded measure  
the expressions for  
the minutest and vastest  
percepts and concepts  
which man has or will grasp  
in his pursuit of knowledge  
of the texture of the universe.

  "It is a privilege to be associated, even though only to theextent of writing the Foreword, with the Great English-Indian Dictionary edited by Dr. Raghu Vira.

  "The work is a colossal one, both in its conception andexecution.

  "He has got together a band of enthusiasts to cooperate withhim in the work and has succeeded in presenting a monumental work.  

  "Educationists all over India have agreed that the majorobstacle for the spread of the knowledge of modern sciences in the country is the absence of appropriate terminology.

  "The Great English Indian Dictionary is an instrument ofeducation which will be of immense assistance in the spread of scientific knowledge in the country.  

  "Students and teachers of present and future generations willhave cause to feel profoundly grateful to the editor of this prodigious compilation."  

**S. S. Bhatnagar**  

*(Foreword to the Great English-Indian Dictionary, Vol. I, 1944, which is now vastly expanded and incorporated into the present volume).*

**यो मे अन्नं यो मे रसं  
वाचं श्रेष्ठां जिघांसति।  
इन्द्रश्च तस्मा अग्निश्च  
अस्त्रं हिंकारमस्यताम्॥**

(अथर्ववेद)

He who designs destruction of my food,  
Of my beverage,  
And of my noble speech,  
O Hail ! Storm ! Thunder ! and Fire !  
Roar, hurl your missile,  
And smite him.

(*Atharva-Veda*)

Following the long history of modern Indian languages  
(which has been so truly affirmed in the Constitution of India)  
our terms are drawn primarily from Sanskrit  
the classical source-language  
of this land.  
Our terms are designed to  
supply all the scores of derivatives,  
compounds and phrases needed by  
administration, education, and every other phase of national life.  

 Sanskrit terms are serviceable, not only in Hindi, but also in Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Panjabi, Tamil and Telugu. To these we may also add Sinhalese, the major language of Ceylon.

  While they will be found useful for Pan-Indian, specific technical or higher purposes,

 For local, non-specific, non-technical or popular purposes every Indian language will naturally use local or popular expressions.

 *"The difficulties of language are not negligible. One's native speech is a closely futting garment, and one never feels quite at ease when it is not immediately available and has to be replaced by another."*

**Erwin Schrödinger**

*Nobel Prize W̅inner for Physics in 1933*

 *"Modern Eastern students have to be reminded of the creative nature of their languages and to revitalice their terminology.  
 "They, too, have consciously to revive their abstract and stagnant use of terms by retracing the meanings from the original productive and concrete roots."*

**Betty Heimann**

*("The Signi ficance of Prefixes in Sanskrit Philosophical Terminology" p.vi)*

**OUR COST**

* The expenses on the Dictionary include not only those for paper, printing and book-binding but alsothesalaries of the staff during the last five years. The amount is over four lacs of rupees.If this cost were to be spread over this edition, which consists of four thousand copies, then we shouldhave to price it in a way that after deducting the sales' commission and advertisement charges we may realise Rs. 100/- per copy. That would mean pricing each copy at near about 150 rupees.  
 But the Dictionary is intended to serve the people, and hence the price is kept at Rs. 30/- per copy. We hope that the public would appreciate its cheapness and help us in our future work which will continue as long as we do not complete our target of two million terms.*

* "If I had the powers of a despot, I would today stop the tuition of our boys and girls through a foreign medium,*

* "And require all the teachers and professors on pain of dismissal to introduce the change forthwith.*

* "It is an evil that needs a summary remedy."*

**Mahatma Gandhi**

PREFACE

 The Divine Being created the forms of the universe, but it is we who give them names and thereby bring them into the orbit of our consciousness. That which remains outside our ken remains unnamed.

**सर्वंवा इदं नाम च रूपं च ।  
देवो रूपाणि चक्रे वयं नामानि कृण्मसि ॥**

Hence as we advance the horizon, our terminology must keep pace with it, otherwise our  
horizon will become dim and hazy. A progressive and creative people have a progressive anda creative language. Daily progress is registered in daily linguistic creation.

 India is emerging out of the mediaeval ages. Her languages have been till recently capable of expressing nothing more than mediaeval ideas. Hindi and her sister tongues stand on about the same level. To usher in the new age it is absolutely essential to equip Hindi (and with it the other literary idioms of India) with Indian equivalents for almost every word of the English language that has a bearing on literature and technique. Knowledge has been divided into about 600 special branches. To name only a few: accounts, aeronautics, agriculture, animal husbandry, anatomy, angling, anthropology, architecture, art, astronomy, astrophysics, athletics and sports, aviation, bacteriology, banking, biochemistry, biology, botany, brewing, cartography, ceramics, chemistry, chess, commerce and finance, craniometry, dancing, dentistry, dramaturgy, economics, education, engineering, forestry, gambling, gems and jewelry, geography, geology, history, horology, horticulture, hunting and field sports, insurance, law, logic, machinery and tools, mathematics, medicine, metallurgy, meteorology, mining and ore-dressing, music, nautical and naval terms, newspapers, numismatics, optics, painting,paleontology, papermaking, petrography, petrology, pharmacy, philately, philology and linguistics, philosophy, photography and motion pictures, physics, physiology, politics, printing and engraving, psychology and psychiatry, radio, railways, sculpture, ship-building, sociology, surgery, textiles, transportation (air, land and marine), veterinary science, warfare, zoology.  
 It has been our design and endeavour to exert ourselves to provide this gigantic mass of technical and semi-technical terms and expressions. All told, the total may exceed two millions. It is a staggering figure.  
 One might well feel weak and faint, but tackled slowly, steadily and systematically, the  
task is proving capable of achievement.  
 We started on the idea in 1931 and the first trial fasciculus was brought forth in 1943. We have worked on one subject after another. We have tackled by now a good many of the foundational subjects and the present volume alone covers one hundred and fifty thousand specific terms and phrases.

 Our sources have been manifold.  
 On the English side we have used numerouslexicographical works, both general and special. Among the general works one would naturallyrecount the Oxford English Dictionary in 13 volumes (including the Supplement) and Noah Webster's New International Dictionary of English Language in 2 volumes. The first, which is unrivalled for its historical treatment of each and every word, is superceded by the second by its greateremphasis on modern terms.  
 The number of special dictionaries is legion. For every branch of learning we have used one or more dictionaries.  
 On the Indian side we have used all that is available for Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit and modern Indian languages. In Sanskrit the ancient Kośas form a dignified array. They have been supplemented by works of 19th and 20th century scholarship, such as the Sabda-kalpa-druma of Radhākäntadeva in Sanskrit (Calcutta, 1322-58), Sanskrit-Wörterbuch by Otto Böhtlingk and Rudolph Roth in German (published by the Royal Academy of Sciences in Russia, St. Petersburgh, 1855-75), Sanskrit-English Dictionary by M. Monier-Williams (Oxford, 1899), and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Dictionary by Franklin Edgerton (Yale, U. S. A., 1953) in English.  
 Besides, we had to compile our own English-Sanskrit and English-Pali indexes. Without these we could not have had at our disposal a complete picture of all that is available under a particular English term. The number of cards in these indexes approximates four hundred thousand. It is the biggest collection that has so far been made. We intend to issue this material in the form of two independent works. One would be a Comprehensive English-Sanskrit Dictionary, which will extend over ten volumes, each volume comprising about one thousand pages. It will incorporate the entire recorded material which is inconceivably rich andvaried. The second would be an English-Pali Dictionary in one volume of 1500 octavo pages.  
 For modern Indian languages we have used monolingual and bilingual dictionaries prepared in the 19th and 20th centuries. Some of them are works of great erudition but unfortunately all all far short of our requirements. Linguistically these dictionaries can be divided into three groups: (a) English to Hindi, (b) Hindi to English, (c) Hindi to Hindi. Similarly for other languages.  
 There is still another group of dictionaries whose guidance we have occasionally sought. These are bilingual dictionaries of major civilised languages which have technical literature and technical vocabularies. For example, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Russian in the West and Arabic, Persian, Chinese and Japanese in the East. We have not ignored smaller languages like Finnish in Europe and Annamese in Asia. Their varying capacities to express new ideas help us on our path.  
 To the dictionaries we must add yet another category of books without which our formations would have lacked organic life i.e. the capacity to integrate with the context. These are standard books in cach domain; and in the case of administration the codes and manuals of each department of the government. In law there are the Codes and numerous Acts which we waded through. Each word, compound and phrase has been provided for in Hindi with due consideration to its associations and surroundings.  
 Our special lexicons, text-books, codes and manuals still needed experienced men to interpret them, to discuss and to help in the decision of the one or more equivalents that would serve in Hindi and other Indian languages. We havehad the cooperation, long or short, of over 200 specialists.

 From 1943 up to 1946 we issued four volumes of the Great English-Indian Dictionary. The first concerned Inorganic Chemistry. The second dealt with Organic Chemistry, and extended up to the letter D. The third was a special volume on Scientific Apparatus. The fourth dealt with Chemical Dyes and Colours, with an Appendix on Intermediate Products. In these volumes each Indian word appeared in four scripts, two of the North and two of the

South viz., Devanagari and Bengali, Kannada and Tamil.  
 During the period 1947-54 we issued a number of special dictionaries—  
 1. **वाणिज्य-शब्दकोष**(a Dictionary of Commerce, with special reference to Book-keeping and Accountancy), in collaboration with Shri B. S. Audholia, M.A. and Shri P. L. Baldua, M.A., both Principals of Commerce Colleges at Jabalpur. 1947.

  10. *Indian Conventional Signs for Topographical Maps of the Survey of India*, in collaboration with Shri B. G. Tamaskar, M.A. April 1950.  
  11.**खनिज-अभिज्ञान,** in collaboration with Prof. N. L. Sharma, Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad; Dr. S. D. Limaye, Ph.D., Poona; and Dr. Lokesh Chandra, M.A., D.Litt. 1953.  
 12: *Indian Scientific Nomenclature of the Mammals of India, Burma and Ceylon,* in collaboration with Shri K, N. Dave and Dr. Lokesh Chandra, M.A., D.Litt. 1953.  
Agricultural Statistics terms were prepared in response to the request of the Department, and were published in the Journal of the Indian Society of Agricultural Statistics, 1948, Vol.I, No.2. Mr. Ramgopal, M.A., had been deputed by the Department as my collaborator.  
  Early in 1947 I was entrusted with the preparation of terms and text-books on chemistry, mathematics, physics, botany and zoology by the Government of Madhya Pradesh. With the operation of the professors, readers and lecturers of the Nagpur University complete terminology up to the B.Sc. and text-books for the Intermediate were produced under my generaleditorship. Each book was written in two languages, namely, Hindi and [Marathi.[^1], Hindi version : A. P. Shrivastava, M.Sc.")This is⠀the first set of scientific university books with a uniform and co-ordinated Indian terminology.

 There is no complete record of the numerous books produced elsewhere which have used our terminology either wholly or partly. They cover not only university subjects but go beyond them.

  In 1948 Dr. Rajendra Prasad, then the President of the Constituent Assembly of India, entrusted me along with other friends, with the task of developing the terminology required for the translation of the English text of our Constitution into Hindi and other languages of India. The terminology was di-scussed and approved by an All-India Committee of Linguistic Experts representing as many as thirteen languages of India recognized by the Constitution, namely, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu, Kashmiri, Assamese, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya and Panjabi. This terminology has already been used in the translations of the Constitution into several of these languages.

  I, my collaborators and staff have also worked for complete terminologies of Railway, Food and Agriculture, Parliamentary Practice; and for every Department of the Madhya Pradesh Government. The ground covered by the present Dictionary may briefly be indicated as follows:

  It is a complete compendium for running the administrative machinery. It registers not only single words and compounds but even the oft-used phrases (which are more or less conceptual integers to the administrator). One would find all that one may need for general administration, accounts, finance, budget, auditing, public works, industries, railways, etc., etc. In forestry every plant that grows in the Himalayas, Sundarbans or Nilgiris has received due mention in the Dictionary. The entire Ayurvedie literature has been ransacked to supply the names where they existed, and when nothing existed suitable names have been devised. It is not only the popular English names that have been provided for but the binomial and trinomial systems have been carefully and laboriously worked out.

  In law we have aimed at comprehensiveness. There would hardly be a legal term which would not be found here.

  In medicine, the Dictionary covers its dif. ferent branches, from anatomy to pharmacy and bacteriology. A complete volume containing everything medical would have been beyond the scope of the present work. That will appear separately.

  In fundamental sciences, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, statics, dynamics, differential and integral calculus, astronomy, inorganic and organic chemistry, bio-chemistry, physical chemistry, physics, botany, zoology, have been dealt with in such fair measure that they will take up the students at the universities far beyond the B.Sc. courses.

  Agriculture, commerce, economics, education, engineering, entomology, geography, geology, insurance, irrigation, logic, mechanics, metallurgy, meteorology, mineralogy, mycology, opthalmology, paleontology, politics, psychology, surveying and a host of other branches of learning have been included in the Dictionary.

  It is hoped that the Dictionary will serve the largest number of administrators, lawyers, industrialists, scientists and teachers and will be an indispensable instrument in the hands of authors for bringing modern knowledge to the very doors of the masses.

  It is essentially a work of cooperation of specialists. The names of most of them are found on the title pages of our dictionaries. Still others appear as co-authors of the text-books. listed before.

  In conclusion it is my great joy to recall themany benevolent friends who have shared withme the idea and the cause, and hav contributedtowards its realization. The first great friend was the late Sir N. Gopalaswamy Ayyangar, then the Prime Minister of the State of Jammu and Kashmir. His was the grant that initiated thework in 1942. It was followed by generous donations of Raj Rajendra Lt.-Col. M. N. Shitole of Gwalior. He was followed by Seth Shri Ja Dayalji whose deep love and munificence havebeen our constant comrades. It is he who made it possible to produce the present voluminoustome. Hon'ble Pandit Ravi Shankar Shukla, the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, took us out of the blazing fires of 1946-47 Lahore, and established us in Nagpur. Here for the last eight years we have had the assistance of numerous specialists. Here have been produced text-books of science. Again it is here that a fair start has been made in shifting over to Hindi and Marathi as the media of public administration. Shri B. G. Kher, as the Chief Minister of Bombay, made a decent grant towards one of our previous volumes.  
  My son Dr. Lokesh Chandra has been taking interest in the Dictionary project since the pre-paration of the first fasciculus in 1943. With every year his interest has been on the increase. From April 1950 he has devoted himself almost entirely to it. Since then he has borne the manifold duties of maintaining the card-indexes, of controlling the work of collaborators and assistants, of getting the press-copy ready and of seeing the different dictionaries through the press. Since 1952 he has participated in the formation of terms as well. All this he has done with cheer and credit. Without his constant devotion to the cause and its exccution it would not have been possible to fulfill our plans.  
   A word to the users of this Dictionary. Kindly note that it is a special dictionary and as  
such it serves your special needs, in whatever direction they may lie. If however there be items such as you find missing in this volume, please do not hesitate in writing to us. If you  
find imperfections, as there must be, kindly do point them out to us.  
  Now Hindi and other Indian languages can stand erect, survey the fields of knowledge,  
create their own literatures, widen the horizons and raise the stature of the growing and future generations. With this faith we embark the Dictionary, the biggest of its kind in Asia, on its voyage of utility to the Motherland.

**INTRODUCTION**

  Words and thoughts are inseparably connected. New thoughts need new words. Words  
again can be opaque or transparent. Words can be borrowed from another language or they can be created out of the same language. Borrowed words taken out into a new sphere, even though originally transparent, become opaque, and lose their productivity.

  Some languages build extensively, others to a limited extent only. There are others which  
borrow extensively because they can build only sparingly.

  While every language builds to a certain extent, it is only a very small number that build  
constantly, and not only single stray words but whole systems. These are the three great classical languages of the world. They are coming down from ancient times. They have been cultivated continuously over centuries and milleniums. They are Sanskrit in India, Chinese in the Far East, and Latin (with Greek) in the West. They cover wide expanses of time and space. The languages in Europe, from Icelandish to Russian, depend for their new formations on Latin. In India and South-East Asia Sanskrit is the source. The domain of Chinese is China, Manchuria and Japan.

 There The history of Sanskrit is long and varied. are few persons in our country who are capable to survey its field. To begin with, Sanskrit is an all-India language. Its literature is also pan-Indian. It does not belong to any particular locality. Every province has contributed to it. In the North, Panjabi, Hindi and Nepali; in the East, Assamese, Bengali and Oriya; in the West, Sindhi, Gujarati and Marathi; and in the South beyond the shores of India in the jewel island of Ceylon, Singhalese are the grand-daughters of Sanskrit. Or, we might put it the other way-Sanskrit speakers were the fore. fathers of the present Panjabis, Bengalis and the rest. During the passage of centuries, there was a change and Sanskrit passed through the stages of Pali, Prakrits and Apabhramsas to the present day formations. But while changes occurred in daily speech, Sanskrit literature continued to flourish in every area.

  Sanskrit had extended even beyond the limits of modern India. Kashmir, Chitral, Swat, Afghanistan, Central Asia and Chinese Turkestan were at one time the centres for the radiation of Sanskrit language and civilisation.

  In between Singhalese and Marathi, that is in the region where Dravidian languages now prevail, Sanskrit was cultivated with equal or even greater ardour. Some of our brilliant philosophers and men of letters have come from this area. \[ cite here just two names, may  
Sankarācārya and Sāyaṇācārya, the greatest philosopher and Vedist respectively.

** **Beyond the ocean, in distant Malaya, Sumatra, Java and Borneo, up to the islands of Philippines, sailors and merchants, princes andscholars took Sanskrit with them.\*

** **  \* We have recently published a big volume of over four hundred and fifty closely printed pages entitled "Sanskrit in Indonesia ", wherein the history of Sanskrit words from Madagascar (near the mainland of Africa) up to Philippines has been treated. We refer the curious readers to this volume,

 Soekarno (i. e. सु-कर्ण the virtuous Karna who fights on the side of good, as against the Karna of Mahabharata who fought on the side of evil),are further evidence of their Sanskrit background.

  In Cambodia, Sanskrit inscriptions have been found from the earliest time of their history up to the 14th century, that is as long as India was able to maintain her foreign relations. Hundreds of lithic documents in the form of royal inscriptions in gorgeous Kävya style have been discovered and published by two generations of French savants. They stand testimony to the use of Sanskrit as the language of learned men and royal courts for a thousand years and over.

 One might look at the Thai Dictionary by George Bradley McFarland and on a single page read उपमा, उपमान, उपमेय, उपयुवराज, उपयोग, उपरि, उपरिचर, उपरिबुद्धि, उपरिभाव, उपरिम, उपसर्ग, उपसम्पदा, उपाध्याय, etc. Under कर्मकार‘a governmental official body' one reads several scores of names of departments, such as कर्म-जलप्रदान Irrigation Department, कर्म-धर्मकार Ecclesiastical Department, कर्म-नगरादर Department of Municipal Affairs, etc. बीजगणित is algebra and त्रिकोणमिति is trigonometry, same as we have in India.

 The names of months like Caitra, Vaisakha, Kārttika, prevailed from Madagascar, up to Philippines. The Saka era is still used in Bali, Java and Burma. There are thousands of Ayurveda practitioners in Sri Lankā.

 The modern languages of North India may besaid to have had four to ten centuries of literary activity. During this period they have freely drawn upon Sanskrit. There has been no age at which Sanskrit has not supplied their life-sap. The same is true for Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam. One has only to glance at the big-sizedictionaries of these languages and calculate. One finds that out of one lakh of vocabulary entries the Sanskrit element is be-tween 70 to80 thousand. Even in Tamil which has tried to maintain relative purity of usage and hashad less of Sanskrit than the others, the number of Sanskrit vocables is above forty thousand. I may cite from the Tamil Lexicon, published under the authority of the University of Madras, Vol. 6, 1934, p.3872, where almost every word is Sanskrit (sometimes adapted phonetically to the requirements of Tamil). It contains even a word which is new for ordinary Hindi men—जातिमासम्meaning the calendar month. The page begins with a natya term, जात्तियम् (जात्य), जात्तिरै (यात्रा, through Hindi जात्रा), जातक कतै (जातक-कथा), जातक पावम् (जातक-भाव) 'agreement between the horoscopes of the bride and bridegroom', जातकी the person whose horoscope is under reference', जाति-त्वेषम्जाति-तर्मम्, जाति-प्रष्टम् are respectively जाति-द्वेष, जाति-धर्म and जाति-भ्रष्ट. जाति पुष्पम् is jasmine. जाति-मल्लिकै (जाति-मल्लिका) is the large-flowered jasmine. Then come words connected with caste जाति-लक्षणम् जाति-लिङ्कम् (जाति-लिङ्गम्), जाति-जीवनम् जाति-साङ्कर्यम् जाति-स्वरम् are a class of musical notes.

 For higher thoughts and for technical purposes Sanskrit supplies common terms for the languages of the North and the South, the East and the West. Poetry, religion, philosophy, medicine and astronomy are replete with Sanskrit terms.

 The recent Constitution of the Republic of Burma has put it down in the form of an article that the advancement and cultivation of Sanskrit and Pali are the concern of the state.

 The Constitution of India has also laid it down in unmistakable terms that Sanskrit shall be the primary source for the evolution of Hindi, the official language of the whole of India. Although not mentioned in the Constitution the same is true for other languages as well.

 The capacity of Sanskrit as a building language is great. It is as great as that of Latin and  
Chinese or perhaps even greater, but certainly in no case less.

 The technical terminology of modern technique when derived from Sanskrit will bring scientific thought in line with literary thought. The ancient bricks for literature and science shall be the same. The future scientific expressions of India will form an integrated whole with the pre-existing literary ones. In English and other European languages it is not always so.

 Our building material consists of three elements (a) verbal roots, (b) suffixes, and (c) prefixes.

 In Panini, the greatest codifier of language, the number of verbal roots approximates two thousand. But in use, one hardly finds seven hundred. Out of these we append here a list of about 520. These are the roots which lie at the basis of our vocabularies, old and new. The new one, particularly, does not go beyond them.

 Verbal roots are the abstractions of grammarians. They become usable only with the addition of suffixes, one, two or more. Nouns, adjectives, adverbs are derived from roots.

 One may wonder as to how it is possible for five hundred roots to serve the variegated patterns of ancient and modern knowledge. Here prefixes come in. When prefixed to roots they give them new directions, and the few hundred roots are multiplied to thousands and lakhs.

 At the persistent request of the users of our vocabularies we give here a list of the verbal roots, suffixes and prefixes. This should prove useful for reference. The meanings supplied are the minimum. The examples of derivatives from these roots are also the minimum. While the Indian user, ignorant of Sanskrit, may not be conversant with the verbal roots, he will discover that he knows the derivatives quoted to the extent of eighty to ninety per cent. It is irres-pective of the language which may be his mother-tongue. It may be Hindi, Assamese, Gujarati, Bengali, Oriya or Marathi. It may be Kannada, Telugu or Malayalam. It may be even Singhalese. After he has done any one of these languages up to the high school stage he will find that he has done enough by way of ground-work. What follows is only to lead him from the known to the unknown, from words to their roots. As regards prefixes and suffixes, most of these also he has met with in the study of his mother-tongue, such as Bengali or Malayalam. But now he is introduced to these as separate linguistic elements, which would help him in the analysis and under-standing of what he has known as well as what he is going to know.

**VERBALROOTS**

 The following list contains four items (1) roots, (2) one or two meanings, (3) one or two examples, (4) their common meaning, with occasional reference to a Modern Indian form derived from it. In the examples quoted one would sometimes meet prefixes.

 We would request our reader to test his knowledge by going through the examples and noting as to how many he already knows and how many of them are new to him. When he discovers that the vast majority are old acquaintances, he will get new courage to approach and master the present terminology which is based upon them.

The above is a list of primary roots. From them are derived passives, causatives, desideratives and intensives.

  Passives are formed by the addition of य. Causatives, desideratives and intensives also  
have two forms, one active and the other passive.

 Causatives are the commonest class of derivative verbs. They are formed with the suffix अय. Most of the verbs in I insert प् before अय, e.g दाto give, दापय to cause to give.

 Desideratives are formed by adding to the root, which is reduplicated in a particular way, the suffix स, इष - जिज्ञासा desire to know, जिज्ञासु desirous of knowing; are well-known examples of action and agent desiderative nouns.

Intensives are rare. Here also the root is reduplicated. दंश् to bite' has an intensive derivative agent noun दंदशूक ‛that which bites intensely, i.e, a serpent'.

**NOMINAL VERBS**

 An inexhaustible source for forming fresh roots are nouns, pronouns and adjectives. They are known as nominal verbs. Hundreds of them are used in literature. Here we append a short illustrative list.

 The form cited is usually third person, singular number, present tense. The forms used in Hindi would be those that end in Kṛt suffixesThose are easily derivable, e.g. अंकुरण sprouting अंकुरित sprouted.

**SUFFIXES**

 The use of pure roots is rare. It is by the addition of suffixes that they assume the functions of agent or action nouns, of adjectives or adverbs. Nouns take on still other affixes andform adjectives. Adjectives form abstract nouns. There are suffixes for denoting comparative and superlative degrees.

**I. Primary Suffixes**

 These are the suffixes that are added on to verbal roots. In the Paninian system they are designated as Krt (which include the un-adis). Some of them are of wide usage, affixable to all roots, while others are of limited application.

In Hindi the forms of Sanskrit cardinals and numerals from 10 to 18 will thus be identical.

**एकोनविंश 19th** (एकोनविंशति 19)**.  
विंश 20th** (विंशति 20)**.  
त्रिंश 30th** (त्रिंशत् 30)**.  
चत्वारिंश 40th** (चत्वारिंशत् 40)**.  
पञ्चाश 50th** (पञ्चाशत् 50)**.**

**(77)** तम forms ordinals from षष्टि '60' onwards.

**षष्टितम 60th.  
शततम 100th.  
सहस्रतम 1000th.**

  तम is also usable after विंशति, त्रिंशत्, चत्वारिंशत् and पञ्चाशत्— विंशतितम, त्रिंशत्तम, चत्वारिंशत्तम, पञ्चाशत्तम.

**(78)** कृत्वःforms numerical adverbs, from पञ्च onwards.

**पञ्चकृत्वःfive times.  
शतकृत्वः hundred times.**

**(79)** धाdenotes 'way' or 'part'.

**द्विधा in two ways, in two parts.  
शतधा in 100 ways, in 100 parts.**

**(80)** तय denotes 'consisting of' or 'collection'.

**द्वितय consisting of two parts, collection of two.**

  There are other suffixes and forms which cover one, two or three cases only, e.g. प्रथम first, चतुर्थ fourth, षष्ठ sixth, सकृत् once, द्विःtwice, त्रिःthrice, चतुःfour times.

**PREFIXES**

**  **Now we come to the prefixes or upasargas. Arranged in alphabetic order the twenty upasargas run as follows - **अति । अधि । अनु ।अप ।अपि । अभि । उद् । उप । दुः । नि । निः । परा । परि । प्र । प्रति । वि । सम् ।सु ॥** Every school child is familiar with them.  
  Yāska, the oldest authority on the science of etymology, and the predecessor of Pāṇini, asserts that the prefixes add their specific meanings to the dynamics of the verbal root to which they are attached :

**आख्यातमुपगृह्यार्थविशेषमिमे तस्यैव सृजन्तीत्युपसर्गाः।**

  They are either अर्थ-वाचकाः"independent bearers of meanings", or अर्थ-द्योतकाः"illuminants of the meanings immanent" in the verb. They are even सहकारिणः" cooperants". (See Puṇyarāja's comment on Kārikā 190 of the Vākyapadīya of Bhartṛhari).

  Prefixes have been widely used, not only singly but in combinations of two and threes. The recorded combinations are above three hundred and forty. Of these more than one hundred and ten are combinations of three. Combines of four are rare :

**संव्यपाश्रित**— सं + वि +अप + आ + √ श्रि + suffix त.  
**समभिव्याहरण**— सम् + अभि + वि + आ + √ हृ + suffix अन.

Even the same prefix is doubled— सु-सु-गन्ध, सु-सु-भिक्ष, प्र-प्र-स्थान, प्र-प्र-जनन, अध्यधिक्षेप, अध्यधीन, उपोपवेशन, अत्यतिक्रम, etc., etc.

  Arithmetically all possible combinations of twos would total up to 400, while of threes up to 3000. But in practice we have not found it necessary to go beyond the 340-combinations employed during the four thousand years of literary activity.

  How many combinations of upasargas may be used with one single root is illustrated by the root इ 'to go'. Hereunder we quote the 107-single upasargas as well as their combinations with which derivatives of the root इ, like इत, अय, अयन have been used in general language.

  अय and अयन are the common action nouns from इ. With them are formed some of the commonest words— अन्वय syntax, उपाय means, न्याय justice, उदय rise, अभिप्राय purpose, व्यय expenses, आय income, पर्याय synonym, पलायन running, प्रत्यय suffix, समय time, agreement, etc.  
Addition of त forms past passive participles, e.g.— अतीत, व्यतीत, समतीत, अधीत, अन्वित, समन्वित, उदित, प्रेत, प्रतीत, विपरीत, परीत, संप्रतीत.

  In the formation of new terms the upasargas have been utilised in due measure. They give direction and distinction. Those who intend to pursue their study would do well to go through the unique monograph of Prof. Betty Heimann— "The Significance of Prefixes in Sanskrit Philosophical Terminology".

**उपसर्गेण धात्वर्थो बलादन्यत्र नीयते।  
प्रहार-आहार-संहार-विहार-परिहार-वत्॥**

  Hereunder are given the twenty upasargas, with their chief meanings, followed by a few examples, all from ancient literature.

  Upasargas are used with verbs, nouns and their derivatives.

  Upasargas can be used singly, or in twos, threes and even fours.

  Collocations of upasargas, with at least one example, are put under the first member of the collocation.

  A rough approximation of the occurrence of each upasarga is given in figures enclosed within brackets.

  Prefixes (20), roots (about 520) and suffixes (about 80), when conjoined, are capable of forming millions of words. It is clear that we shall never run short of words. Even to deal with a single root in all its variety would cover a volume. From existing literature alone onecould compile a few hundred pages of material dealing with the ramifications of a general root like **कृ**.

  Here we shall content ourselves by presenting just one common root **गम्** to go. Life centres round movement and it is but natural, that our ancients who named the world *saṃsāra, jagat,* which mean 'the ever-moving', should have utilised the idea of movement to include a large number of aspects and things of life.

  The direct derivatives of **गम्** are : **गत** gone, departed, situated in, contained in, relating to, frequented. **गतक- गति** movement, gait, passage, course, resource, condition. **गतिक, गतिला, गत्वन्.** **गत्वर** transient, perishable. **गन्तव्य** to be attained, to be undergone, to be approached. **गन्तु** a way, wayfarer. **गन्त्रिका** a small cart. **गम** march, decampment, (in mathematics) removal of fractions. **गमक** indicative, explanatory. **गमथ** a road. **गमन** departure. **गमनिका** explanatory paraphrase. **गमनीय** accessible, approachable. **गमयितृ** leading to. **गमित** sent, brought. **गमिन** intending to go. **गमिष्ठ** most ready to go. **गमिष्णु** intending to depart. गभ्य passable, attainable, dissolute. **गम्यमान, गमिक. गामुक** and **गामिन्** reaching or extending to, directed towards, etc., etc.

  Many of these forms are found used with prefixes which often modify the meaning. We shall take a few here:

 ** अधिगम्** to find, to obtain, to accomplish, to study. **अधिगत** acquired, learnt. **अधिगन्तव्य, अधिगन्तृ.** **अधिगम** mastery, study, knowledge, profit. **अधिगमन, अधिगमनीय, अधिगम्य.**

  **उपगम्** to go near, to visit, to attend to admit. **उपगत** approximate.**उपगति, उपगम, उपगमन, उपगम्य, उपगामिन्, उपजिगमिषु.**

  **सुगम** еasy of access, easily understood. **सुगत, सुगति,** etc., etc.

  So far we have given only single prefixes with the simplest form of derivatives. There are still bunches of twos and threes which add to the richness of the language without burdening the memory. We cite the combinations without either the actual forms or their specific connotations— **अन्वागम्। अभिनिर्गम्। अभिसंगम्। अभिसमागम्। अभ्यागम्। अभ्युपागम्। अभ्युद्गम्। अभ्युपगम्। उपनिगम्। उपसंगम्। न्यागम्। पर्यागम्। प्रत्यवगम्। प्रत्यागम्। प्रत्युद्गम्। प्रविगम्। प्रोद्गम्। विनिर्गम्। विप्रगम्। संनिगम्। समधिगम्। समनुगम्। समन्वागम्। समभिगम्। समभ्यागम्। समवगम्। समागम्। समुदागम्। समुद्गम्। समुपगम्। समुपागम्। सम्प्रत्यागम्॥**

**GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF INDIAN TERMINOLOGY**

  *1. One word conveys only one primary meaning.*

*  *For every primary meaning there is a separate word.

  2. *Words are **अन्वर्थ**significant.*

*  *They lead in the direction in which the thing or idea denoted lies; they point to some salient feature.

  They may even be founded on the basis of an exclusive characteristic.

  3. *Simple English words are translated by simple words and not by compounds or phrases.*

*  *Where this principle is transgressed the reason is a greater or more immediate grasp. For example budget is translated by **आय-व्ययक**, and gazette by **राज-पत्र.**

**  **This principle establishes the distinction between a term and a definition.

  4. *The length of a simple uncompounded word is kept strictly within bounds. Two and three syllables form the norm; four is the limit.*

*  *Two, three or four syllables include the prefix, root and suffix. **प्रजा**is composed of the upasarga **प्र**, root **जन्** and suffix’**आ**. **विधान**'legislation' is composed of upasarga **वि**, root धाand suffix **अन**.

  The limit is crossed only in unavoidable cases, such as ancient words and derivatives. Scientific colour names incorporate within themselves the complete definition in terms of hue, saturation and brilliance.

  If one would glance at the English words and their Indian counterparts in the Dictionary, one would find that the graphic units in the simple Indian words are restricted to four, while those in English may be many more. As a rule Indian words do not occupy space than corresponding English words.

  If an idea is new, persons are likely to express it by a phrase, but the phrase cannot be used as a term. It is different in Chinese.

**  अग्निरथ-गमन-आगमन-सूचक-लोहपट्टिका** may be a picturesque description of 'signal' but cannot be said to be a term. Our term is simple **संकेत**. It is not equally picturous but it is far more handy.

5. *Distinctive prefixes and suffixes of a particular branch of knowledge are normally to be translated by corresponding prefixes and suffixes.*

For example :

**परिfor peri**... peri-meter परि-माप  
**अनु for sub** ... sub-genus अनु-प्रजाति  
**सं for con**  ...con-dense सं-घनन  
**अप for ab ** ... ab-rade अप-घर्षण  
**प्रतिfor anti**... anti-mere प्रति-खण्ड  
**सु for eu**   ...eu-pepsia सु-पचन  
**दुस् for dys** ... dys-pnea दुः-श्वसनetc. etc.

(Historically Greek dys and Indian **दुस्**are the same).

  Let us now take suffixes. The main word is sometimes abbreviated; as in chemistry. Phosphorus is abridged to phosph, and to it are added one or more suffixes—ate, at-ed, at-ic, at-ide, at-ion, ide, in, in-ic, on-ic, etc.

  Phosphorus is **भास्वर**, and phosph **भास्व**. Ate is **ईय**, ed **इत**, ic **इक**, ide **एय**, ion **अन**, in **इ** and on **आ**. Hence,phosphate **भास्वीय**, phosphated **भास्वीयित**, phosphatic **भास्वीयिक**, phosphatide **भास्वीयेय**, phosphation **भास्वीयन**, phosphide **भास्वेय**, phosphin **भास्वि**, phosphinic **भास्वियिक**, phosphonic **भास्वायिक** (**य्** serves as the glide between two vowels).

  6. *When the English word is a significant compound and duly conveys its technical significance, the Indian word is similarly formed.*

*  *For example, centrifugal and centripetal signify 'running away from and towards the centre' respectively. The component parts of the Indian words are**केन्द्र+अपग** (**ग** going **अप** away) and **केन्द्र+अभिग** (**ग** going **अभि** towards).

  Similarly, tetramerous is **चतुरवयव** (tetra **चतुर्**+merous अवयव). In organic chemistry a compound may run over great lengths and may be composed of five, six or more elements. That is no longer within the range of ordinary language. It is the specialist's jargon. In such cases our words have of necessity to follow the specialist's needs. In our system there is no difficulty in translating these compounds, whatever length may have. Translation proceeds smoothly and precisely, word by word, abbreviation by abbreviation, number by number.

  7. *If a term in English has a number of distinctive derivatives, all of them are provided for.*

For example :

law **विधि**  
lawful **विधिवत्, विधिसंगत**  
legal **वैध**  
illegal **अवैध**  
legislation **विधान**  
legislative **विधायी**  
legislator **विधायक**  
legislatable **विधेय**  
illegislatable **अविधेय**  
lawless **विधिहीन**  
lawlessness **विधिहीनता**

  8. *Where needed a word is allowed one or more abridged forms.*

*  *Provision is thus made for all the required combinations which a highly developed science like mathematics, physics or chemistry demands.

  Oxygen is **जारक** (**जारक** is based on the ancient term**जारण**which has been used in ancient alchemical literature for oxidization).

  In English *oxygen* is abbreviated to *oxy,* as in *oxy-hydrogen, oxy-ketone, oxy-purine*. It has also another abbreviation *ox*, as in *ox-amide*. *Oxa* denotes the pre-sence of oxygen replacing carbon, especially in a ring. *Oxo* is also to be distinguished from *oxy*.

  **जारक** is abbreviated to **जार**for *oxy* and for *ox*-**जारक** is formed from root **जॄ**which has a guna form **जर**. Both**जॄ** and**जर** have been used for *oxa* and *oxo* respectively.

  In chemistry the symbols for all the 92 elements (or including those made up in the laboratory, 98) have to be distinct. Hence, every Indian element name begins with a distinct syllable.

  9. *No word is considered and translated individually. It is taken along with its grammatical derivatives (such as nouns, verbs, adjectives). Semantically it is considered along with its synonyms and antonyms.*

Examples of grammatical derivatives are—

Examples of semantic correlates are—

  10. *In case of ideas and objects that have existed from ancient times, old names are assiduously hunted out from the vast range of Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit literatures. Modern Indian languages are also consulted.*

  Thus we maintain a historical continuity between the past and the present. We have laboured for long years in this domain. Our special success has been in the names of flowers and plants, birds and mammals. As noted before, most of this material will appear in our forthcomingEnglish-Sanskrit and English-Pali Dictionaries. Here we have been able to utilise only a fraction.

  11. *For new ideas new suffixes have been devised.*

  They originate in genuine words, whose first part is clipped off, allowing only one or two syllables to remain. Of the two syllables, the first is usually a vowel which coalesces naturally with a preceding vowel and constitutes a well-knit whole. Thus in chemistry :

  **-आतु**is abridged from a 'metal'. It is used as a suffix in forming the names of metals. It is the counterpart of English *-ium,
-um.*

  **-आति** is abridged from वाति 'gas'. It is used as a suffix in forming the names of gases. It is the counterpart of English *-on.*

*  ***-ला**is abridged from **विरला(मृद्)** 'rare (earth)'. It is used as a suffix in forming the names of rare earth metals (atomic nos. 39, 57-60, 62, 64-71).

  In mineralogy **-इज**is abridged from **खनिज**'mineral'. It is used as a suffix in forming the names of minerals. Cf. English *-ite* (abridged from *-lite*, which is equivalent to *-lith*, from French *-lithe*, from Greek *lithos*stone).

  This clipping system obtains all over the world, from English to Chinese.

  We have resorted to the creation of new suffixes only in cases of pressing requirement of a science. All told that would not exceed a dozen.

  12. *Phonetically every word is designed to fit in with the Indian genius. Harsh sounds and awkward consonant combinations are avoided.*

*  *13. *Our words are usable in Hindi and most other languages of the North, South, East and West of India.*

  The overwhelming majority of the terms in this Dictionary will help in simultaneous development of Indian languages as a whole. Only for non-technical and popular purposes would there be different terms in each region.

  14. *Technical terms are a supplement the general dictionary.*

*  *While the technical dictionary adds to the existing language and in a technical way modifies it, all the same it does not replace the words of the general language. The higher one ascends, the more one uses special terms. But in every day speech and writing the common language will continue more or less as it is today.

**Special Terminologies**  
**\_\_\_\_\_**

**CONSTITUTION, LAW, ADMINISTRATION, ECONOMICS & POLITICS**

  The general principles that have been outlined in the preceding section have been followed faithfully in devising the terminology of social and natural sciences.

  In constitution, law and administration our task has been twofold, (a) the sifting of existing material, (b) the provision of new material.

  We have tried to retain as much as possible of the older material; but it is has not been possible always. The main reason is that the present system of government is vastly different from what existed before. It is different from the Vedic, Buddhist, Gupta or Mughal days. The very conceptions lying under the present system are new. The distinctions that today exist between tax **कर** and cess **उपकर**, law विधि and act **अधिनियम**, attorney **प्राभिकर्ता** and agent **अभिकर्ता**, right अधिकार and authority प्राधिकार, privilege **विशेषाधिकार** and prerogative **परमाधिकार**, invention **उपज्ञा** and discovery **आविष्कार**, legislation **विधान**and constitution **संविधान**have been maintained by using distinct terms.

  An example of terms denoting official hierarchy is the series composed of grades of secretaries—

Secretary **सचिव**

additional secretary **अपर सचिव**  
deputy secretary **प्रति-सचिव**  
under secretary **अवर सचिव, उप-सचिव**  
chief secretary **मुख्य सचिव**  
joint secretary **संयुक्त सचिव**  
assistant secretary **सहायक सचिव**  
extra-secretary **अतिरिक्त सचिव**

  Oft-used phrases have been freely incorporated the Dictionary. It is hoped that they will be a greathelp.

  Accounts and book-keeping form an important of administration. Some of the basic words are given hereunder as example :

bank **अधिकोष**

commercial bank **वाणिज्य-अधिकोष**  
co-operative bank **सहकारी अधिकोष**  
exchange bank **विनिमय-अधिकोष**  
industrial bank **औद्योगिक अधिकोष**  
savings bank **संचय-अधिकोष**  
bankable **अधिकोषणीय**  
banker **अधिकोष-पति, आधिकौषिक**  
banking **अधिकोषण, अधिकोष-व्यापार**  
banking account **अधिकोषण-लेखा**  
banking advisor **अधिकोषण-मन्त्रणाकार**

register *n.* **पञ्जी**

register *vb.* **पञ्जीयन, पञ्जीबद्ध करना, निबन्धन**  
registered **पञ्जीयन, पञ्जीबद्ध, निबद्ध**

registration fees **पञ्जीयन-शुल्क**  
registration ink **पञ्जीयन-मसी**  
registration law and procedure **पञ्जीयन विधि और प्रक्रिया**  
Registration Manual **पञ्जीयन-नियमावलि**  
registration mark **पञ्जीयन-चिह्न**

  Examples for terms relating to constitution, law, administration, economics, politics and allied branches would be found to be mostly transparent.

**LOGIC**

Logic is the science that deals with the canons and criteria of validity in thought and demonstration; the science of the normative formal principles of reasoning.

 Traditionally, Western logic comprises (1) the "doctrine of terms", the principles of definition, classification and the correct use of terms; (2) the "doctrine of the judgment", or principles of correct predication; (3) the "doctrine of inference", covering reasoning or demonstration proper.

 Logicians are divided in their conceptions of the content and significance of logic.

 Logic as taught today in our universities mainly represents—

 (1) Aristotelian logic, derived from Aristotle and the Stoics and followed by most other European logicians until at least the time of Hegel. This logic is most authoritatively set forth in the Port Royal Logic. It is principally concerned with deduction. For induction we have to go to J. S. Mill.

 (2) Modern or epistemological logic derived from Hegel. It is perhaps best represented in its current form by Bosanquet. It conceives all truth to be organically related and tested by its coherence, so that nothing short of the whole of the truth can be wholly true. Conceptions and principles are inadequate in proportion as they are abstract, and a correct canon of right thinking cannot be formal.

 (3) Pragmatic, instrumental, or experimental logic, of John Dewey and his followers. It emphasizes thinking as an activity whereby the individual adapts himself to the environment, and the art of thinking which logic treats as concerned principally with this instrumental value of thought. It largely ignores formal principles.

 (4) Symbolic or mathematical logic, which is a mode of developing and representing logical principles through the use of symbols for classes, propositions etc., rather than a theory of logic.

 Psychological logic or psychologism, represents a movement, confined to Germany. It would substitute psychological and descriptive laws of thought for the usual normative principles.

 Ancient Indian logic represents a different world altogether. It is not possible to cover European conceptions by the terms of Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika, Vedānta or Jains and Buddhists. A new set of terms has to be evolved.

 There are, however, a number of ancient terms which have been brought into service, such as,

 तर्क, युक्ति, हेतु, कारण, कार्य, कारणता, कारणत्व, कार्य-कारण-सम्बन्ध, निमित्त-कारण, समवायि-कारण, अन्वय, व्यतिरेक, पदार्थ, द्रव्य, अतिव्याप्त, अव्याप्त, पुनरुक्ति, अवच्छेदक, माध्य, पक्ष, व्याघात, निरुपाधिक, सोपाधिक, सामान्य, विशेष, विकल्प, वाद, अवयव, विशेषण, विशेषक, अपवाद, अनुमान, व्यवहित, अव्यवहित, विपर्यय, तादात्म्य, विलोम-सम्बन्ध, विभावना.

 काकतालीय is the Indian counterpart of *post hoc, ergo propter hoc*.

 "Fallacy" is Latin *fallacia* from *fallax* meaning "deceptive or false appearance". Ancient आभास is "semblance, mere appearance, fallacious appearance" (वेदान्तसार). हेत्वाभास is just one type of आभास. There are others, e. g., तर्काभास, प्रमाणाभास, न्यायाभास (हेत्वाभास इत्यादौ हेतुदोषः। अत्र हेतावाभासत इति व्युत्पत्त्याआभासपदं हेतुनिष्ठदोषपरमिति ज्ञेयम्)

 Biologically species is जाति—समान-प्रसवा जातिः"that which brings forth प्रसव its like समान".

 For deduction, निगमन has been used for some time past. We have accepted it, नि "down", गमन "going", i.e. inferring the particular from the general (सामान्याद्विशेषस्य अनुमानम्). It is the fifth member in the system of the Naiyāyikas (प्रतिज्ञा, हेतु, उदाहरण, उपनय, निगमन. "निगमन is the summing up of an argument or conclusion in a syllogism; deduction" M. Monier-Williams). निगमन "deduction" has its natural counterpart in उद्गमन "induction", inferring the general from the particular (विशेषात् सामान्यस्य अनुमानम्).

 वाक्य in ancient logic is used for "member of a syllogism" or "syllogism" itself. For "member of a syllogism" अवयव has found wide acceptance. It has the backing of न्यायदर्शन. For "syllogism" we have prefixed सं to वाक्य; corresponding to *syi*- the *sandhi* form of *syn*- "with" in *syl-logism*. वाक्य by itself wouldbe "sentence". तर्क-वाक्य can be an alternative.

 For *equivocation* the ancient term is वाक्छलम्अविशेषाभिहितेऽर्थे वक्तुरभिप्रायाद् अर्थान्तरकल्पना वाक्छलम् (न्यायदर्शने १॥२॥१२) \।
नवकम्बलोऽयं माणवक इति प्रयोगः । अत्र नवः कम्बलोऽस्य इति वक्तुरभिप्रायः । विग्रहे तु विशेषो न समासे । तत्रायं छलवादी वक्तुरभिप्रायाद् अविवक्षितम् अन्यम् अर्थं नव कम्बला अस्येति तावद्अभिहितं भवता इति कल्पयति । कल्पयित्वा चासंभवेन प्रतिषेधति एकोऽस्य कम्बलः कुतो नव कम्बला इति । तदिदं सामान्यशब्दे वाचि छलं वाक्छलमिति (वात्स्यायनकृते गौतमसूत्रभाष्ये१॥२॥१२).

 In point of clarity the Indianterms would be found to be superior to English. To take a typical set— (1) logical division (2) physical partition (3) metaphysical analysis. Here the first is the division of genus into species जाति— जाति-विभाजन; the second is the division of an object into its parts, as of a tree into roots, branches, etc.—अवयव-विभाजन; the third is the division of a substance into qualities, as of sugar into sweetness, whiteness, etc.—गुण-विभाजन.

 Distinction and close relation have been maintained between terms of similar significance-

|                         |          |
|:-----------------------:|:--------:|
| figure (of a syllogism) |  प्रकार  |
|          modus          | प्रकारक  |
|          mood           | उपप्रकार |

 अस्ति, present tense, third person, singular form of root अस् “to be, to exist", has been used in compounds in ancient literature with great effect—

 अस्ति इति तिङन्तक्रियावचन-प्रतिरूपको निपातः । अस्तिशब्दश्चायं निपातस् त्रिकालविषयः । यदाह शाकटायनःन्यासकृत्—अस्तीति निपातः सर्वलिङ्गवचनेष्विति—इत्यभिधानराजेन्द्रे ॥

 अस्ति-काय, an ontological category among the Jains, of which five are distinguished, viz., जीवास्ति- काय, अजीवास्ति-काय, धर्मास्ति-काय, अधर्मास्ति काय, पुद्गलास्ति-काय.

 अस्ति-क्षीरा is "one having milk" (काशिका on पाणिनि २/२/२४ सुबधिकारेऽस्तिक्षीरादीनां बहुव्रीहिर्वक्तव्यः).

 अस्तिता, अस्तित्व " existence, reality" (सर्वदर्शनसंग्रह, etc.).

 अस्ति-नास्ति “partly true, partly not, doubtful”.

 अस्ति प्रवाद, अस्ति-नास्ति-प्रवाद—name of the fourth of the fourteen older writings of the Jains.

 अत्थि-भाव (Skt. अस्ति-भाव) "state of being, existence, being" is widely current in Pali books (Jātaka I. 222, 290; II.415; etc.)–अत्थि-भाव वा नत्थि-भाव वा “whether there is or not".

 अस्तिमत् "possessed of property, those who have, haves” (correspondingly we can use नास्तिमत् "have- and in plural, “haves and havesnot" अस्तिमन्तोनास्तिमन्तः).

 आस्तेय "belonging to something existent"—पाणिनि ५६ दृति-कुक्षि-कलशि-वस्ति-अस्ति-अहेर् ढञ् ॥

 Alongside अस्ति- we have नास्ति- —नास्तिता, नास्तित्व “nonexistence” (शंकराचार्य), नास्ति-मूर्ति “incorporeal" (नैषधचरित), नास्ति-वाद "atheism" (हरिवंश, etc.).

 नास्तिक “an atheist", आस्तिक “a believer" are well-known.

 From अस्मि are similarly derived अस्मिता, अस्मि मान-

 From स्यात् is derived स्याद्-वाद, स्याद्-वादिक, स्याद्-वादिन् (स्याद् इत्यव्ययं तिङन्तप्रतिरूपकं कथंचिदर्थकम् । स्यादस्ति कथं-चिदस्ति इत्यर्थः—शारीरकभाष्यटीकायाम् २\।२\।३३).

 From अस्तु, कात्यायन (अस्तु-सत्य-अगदस्य कार इति वक्तव्यम् on पाणिनि ६\।३\।७०) derives अस्तुंकार “one who says अस्तु, conceding, assenting unwillingly, or ordering".

 अस्तु-विद् “knowing that anything must be done" (कल्हण-कृता राजतरंगिणी).

 Thus the use of अस्ति, नास्ति and other verbal forms as nouns which enter into compounds, and which take *taddhita* suffixes, is well authenticated by grammarians, philosophers and literati (cf. काशिका ४\।३\।५६ आस्तेयम् । अस्तिशब्दःप्रातिपदिकं न तिङन्तः)

 Hence for *affirmative* we have अस्ति-वाची, for *negative* नास्ति-वाची. *Universal affirmative* is सामान्य अस्तिवाची, *particular affirmative* विशेष अस्तिवाची.

 A, the first letter of Latin *affirmo*, denoting a universal affirmative, has its counterpart in our अ, the initial of अस्ति-वाची. E, the first vowel of Latin *nego*, denoting a universal negative, is translated by our न, the initial of नास्ति-वाची. अ and न, standing for universal affirmative and negative respectively, आ and ना have been used to serve for particular affirmative and negative.

 Three more abbreviations may be noted here-

|               |                |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|
|  S (subject)  | उ ( उद्देश्य ) |
| P (predicate) |   वि (विधेय)   |
|  M (middle)   |    म (मध्य)    |

 There are numerous Latin phrases, sentences and maxims in Western logic. Usually it has been possible to translate them by words, juxtaposed to form compounds, usable in Hindi, Marathi or any other Indian language, either as standing alone or as part of a sentence. There, however, remain a few of them, where compounds cannot serve the purpose, for the relationship of one word with another has to be exhibited by the proper case-ending, or if it is a complete sentence, with its subject, object, and finite verb, all with or without adjuncts. In such cases we have resorted to Sanskrit, as India's superfine medium of expressing laws and maxims in the clearest and the most compact form. They will be common to Hindi, Marathi and other languages of India. If, however, need be felt, they are simple enough to be translated further into the mother-tongue of the student. It is only the Sanskrit case-endings which have to be replaced, the words shall remainthe same, e. g. *Causa latet*, *vis est notissima* कारणम् अदृश्यं, दृश्यं कार्यम्.

**SCIENTIFIC SYMBOLOGY**

 Formulas are made up of, in great measure, signs and symbols. They represent a vocal and graphic economy which was unthinkable two centuries ago. They are abstractions representing the top of the flight of steps on one's ascension in a particular domain. They condense knowledge.

 Formulas may be constitutional, configurational or stereometric, electronic, mathematical, etc. Thereis hardly any science which does not make use of formulas. They are the modern counterparts of ancient *sū**tras*, expressing a general fact, a rule or principle, a statement covering complexities of facts and situations, a brief expression of a single concept or again, as in chemistry, the composition of a substance.

 Signs and symbols are the bricks of a formula. They may be classified as hereunder :-  
<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1693475486Untitled1.jpg"/>  
 A, b, c, d and *alpha, beta, gamma* are alphabetic symbols, the first set derived from Roman and the second from Greek. They can be used as capitals, smalls and italics. They may be used singly or in combinations. They may be the initials of full words as in chemistry, physics and elsewhere. They may as well represent the number which they occupy in their respective alphabets, as in astronomy, where the magnitude of stars is expressed by the letters of the Greek alphabet instead of the usual numbers 1, 2, 3, *alpha*standing for 1, *beta* for 2 and so on.

 Then there are non-alphabetic symbols. They are not as many as the alphabetic ones, but they are important and are frequently met with. In mathematics alone, there are a few dozens of them comprising dots, dashes, accents, circles, half-circles, triangles, squares, rectangles, parallelograms, right angles, perpendiculars, parallels, arbitrary signs for infinity, equal to, equiangular to, parallel to, plus, minus, multiplied by, divided by, is contradictory of, is greater than, is less than, is not less than, is not greater than, is congruent to, is identical with, is similarly ordered, therefore, of the form of, is divisible by, varies directly as, is proportional to, the ratio of, geometric proportion, the root sign, etc., etc.

 Alphabetic and non-alphabetic symbols are combined. \।\।^(GM) for parallelogram is a diagrammatico-alphabetic symbol.

 When one considers the transmission of knowledge from one language to another, it is not the diagrammatic symbols that concern the transmitter of knowledge, for they remain the same, but the alphabet symbols. They concern the script and the language directly and inseparably.

 The English script is the Roman script and the Roman is in its turn derived from Greek and retains great affinity to it. Latin and Greek are also the classical languages wherefrom English derives its sustenance in matters of literary and scientific expression. We, on the other hand, have our own scripts the Devanagari,Bengali, Tamil, etc, which are derivatives of the Ashokan Brahmi,

 The Indian scripts follow a different pattern and they are equally inseparably associated in the Indian consciousness with Indian languages. Both our public and printers find it convenient to use our letters of the alphabet in the body of our own language texts. Nothing else can be practical either.

 English alphabetic symbols lead on to English words, whether hypertechnical, technical, semitechnical, or even non-technical.These cannot be absorbed without absorbing English words. One might cite such symbols from English as *Ag* for silver, *Au* for gold, and argue that a symbol is just a symbol and need not be intelligible. On examination, it will be found that no student of science is ignorant of the original words *argentum* and *aurum*. Those who use *Ag* and *Au* also use argentic, argentous, auric, aurous, etc., etc. While there may be here and there an occasional symbol which has lost its connection with the original word in the memory of the users, there are against it hundreds which are abbreviations of current words. Symbols being abbreviations, it becomes impossible to borrow them from English into our languages. Moreover unlike our scripts English words are graphically based on spellings and not on pronunciation (the two playing a game of hide and seek).

 To give a few examples: *h* stands for *h*our, *r* for *r*adius, *f* for *f*unction, *M* for *m*odulus of a system of logarithm, *c.g*- stands for *c*entre of *g*ravity. One letter may stand and does actually stand for many words, e.g., *c* (sometimes capital) stands for carbon, chemical constant, concentration, Curie's cons (in physical chemistry), coulomb, canine teeth, capacity (in electricity), cathode, cent, centre, centime, centigrade, centimeter, centum, cervical, cubic (in volumetry), etc., etc.

 According to the principle of virtual displacement

F_(₁) = m_(₁)g + R_(₁) + T  
F_(₂) = m_(₂)g + R_(₂) + T  
and (m_(₁)g + R_(₁) +T) dr_(₁) + (m_(₂)g + R_(₂) + T) dr_(₂) = 0

Here m stands for mass,

F for force,  
g for gravitational constant,  
R for reaction,  
T for tension,  
d in dr for displacement,

and r in dr for radius vector.

Let us take some simpler formulae—  
(a) W = mg

Here W stands for weight, m for mass and g for gravitational constant.

(b) momentum = *mv*,  
where*m* is the mass, and *v* isthe velocity of the particle.

 With our own terms we shall naturally use our own abbreviated symbols in our own script. Through our symbols, our men shall reach the words for which they stand and vice versa. They can make their abbreviations not only for the present, but in the future also. This backward and forward movement is not possible if we should be so inconsiderate as to attempt to have either foreign alphabetic symbols or foreign words or both, using throughout our own script or confining our script to non-scientific terms and symbols. The typographical discord and the intellectual confusion that will result, will benefit no one.

 Let us look at abbreviations from the graphic and vocal points of view. From the graphic view, a single graphic unit is a better abbreviation than two graphic units. Our script allows one, two or three consonants and a vowel, i.e. a syllable to be the graphic unit. Hence we have a vast variety of single graphic unit symbols. In English, the scope is restricted to small, capital and italic, Greek and Roman letters, all told a few scores. In our case, they are a few thousand.

 In English and other European languages the graphic unit is a letter, i.e., either a consonant or a vowel. For distinction, it is usual to have beside the initial letter another medial or final letter. This use of di-, tri-, or poly-literal abbreviations leads to two, three or more graphic units.

 Vocally, our abbreviations are mono-syllabic. In English too the mono-literal graphic unit is vocally a mono-syllable. One cannot pronounce anything less than a syllable. But in the case of poly-literal abbreviations, the Englishman usually has to pronounce as many syllables as letters (particularly when they are formed of consonants only). Our graphic and vocal unit being the syllable, we rarely require poly-syllabic abbreviations.

 In the case of syncopates (e.g. 'ackgt.' standingfor acknowledgement, 'advtg.' for advertising), there is graphic economy but no vocal economy.

 In English the distinction between smalls, capitals and italics is graphic and not vocal, unless one should prefix to every symbol, the word capital, small, or italic.

 Scientific language and scientific symbols form one integral whole, just as the administrative language and administrative symbols form another integral whole. To anyone who would go far and deep enough, the unitary aspect of words and their alphabetic symbols would seem axiomatic. The few exceptions only fortify its paramountcy and unchallengeability.

 In India abbreviations have been used as names from the most ancient times. In the Vedic literature a hymn, which is a collection of mantras, is often designated by its opening word or words नासदीयसूक्त of the Ṛigveda is well-known (नासदीय'that which begins with the two words न असद्'). Similarly यज्ञायज्ञीयसामdesignates the mantra यज्ञायज्ञा वो अग्नये गिरागिरा च दक्षसे । प्रप्र वयममृतं जातवेदसं प्रियं मित्रं न शंसिषम्.

 In the Sāma Veda we find that numbers play an important part in the musical notation along with signs and letters of alphabet.

 The superscript letters and numbers used in Sāma Veda are the earliest precursors of the modern usage of superscript and subscript letters and numbers.

 ईशोपनिषत् and केनोपनिषत् are derived from the opening words ईशा and केन respectively. The first chapter of Caraka Saṃhitā, the oldest Indian treatise on medicine, begins with दीर्घं जीवितम् अन्विच्छन् भरद्वाज उपागमत् and is hence named दीर्घञ्जीवितीयम्; so also many other chapters.

 In music the seven notes are स (षड्ज, ष being popularly pronounced as स), रि (ऋषभ, ऋ is popularly pronounced as रि or रु), ग (गन्धार), म (मध्यम), प(पञ्चम), ध (धैवत), नि (निषाद).

 In prosody a light syllable is known as ल (लघु) and a heavy one as ग (गुरु).

 Sanskrit manuscripts show regular abbreviations of the titles which are repeated on every folio. It would be a fascinating study to make a collection of all the symbols and notations used therein. It would go up to hundreds.

 Abbreviations and symbols were also made the basis of a mystic language, the language of Buddhist and Śaiva Tantric ritual, magic and thought. These symbols spread over the entire length and breadth of India and from here they migrated to the farthest limits of the East Indies and beyond the Himalayas into Tibet, Central Asia, Mongolia, China, Korea and Japan. In the Buddhist manuscripts recently exhumed in Gilgit a धारणी runs as follows: वृ वृ वृद्धिकरि \। धृ धृ धृतकरि। यु यु आयुप्पालनि । (Vol. I, p. 74). Uddhārakosha, which is an ancient dictionary of the secret monosyllabic code of the Śaivas of North India, provides many such instances: इ (इन्द्र), घ्नीं (शतघ्नी), द्रां or द्रीं (चन्द्र), म (मण्डूक), छ (शनि, mark the deterioration of श to छ in the popular speech), ब (वीचि), ञ or ञं (यम, phonetically a most interesting instance of ञ pronounced as a nasalised य-). ह्लीं is a combination of ह sky+ल darkness (काल) denoting *fine dust* ('that darkens the sky'). The pure nasal अनुस्वार is here and in many other instances the counterpart of the modern period (.), which marks an abbreviation, though it would be idle to dogmatise that the ancients were as conscious as we of this particular value of the अनुस्वार.

 It is not only technical men who used abbreviations, but even literary men found occasion to use them; and among our lexicons a special genre known as एकाक्षर-कोष was devoted entirely to them. For example: अ (अङ्गन, अन्तःपुर), ए (एकादशसंख्या, ए being the eleventh letter, so that अ is 1), अं (अंजलि), क (काय, काल, केका, कामग्रन्थि), कु (कुत्सा, used as a prefix), च (चपल, चोर, चन्द्र), छ (अच्छ clean,  
pure, छादन), ज (जव, जय, जेतृ, ज्योति), झ (झञ्झानिल), ड ( डर fear, डमरुक, जड), डा (डाकिनी), ढ (गाढ, ढक्का, गूढ़), त (अमृत, तर, तार), ता ('धातुवादविधौ', शाश्वतकोष ७५.३९), थ (पृथुल, नाथ), ध (धन, धान्य, बुद्धि, इन्द्रध्वनि, ध्यान, धन्वन्तरि), फ (शोफ, स्फार), ब (बुद्धि), भ (भ्रमर, भाव), य (वायु, यम), या (ज्या), र (राजभय, रुधिर), ल (लवन, ह्लादन, तैल), वि (व्योम, वैराग्य), म (सर्प- स्यन्दनपथ).

 Panini, the greatest codifier of language, has employed a system known as प्रत्याहार,composed of the initial syllable and the final consonant of a series which is thus encompassed and designated by it. According to Pāṇini names can be shortened—देवदत्त to देव or दत्त,षडंगुलिदत्त to षडिक, सुपर्थ्याशीर्दत्त to सुपरिय.

 As symbols, Devanagari letters afford greater variety, and that just because it is a syllabic script while the European has to be content with 26 letters of the Roman alphabet or their double 52 (making use of the capitals). Add to them the 24 letters of the Greek alphabet (only a few of the capitals have been used). He crosses some of his letters as an L or an S or an R to denote a pound, or a dollar or a recipe in medicine.

 At our disposal we have got for purposes of symbols and abbreviations 14 vowels (including short and long ऋ and लृ). Our consonants are 33. Every consonant can have 14 simple syllables by way of vowels. The fourteen can be tripled by getting two more sets, one with the superscript *anusvara*, another with the side-script *visarga*. Thus the capacity of Devanagari is tremendous. It beats the Roman hollow and leaves it far behind. Whatever appendages in the form of diacritical, specificatory or correlating marks, e. g. dots, dashes, strokes, circlets, are employed by the Roman are just as well at our disposal. They use italics, so can we. They use letters as numbers, so have we done in the past and are doing in the present.

 For correlation, different forms of the same letter have to be used sometimes. There Roman and Greek combined are able to muster together three e.g. A a *a*, B b *β*; or four G g T y; or only two when the Greek is absent C c. Instead we have whole series क का कि की ... कंकां कि कीं... कः काः किःकीः ...

 For graph work where a certain position has to be denoted by reference to horizontal and vertical grades, it is of the greatest convenience to mark one set by vowels and the other by consonants. Thus a particular position in the graph would be कि or जे etc.

 Thus in following up the modern scientific symbols and abbreviations and providing for them in the Indian languages, we have at our back a solid tradition which serves as our foundation and leads us on smoothly. Not for a moment are we allowed to feel that we are treading on foreign terrain.

**Indian Counterparts of Greek and Roman Letters  
of the Alphabet**

 Letters of the alphabet are sometimes used to indicate anyone or anything arbitrarily or conveniently so designated; specifically with quasinumerical force A meaning first, B second, C third, etc.,*Ω* last), as in distinguishing successive stages in the disintegration of radioactive elements.

 Greek letters are even more frequently used with numerical significance (in order of their sequence in the Greek alphabet, not as Greek numerals), to express serial arrangement or position; to distinguish between allotropic forms of certain elements (cf. alpha iron, beta iron, gamma iron); to distinguish between isomers or modifications and to indicate the positionof substituting groups in certain compounds.

 We have allotted two separate sets of Indian letters to represent the Greek and Roman alphabets.

 Greek and Roman letters have names: alpha, gamma, etc. These are uniformly translatable by the addition of -कार or वर्ण —alpha अकार (अवर्ण), gamma इकार (इवर्ण).

**Forms of Letters**

 Some shapes and forms derive their names in English from capital letters of the alphabet, e.g., A (A-tent), T (T-tube). Our own alphabets, from Hindi up to Singhalese, are too ornamental for the purpose. In our search for simpler forms that would be serviceable (and authentic), we have arrived at Brahmi, which in the days of Ashoka, the greatest of great emperors, prevailed from the Himachala to the Malayachala. It is a simple script, as simple as the sans-serif Roman (English) capitals. Brahmi, the Indian alphabet par excellence, is the mother of all alphabets of India as well as of countries influenced by her, such as Ceylon to the south; Burma, Siam, Cambodia (कम्बोज), Malay archipelago to the east and south-east; Tibet to the north. Brahmi is the mother of a myriad scripts that are now lost in the sands of Central Asia, Mongolia and elsewhere. Traces of an Indian script have been discovered by Japanese scholars in Philippines. Sanskrit inscriptions are available as far as East Borneo, Brahmi has served the Aryans, the Dravidians, the Mongolians and the Turks for long periods and over wide expanses. It is the most scientific of the scripts of our globe, one symbol serving for one sound, every sound having aseparate symbol, arranged and classified in a true phonetic system, musical and complete. In short, Brahmi is the pride and glory of India.

 We reproduce below some of the Brahmi forms. Devanagari letters are put above them. In cases of resemblance English letters are noted below.

<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1693050666RBB.jpg"/>

 We had occasion to use some of the Brahmi syllables, e.g. रो for T (in T-tube). For clarity the wordब्राह्म may-be prefixed, e.g., T= ब्राह्म रो.  
 It will be observed that Brahmi covers many forms than does the Roman, and that they can be utilised with perfect ease. It is, of course, expected that every Indian student will familiarize himself with the script that is the progenitor of his own.

Corresponding Greek letters *** ** *** *        **

[TABLE]

(1) In the case of sides and angles of a triangle in plane and spherical trigonometry angles shall be denoted by अकारान्त consonants and the opposite or corresponding sides by the corresponding आकारान्त letters.

*e.g*$\\frac{Sin\~A}{a}$=$\\frac{Sin\~B}{b}$=$\\frac{Sin\~C}{c}$would be  
$\\frac{{ज्या}\~क}{का}$=$\\frac{{ज्या}\~ख}{खा}$=$\\frac{{ज्या}\~ग}{गा}$

 Where small letters and related capital letters occur together in English, the general arrangement should be followed.

*e.g. ax + by + c = 0 *क य + ख र + ग= ०  
*Ax+By+C =0     * का य + खा र +गा= ०  
*Pp+Qq+Rr=0*      ता त + था थ + दाद= ०

(2) In naming figures, where capital letters are used in English, the points should be denoted by अकारान्त consonants, choosing groups from the above table as far as possible.  
(3)ब, the first letter of बिन्दु, is recommended as the substitute for P, the point.  
(4) म, the first letter of मूलबिन्दु, should be used for O, the origin.

The radius vector OP will thus be represented by म ब.

(5) The symbol for the number *π* equal to 3.1416... will be प्या, since *π*=$\\frac{परिधि}{व्यास}$,the conjunct consonant ending in long आ being necessary to give it a distinctive sound.  
(6) For small *r*== radius vector, त्र shall be used, being the significant consonant in (सदिश) त्रिज्या.  
(7) *p* will be represented by त्रि; being the first letterof त्रिज्य,the radius of curvature.  
(8) *r,* *θ*,*Φ* coordinate system will be त्र,ऊ,ए.  
(9) *s*,*ψ* pedal coordinates will be ध,ऐ.  
(10) *n* as any number will be represented by स of (कापि) सङ्ख्या.  
(11)*r* or *t used as a represented term will be* न (निरूपित पद).  
(12)*r* as a running term will be ध (धावी पद).  
(13) *e* as the exponential will be represented by घा (abbreviated from घात) so that *e^(x)* is घा^(य).  
(14) The Cartesian coordinates *x, y, z* will be य,र,ल.  
(15) The letter म does not come anywhere in the serial order (Table II). It is, therefore,

available for being used as an unspecified general constant.

(16) Other symbols required in mathematies will be abbreviations for which the general rule tobe followed is to select the first consonant with the vowel or the first vowel, dropping the उपसर्ग. In the case of a compound word, the abbreviation is to be taken from the more significant member of the compound.

(17) *e*^(x)read as *e* to the power *x* will be घा^(य)

(19)Σwill be यread as योग ध सम शून्य यात्रत् ध  
   r = o   ध= ०

सम स.  
(20) In the above the letterय has been used as an abbreviation of योगto represent summationfor which Σis used in English. The written symbol य is to be read as योग.

(21) *x* = log_(ba) will be य = छे_(ख)क read as य सम छेदा क आधार ख.  
(22) Napierian log will be घ छेदा meaning छेदा आधार घ and log will beछेदा, for which the symbolwill be छे.

Symbols used in Physics\*

The symbols used in physics are usually abbreviations of words for which they stand, e. g. a for Acceleration and Amplitude, c for Candle power, Capacity, Centigrade and Current, d for Density and Distance, e for Electronic charge, g for Gram, etc. The. English language has no more than 26 letters, and 26 is too small a number. Hence some of the Greek letters are brought into service, e. g. having employed e for Electronic charge, epsilon is employed for Electrode.Another, equally arbitrary usage is that of small and capital letters, e. g. small m stands for Magnification, while the capital M is for Magnetic movement or Magnifying power. The usage may differ from book to book, e.g. for mass one may use either the small or the capi-  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
\* *भौतिकी 'physics' stands for भौतिकी विद्या. It is anadnoun from भूत (as in पञ्चभूत or भूतद्रव्य which are common terms for matter). भौतिकी विद्या or simply भौतिकी is the science of matter or more technically the science which deals with phenomena of (inanimate) matter involving no changes in chemical composition or more specifically with the most general and fundamental of such phenomena, namely motion. भूतद्रव्यविद्या, भौतिकपदार्थविज्ञान or पदार्थविज्ञान are other terms which are used for physics inHindi, Bengali and other languages. But भौतिकी has, the advantage of being a single, compact word which ismore amenable to derivational formations than thelonger compound words (see further, note on naming ofsciences).*

 The symbol is usually the initial graphic unit, inRoman script a single letter ofthe alphabet, in Devanagari a vowel, or one or two consonants with a vowel. In Devanagari the graphic unit may be simplified, e. g., पfor पुं of पुंजांक 'mass number', or instead of the initialgraphic unit, the second may be used, particularlywhen the first syllable is an oft-used prefix, e.g., चू for प्रof प्रचूषण-शक्ति ‛absorptive power'.

 When pronounced a symbol forms a singlesyllable.

 While in English the symbols are limited by thecount of letters in Roman and Greek alphabets, the initial graphic units in Devanagari are numberless. Thatlends greater richness and clarity to the Indian symbols.

**WEIGHTS AND MEASURES**

**The Greeks had no numbers beyond the *myriad*"ten thousand"** (10⁴)**, while the Romans did not gobeyond *mille* "one thousand"** (10³)**. The English word*million* is from Italian *millione*, augmentative from *mille*"thousand". In India our ancestors dealt freely with noless than eighteen denominations, and gave them specificnames. In Lalitavistara, a biography of Lord Buddha,numbers go up to 10⁵³! शीर्षप्रहेलिका a period of timeamong the Jains, occupies 194 notational places!!**

**As is well known, the decimal place value systemis an Indian invention and it is from here that thesystemhas spread to the whole world. Hence we are quite athome in dealing with the metric system. दश, शत, सहस्र,अयुत\*, लक्ष and प्रयुत are single words and can be usedsimply and unambiguously.**

**Meter is from Latin *mensus* to measure, akin toGreck *metron* a measure, ultimately from Sanskrit$\\sqrt{}$मा to meausre. In English meter has two senses: (1) Thatwhich measures, an instrument or an apparatus, e.g. barometer, thermometer. In this sense it is usually a suffix. (2) A unit of length. Its Indian counterpart is मान. Asa suffix it has been used in वर्षमान** (कौटल्य अर्थशास्त्र) **'an instrument for measuring rainfall'. When standing by it self it has been used as a general word expressing measure as well as particular measures, e.g. accordingto the commentator of तैत्तिरीयसंहिताand कात्यायनश्रौतसूत्र100 मानऽ make 5 पलऽ or पणऽ.**

**The word मान can be made to cover both theusage of meter, viz.,** (1) **मानmeter as the unit of length,and (2) मान as a suffix denoting a measuring instrument,e.g. तापमान thermometer.**

**Meter is subdivided into decimeter, centimeter,millimeter, etc. Their Indian equivalents would beदशिमान, शतिमान, सहस्रिमान, etc. Similarly for decameter,hectometer, kilometer, etc., which are its multiples, theIndian equivalents would be दशमान, शतमान, सहस्रमान, etc.**

**In weights and capacity measures we had greatvariety in the past. After long search we have beenable to select out of these a series which can serve as thebasis for the formation of modern English terminology.Even a cursory glance at the two sets, the ancient Indianand the modern English, will convince the reader thatthe English system is largely Indian, from the grain upto the ton. The weights are usually multiples of two**(2, 2², 2³, 2⁴, 2⁵, 2⁶)**, with an occasional multiple or three or five. The starting point is यव, which is no more and no less than a grain. 180 यवऽ make one told. The present day Indian Government or Railway *seer***

***————————————————————————————————————————***  
***\*दश सहस्र and दश-लक्ष are the prevalent names now adays. But अयुत(10,000) **and प्रयुत** (million) **are simplerand easier to use in compounds. Fortunately प्रयुतisone of those few higher numbers whose value is fairlyconstant right up from the यजुर्वेद** (१७.२)**, तैत्तिरीयसंहिता**(४.४०. ११. ४, ७. २. २०. १)**, पञ्चविंशब्राह्मण and शांखायनश्रौत down to Āryabhaṭa I** (499 A. D.)**, Śrīdhara (750 A, D.), Bh**ā**skara II** (1150 A. D.)**, etc.***

80 *tolas;* one *tola*being exactly 180 grains (see also Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language, 1934, s.v. *ser*).

 **माष** is in use already. Hence it is not used. धान्य, which is another name for माष,[^2] is 15 यवऽ, just as one gram is 15 grains (15.432356). Hence धान्यbecomes the basis of the metric system of weights.

[^2]: "The goldsmith s माष of 15 यवऽ is slightly different, being 17 grains troy."

 **प्रस्थ** is our unit of capacity measures since times immemorial. It is the counterpart of the modern liter. In Webster its value has been worked out to be 1.03 liters.

 **पाद** foot. पद and पाद both mean foot. The English word is historically a descendant of the Sanskrit word. As a measure पाद has been used in the शतपथब्राह्मण, in the श्रौतसूत्रऽand elsewhere. Like all other measures in ancient times it must have varied slightly from place to place. There are two measurements given for पाद, one is 12 अंगुलऽ and the other is 15 अंगुलऽ (कात्यायनश्रौतसूत्र). The second measurement is approximately $11\\frac{1}{4}\\operatorname{''}$.In modern times the foot is a fixed measurement of 12 inches. It was used extensively for measuring land. On the European Continent, the foot, now largely replaced by metric units, varies locally between 11 and 14 inches. It is interesting to note that as in India the पाद was subdivided into 12 angulas so in the English system also the foot is subdivided into 12 parts, the inches. Only an inch is slightly longer than an अंगुल (and hence our word प्रांगुलfor inch). An inch was originally divided into three parts called barley corns, whose length was declared by a statute apparently of 17 Edw. II given in the Cottonian Manuscripts (Claudius D. 2) to be that of 'three grains of barley, dry and round', placed end to end lengthwise.

 Originally क्रोश is the range of the voice in calling or hallooing. In ancient literature क्रोश is equal to one thousand दण्डऽ or four thousand हस्तऽ (हस्त cubit). हस्त is the fore-arm from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger and is equal to twenty-four अंगुलऽ or eighteen inches. Thus a क्रोशis six thousand feet as against 5280 feet of the English mile. As a mile is shorterthan a क्रोश,-क is added to क्रोशto signifydiminution.

 Just as the Indian क्रोश is formed of one thousand दण्डऽ so the English mile is originally one thousand paces.

 'Mile' is from Latin *milia, millia,* plural of *mille* a thousand, i.e. *milia passuum*'a thousand paces'. *Mille*is akin to Sanskrit मेला 'multitude, a large number'. Mile has changed from time to time and place to place. The ancient Roman mile was about one thousand six hundred and twenty English yards, while the old Scotch mile was 1.123 and the Irish mile 1.273 statute miles. On the Continent the old miles which have been replaced officially at least by the kilometer, varied from about 11 hundred yards to over 12 hundred yards. The geographical, nautical or sea mile is the length of a minute or 21,600, of a great circle of the earth. According to the value adopted by the British Hydrographic Office, it is six thousand eighty feet and is called the Admiralty mile.The Roman *passus* was from the heel of one foot to the heel of the same foot when it next touched the ground, making five Roman feet. This has to be compared with the Punjab *karam*(Sanskrit क्रम) which is also 5 feet and is commonly in use among the villagers.

 **नल्वand क्रोश** are shorter than furlong and league respectively. Hence furlong is प्रणल्वand league is प्रकोश.

 In liquid measures start is made with प्रसृति, -our counterpart of gill.

४ प्रसृति = शराव  
८ शराव = आढक  
६४ आढक = खारी

 The same relationship is shown by the English measures :

4 gills = pint  
8 pints = gallon  
63 gallons = hogshead

 (Note the slight variation in the last item). This gives us the following equivalents:

pint=शराव  
gallon = आढक  
hogshead = खारी

 The apothecaries' fluid measure name equations have been similarly worked out:

minim = बिन्दुक  
fluid dram = तरल शाण  
fluid ounce = तरल शुक्ति  
**pint =** (तरल) **शराव  
gallon =** (तरल) **आढक.**

In dry measures the starting point is **शराव** =pint.Sixty-four **शरावऽ** make a**शूर्प.** So do 64 pints make onebushel. Hence bushel is. A barrel is much greaterthan a **द्रोणी.** Hence it has been rendered by **महाद्रोणी.**

In circular measures **अंश**=degree is well known.**कला** has been used for a minute and **विकला** for a second.**कला** and **विकला** are both ancient words.

Avoirdupois weights being the commonest in useare called **सामान्य भार.** The starting point is **यव**= grain. The next weights are dram, ounce and pound. Thedram and ounce are lighter than our शाण and **शुक्ति**respectively. So they are termed **शाणक** and **शुक्तिका.** The pound is heavier than our अञ्जलि. Hence it istermed **प्राञ्जलि.** The hundredweight approximates our**गोणी**, which word we have retained without the addition  
of a prefix or a suffix. 20 **गोणी**s make a **प्रवर्त.** So do 20hundredweights a ton. Hence ton is **प्रवर्त.**

The word ton has been used variously in theEnglish language :

**short ton (ton) प्रवर्त, लघु प्रवर्त  
long ton** (2240 lbs.)**= gross ton, shipper's tonदीर्घ प्रवर्त**  
**metric ton = millier = tonneau प्रयुत-धान्य, मानिक प्रवर्त  
assay ton परीक्षा-प्रवर्त  
commercial ton वाणिज्य-प्रवर्त**  
(Cornish) **mining ton** (2352lbs.) **खनि-प्रवर्त  
nautical ton नावीय प्रवर्त  
register ton** (a unit of internal capacity forships—100 c.ft.) **पञ्जी-प्रवर्त.**

Troy weights are **हैम भार** (हेम gold). A troy grainis the same as an avoirdupois grain. Pennyweight (24grains) is much bigger than our **माष** (15 यवऽ). So it istermed **महामाष.** 480 **यव**s make one **शुक्ति**. So do 480grains make one ounce troy. Thus an ounce is exactlya **शुक्ति.** The pound troy (5760 grains) being smallerthan the pound avoirdupois (7000 grains, प्राञ्जलि) is **प्राञ्जलिका**. A carat (3.086 grains troy) would be **प्रगुञ्ज** (3 यवऽ make one गुञ्ज); and a carat grain (one-fourth of acarat) is **यवक.** *Crith* (Gk. *krithe* "a barley corn") isप्रयव. It is 08987 gram = 1.34805 grains = a liter ofhydrogen at n.t.p.

In apothecaries' weights grain and pound are thesame as in the troy system. Scruple (20 grains) is **प्रमाष** (माष being 15 यत्रऽ). Dram (60 gr.) and ounce (480 gr.)are exactly **शाण** (६० यव) and **शुक्ति** (४८० यवं)**.**

A consolidated series of ancient weights and cubicmeasures from a यव to a **प्रवर्त,** is attached below:

**१५ यव = माष  
४ माघ = शाण  
२ शाण = कोल  
२ कोल = कर्ष  
२ कर्ष= शुक्ति** (अष्टमिका)  
**२ शुक्ति = पल** (प्रकुञ्च, मुष्टि)  
**२ पल = प्रसृति  
२ प्रसृति = अञ्जलि** (कुडव; ३८४० यव)  
**२ अञ्जलि = शराव** (मानिका; ७६८० यव)  
**२ शराव = प्रस्थ** (a seer)  
**४ प्रस्थ = आढक  
४ आढक= द्रोण  
२ द्रोण = शूर्प  
२ शूर्प = द्रोणी, गोणो** (९९२,०४० यव; ewt.=700,000 gr.;long cwt. = 784,000gr,)  
**४ द्रोणी = खारी  
५ खारी = प्रवर्त** (१९,८४०,८०० यव; ton = 14,000,000 gr.;long ton = 15,680,000gr; प्रवर्तः पञ्चखारिभिः सस्यमाने प्रकीर्तितः– भानुजीदीक्षितकृता अमरटीका व्याख्या-सुधा, वैश्यत्रर्गे श्लोकः ८९)

A word about the abbreviations. The first syllable usually serves the purpose, but in certain cases,for example when the word begins with an oft-used prefix like प्र, there are deviations. These should becarefully noted.

**MATHEMATICS**

 "It is India that gave the ingenious method of expressing all numbers by means of ten symbols, each symbol receiving a value of position, as well as an absolute value; a profound and important idea which appears so simple to us now that we ignore its true merit; but its very simplicity, the great ease which it has lent to all computations, puts our arithmetic in the first rank of useful inventions.  
 "Even though there has been a slow growth of ideas in the history of human civilization, the history of reckoning presents a peculiar picture of desolate stagnation. When viewed in this light, the achievement of the unknown Hindu, who sometime in the first centuries of our era discovered the principle of position, assumes the proportion a world event,  
 "The invention of śūnya or zero liberated the human intellect from the prison bars of the Greek counting frame. Once there was a sign for the empty column, "carrying over" on slate, paper or other material for writing was just as easy as carrying over on the abacus.  
 "Āryabhata about A.D. 470_discusses the rules of arithmetic, uses the law of signs of Diophantus, gives a table of sines in intervals of 34, and evaluates *π*as, 3.1416. **In short, Hindu mathematics starts wher Alexandrian mathematics left off.** Just a littlelater, in the sixth century, comes Brahmagupta, who follows the same themes as Āryabhata: calculation, series, equations. These early Hindu mathematicians had already stated the laws of 'ciphers' or śûnya, on which all our arithmetic depends, namely,

a x 0=0  
a + 0=0  
a - 0 = a\*[^3]

[^3]: "To this is to be added=∞"

"Equipped with their simple and eloquent number symbols the Hindus broke away completely from the metaphorical way of dealing with fractions. Theywrote fractions as we write them and they had anarithmetic which lent itself to rapid calculation withoutmechanical aids, they experimented with them as withwhole numbers. Thus Mahāvīra (A, D, 850) gave ourrule for dividing one fraction by another in the samewords which a school teacher might use today 'make thedenominator the numerator and then multiply'.

"All the algorithms for fractions now used wereinvented by the Hindus.

"Is it not equally strange that algebra thatcorner-stone of modern mathematics also originated in India and about the same time that positional numeration did ?

"The advance from 'rhetorical' discussion of rulesfor solving problems to symbolism of the modern sortwas wellnigh impossible for the Greeks, who had alreadyexhausted the letters of the alphabet for proper numbers. Although the Hindu numerals removed thisobstacle to progress, there was at first no social machinery to impose the universal use of devices for representing operators. The only operative symbol which wastransmitted to us by the Arabs from Hindu sources isthe square-root sign (✓)".

**उत्पादकं यत्प्रवदन्ति बुद्वेरधिष्ठितं सत्पुरुषेण सांख्याः ।  
व्यक्तस्य कृत्स्नस्य तदेकबीजमव्यक्तमीशं गणितं च वन्दे ॥**

(Bhāskarācārya, 12th century A.D.)

Algebra is **बीज, बीजक्रिया** or **बोजगणित**, the science of analysis, the operation or computation with 'seeds'. Itwas also known as **कुट्टक-गणित** or simply **कुट्टक** (whichdealt particularly with
indeterminate equations of thefirst degree). Another name was **अव्यक्त गणित**calculations with unknowns' as against **व्यक्त गणित**'calculation with knowns' used for arithmetic and geometry.

According to our ancients, the values of symbolsarithmetic are **व्यक्त** that is definitely determinatewhile in algebra they are **अव्यक्त** that is indefinite. Bhāskarācārya clearly said that the science of**अव्यक्त गणित**is the source of the science of calculation with knowns.

Ancient Hindu algebra comprised the laws ofsigns, the arithmetic of zero and infinity, operationswith unknowns, surds, indeterminate equations of thefirst degree and the square-nature or the so-calledPellian equation. To these may be added concurrenceand dissimilar operations.

Algebra began carly in India during the Vedicage. The geometrical method of the transformationof a square into a rectangle having a given side is equivalent to the solution of a linear equation in oneunknown—

**a**x*= c²*

Vedic fire-altars were constructed in differentgeometrical designs, one of them was the श्येन-चिति (in the form of a falcon). Its body consisted of foursquares, each of its wings a rectangle, and so on. This fire-altar was enlarged in two ways-firstly, so that allthe constituents were affected in the same proportion,.  
secondly, so that the breadth of a portion of the wingswas left unaffected. If *x* be the unit forenlargementin the first case, we shall have to solve the quadraticequation

2*x*×2*x* +2 {*x*(*x*$+ \\frac{x}{5}$}+*x* (*x*+$\\frac{x}{10}$) =$7\\frac{1}{2}$ + *m*,

where *m* denotes the increment of the fire-altar in size

Therefore*x*²=1+$\\frac{2m}{15}$  
In particular, when *m* = 94, we shall have

*x*²=13$\\frac{8}{15}$=(approximately),

which occurs in the *Ṥ*atapatha-Brāhmaṇa,

In the second case of enlargement the equation for *x*will be  
2*x*×2*x*+ 2 {*x*+(*x* +$\\frac{1}{5}$)} (*x*+$\\frac{1}{10}$)=7$\\frac{1}{2}$*m,*

or 7*x*²+$\\frac{1}{2}x$= 7$\\frac{1}{2}$+*m,*  
which is a complete quadratic equation.

The problem of altar construction gave rise alsoto certain indeterminate equations of the second degree, such as,

(1)*x*²+*y*²=z**²**  
(2)*x*²+*a*²=**z**²

and simultaneous indeterminate equations of the type

***ax* + *by* + *cz* + *dw* = *p,*  
*x* + *y* + *z* + *w*= *q.***

  **SYMBOLS OF OPERATION**— The first syllable of a word, placed before or after the quantity, served the purpose of the symbol. For addition one of the Sanskrit words is युत. It is abbreviated to यु. Similarly the ancient Brahmi क, which is a cross, stands as the symbol of subtraction, being the abbreviation of क्षय. गुabbreviated from गुणनor गुणितstands for multiplication and भाfrom भागor भाजितfor division. Often these symbols are not used. Juxtaposition serves the purpose. The use of these symbols is best illustrated by the Bakhshali manuscript. Bakhshali is a village in the Peshawar district. The manuscript lay between stones. It was discovered by a farmer who was digging in the mounds in 1881. This is the oldest mathematical manuscript yet discovered. It is written in ancient Śāradā script of Kashmir on birch-bark. Its age has been variously estimated, some placing it in the second century (in the days of Kanishka), others as late as the twelfth century A.D.

  In later times there was a change of plan in the writing of equations. Here are two illustrations, one from Pṛithūdakasvāmī (860 A.D.) and the other from Bhāskarācārya (1150 A.D.)—

[TABLE]

writing *x* for , for या

*x*².0 + *x*.10 - 8  
*x*²  +*x*.0 +1

or 0*x*² + 10*x – *8 =*x*² +0*x *+ 1

which means10*x – *8 *=x*² + 1.

[TABLE]

writing *x* for या, *y* for का and *z* for नी  
5*x* + 8*y* + 7*z*. + 90 = 7*x* + 9*y*+ 6*z* + 62.

 Equations were classified as यावत् तावत्(simple), वर्ग(quadratic), घन(cubic) and वर्गवर्ग(biquadratic). The स्थानांगसूत्रof Jainas (सूत्र ७४७) is sometimes interpreted to refer to these equations. Another classification of equations is according to Brahmagupta of 628 A.D. एक-वर्ण-समीकरण, अनेकवर्ण-समीकरण and भावित, i.e. equations in one unknown, in several unknowns, and such as involved products of unknowns, एकवर्ण-समीकरण is further sub-divided into linear equations and quadratic equations अव्यक्तवर्ग-समीकरण.

  It would be interesting to follow the ancient algebraists of India one by one and century to century. But it would be outside the scope of this introduction. Here I shall mention in passing a point or two which are of particular interest for the history of mathematics. In 850 A.D. Mahāvīra, a Jain author, wrote an epoch-making work गणित-सारसंग्रह. He knew that the quadratic hastwo roots, and he employed the modern rule for finding the root of a quadratic.

*x* =$\\left\\{ {\\frac{c/2}{1 - a/b} + \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{c/2}{1 - a/b} \\right)^{2} + \\frac{d}{1 - a/b}}} \\right\\}^{2}$

 Our rock-bottom is formed by ancient words—अंश numerator, degree, अंक digit, अन्तर distance, अपेक्षित required, आदेश substitute, आरोही ascending, उपपत्ति proof, करणी surd, क्षितिज horizon, श्रेढी series, वज्रगुणन, वज्राभ्यास cross multiplication, समीकरणequate, निर्वचनinterpretation, निदर्शनillustration, बीजगणितalgebra, मूल root, radical (the European words are translations from Sanskrit), योग sum, राशि quantity, लब्धि quotient, अपवर्त्य multiple, हर denominator, सारणीtable, etc., etc.

 Then there are words of common usage—अग्र leading,अचल constant, अनियत indefinite, अनुसंधान investigation, आधार base, आवर्ती recurring, उच्चतम highest, उन्नयन raising, ऐकात्म्यidentity, चल variable, निश्चायकdeterminant, नियम law, पंक्ति row, प्राकृतिक natural, महत्तम greatest, रेखा line, रेखीय linear, लक्षण characteristic, वास्तविक real, विवेचक discriminant, विस्तार expansion, साधारण common, सामान्य general, सीमाlimit, etc., etc.

 Our ancients used a variety of terms to denote the same idea or the same term to denote various ideas. For us it was neither desirable nor possible to use one word for more than one idea or more than one word for the same idea. We had to use definite terms so that there be no confusion as to what is meant. Thus कर्ण is used for the hypotenuse as well as the diagonal. रुप means form, arithmetical unit, integral numbers, known or absolute number, and a known quantity as having specific form. Similarly वर्णappears for the letters of the alphabet for an unknown magnitude or quantity in algebra, for the figure 1 in aritbmetic and according to some for a coefficient.

 For quotient we have भाग, लब्धि, आप्त, आाप्ति, अवाप्त, अवाप्ति, फल, लब्ध. For coefficient we have गुण, अंक, प्रकृति वर्ण and यावत् तावत्. The coefficient of a root in algebra is मूलगुण. Here गुण is an agent noun, meaning a multiplier, equivalent to गुणक. For multiplication itself, Sanskrit mathematical literature shows a variety which is unsurpassed—गुणन, गुणता, हनन, हति, हत, अभिहति, वध, वर्गणा, पूरण, अभ्यास, क्षोद, प्रत्युत्पन्न, अनुपात stands for proportion, arithmetical progression and rule of three.

 Some of the important specific terms used in mathematics are explained hereunder:

** अंश** 'numerator' and 'degree' is an ancient word. Grade has to be distinguished from degree. It is $\\frac{1}{100}$th part of a right angle and thus smaller than a degree which is$\\frac{1}{90}$thpart of a right angle. It has been translated by अंशक, smaller than an अंश, the suffix -क denoting diminution.

 **अक्ष** has been used in Indian astronomy for 'terrestrial latitude'. We have used the specific word अक्षवृत्त (cf. विषुवद्वृत्त equator, देशान्तरवृत्त longitude). In our terminology अक्षhas been retained for 'axis'.

 **अधिकोण** is an obtuse angle. अधि stands for अधिक i.e. an angle greater than a right angle. Cf. न्यूनकोण acute angle.

 **अनावर्ती** nonrecurring' is from आवर्ती'recurring' आवर्तनis 'recurrence'.

 **अनुच्छेद** 'article' is already in use in Bengali. It has also been used in the Hindi version of the Indian Constitution. Etymologically अनु- small + छेद section.

 **अनुरेखण** 'trace', i.e. 'to copy by following (अनु) the lines (रेखा)', is a denominative verb. अनुरेखितtraced.

 **अन्यथा** 'aliter'. Aliter is a Latin word meaning otherwise. For the Indian student अन्यथाhas its parallel formations in यथा, तथा, etc.

 **अपवर्तक** is used for multiple in Hindi and Bengali. अपवर्तक is an ancient word in the sense of a common measure. अपवर्तनis reduction of a fraction to its lowest term.

 **अयुग्म** 'odd' and 'even' are ancient words used as early as the गृह्यसूत्रऽ.

 **अर्हा**'value' is from $\\sqrt{अर्ह्}$to deserve, to merit, to be worthy of.

 **अल्पिष्ठ** least. Cf. भूयिष्ठ maximum. Both are ancient words.

 **असंमेय** is a faithful translation of incommensurable, element by element: *in-*अ-+ *-com*- -सं- + mensurare $\\sqrt{मा}$+ -able -एय.

 **आदेश** 'substitute' is well-known to students of Sanskrit, e.g. Pāṇini: स्थानिवदादेशोऽनल्विधौ.

 **आयन** 'rectangle' is an ancient word and is also in common use in Hindi, Bengali and other Indian languages.

 **आयाम** length' is an ancient word.

 **अर** is the spoke of a wheel, hence a radius. From अर is derived आर radian, i, e, a central angle subtended in a circle by anarc whose length is equal to the radiusof the circle. Radian, when used as an adjective, would be आरीय.

 **आवर्तकाल, आवर्त** period आ+$\\sqrt{{वृत्}\~}$'to turn round'.

 **उच्छाय and उच्चता**have been specifically used for altitude and height respectively. Both are ancientwords.

 **उदग्र** is an ancient word, 'point upwards', hence 'vertical'.

 **उपसादन** to bring near, उपसन्न brought near, approximate. उभयसाधारणcommon to both.

 **उपसाध्य** corollary, साध्य proposition. A corollary is a proposition requiring no additional proof following upon one just demonstrated.

 **एकक** unit ('a single thing, as a magnitude or number regarded as an undivided whole'). It is used in this sense in Bengali (see Guha's Modern Anglo-Bengali Dictionary).

 **ऐकात्म्य** identity, from एकात्मidentical.

 **कर्ण** 'hypotenuse of a triangle' is an ancient word.

 **कला** 'minute' occurs in सूर्यसिद्धान्त and other works.

 **क्रमचय** and संचयfor 'permutation' and 'combination' respectively are self-explanatory terms and have been used as being clearer and more definite than भावना for combination and व्यतिचारfor permutation.

 **क्षितिज** 'horizon', occurs in आर्यभट and सूर्यसिद्धान्त. It is also widely used in Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, etc. क्षैतिज is horizontal.

 **क्षेत्रफल** area. The word is used in the गोलाध्याय and कात्यायनश्रौतसूत्रas meaning the superficial contents of a figure. It is current in Hindi, Bengali, etc. फल is also used by आर्यभटfor area of a figure. Thus स्फुटफलoccurs for distinct or precise area (of a triangle, etc.).

 **घात** 'power', is widely used in Hindi. It is an ancient word. It is from $\\sqrt{हन्}$to multiply.

 **चरण** quadrant. It is an ancient word and signifies a fourth part.

 **चाप** ‘arc’ is from सूर्यसिद्धान्त.

 **छेदा** logarithm. According to नेमिचन्द्रthe Jain author of त्रिलोकसारif _(x)=2^(u)then _(n) is called the अर्धच्छेद of _(x.)छेद is the number of times a particular number can be divided by a base. If 64=4³then 3 represents the number of times that 64 can be divided by 4. Literally छेद is 'cutting' and the number of times that the division can take place is छेदसंख्या or simply छेदा. In 64 =4³, 3 is the log of 64 to the base 4. दशच्छेदा common logarithm. दशच्छेदापद्धतिcommon system of logarithms, i, e., logarithms having 10 for their base. Its complete translation would be दशाधारछेदा. For brevity दशच्छेदा has been used instead. प्रति-छेदाanti-logarithm.

 **ज्या** is the parent of 'sine'. ज्या'sine of an arc' has been used in the सूर्यसिद्धान्त ११.५७. कोटिज्या 'cosine' is also from the सूर्यसिद्धान्त. There it signifies the cosine of anangle in a right-angled triangle.उत्क्रमकोटिज्या coversedsine. उत्क्रमis versed or reversed.

 **स्पर्शज्या** (abbreviated to स्पज्या) is tangent when it is the portion (of the straight line tangent to a curve) between the point of tangency and a given line. In the sense of a tangent line or curve it is स्पर्शरेखा or simply स्पर्शी.

** त्रि कोण-मिति** is a Sanskrit facsimile of the European word tri-gono-metry. *Tri-*is Sanskrit त्रि. कोणfor Greek *gonia* is the commonest Indian word for angle. त्रिकोण already occurs in the Mahābhārata. कोणस्पृग्वृत्त of भास्कराचार्य has been translated by Colebrooke as a 'circle in contact with the angles; an exterior circle; one circumscribed.' *Metry* is मिति'measurement', from Sanskrit root माto measure.

 **दशमिक** decimal. दशमलव is widely used in Hindi for decimal. Here is visible an attempt to have a phonetic approximation to the English word. But लव meaning a part is not required after दशम, as दशम itself means the tenth part. Decimal is derived from Lat. *decimus* 'tenth' from *decem* 'ten' +-al, of which the exact Indian equivalent will be दशमिक (दशम tenth+ -इक). In Bengali दशमिकis already current (see Guha's Modern Anglo-Bengali Dictionary).

 **दशमिकांश**'mantissa'. The Indian word is crystal clear while the English word is perfectly opaque. In Latin it meant an addition, make-weight. The word is believed to be of Etruscan origin. This word has gone out of use in general English, where it meant an addition of little value. In mathematics it denotes the decimal part of a common logarithm.

 **द्विसम त्रिभुज**quadratic equation. Quadratic is an adjective from quadrate 'square'. In a quadratic equation समीकारthe highest power घातof the unknown quantity is a square द्वि.

 **द्विसम त्रिभुज** isosceles triangle. Latin *isosceles* is from Greek *isoskeles, isos* 'equal' + *skelos* 'leg'.In geometry it is a triangle having two equal sides. It is a significant but unintelligible word. द्विसम त्रिभुज is in comparison simplicity itself. It is a त्रिभुजthree-sided figure, द्विtwo of the sides being समequal.

 **धन** positive and ऋण negative.धन in the sense of an affirmative quantity or plus and ऋण in that of a negative quantity or minus are ancient words.

 **ध्रुव** pole ध्रुवin the सूर्यसिद्वान्त signifies a celestial pole. It is widely used in all important Indian languages.

 **ध्रुववृत्त**meridian. Meridian is a great circle वृत्त on the surface of the earth, passing through the poles ध्रुव and any given place. ध्रुववृत्त is short for ध्रुवान्तर्गामी वृत्त.

 **निर्भेय** problem. A problem is a proposition requiring an operation to be performed or a construction निर्माणto be made. Literally निर्मेयis that which is to be constructed. Cf. प्रमेयtheorem.

** न्यास** for data is widely used in our astronomical literature. Etymologically it is that which has been put down (नि+अस) to serve as a basis for mathematical investigation. Literally data or its singular datum would be दत्त'given'.

 **न्यूनकोण** acute angle. It is less than a right angle. Cf. अधिकोणobtuse angle.

 **परि-**circum-. परिas a prefix implies round, around, about. Circum- is used adverbially to signify around, about, on all sides. Cf. परिकेन्द्रcircumcenter, परित्रिज्या circumradius, परिलेखन circumscribe, परिवृत्त circumcircle.

** परिमाप-** perimeter, the whole outer boundary or measure माप of a body or figure.

 **पादांक** suffix. It is an अंकor figure at the foot. Suffix or sub-index is a character affixed below to a symbol, to distinguish it in its class. Cf. मूर्धाक superscript.

 **पूर्णांक**integer. The Indian term is quite clear in its meaning and is more readily intelligible than its English equivalent. पूर्णांकfor integer, is used in Hindi, Bengali, etc.

** प्रचय** common difference. It is an ancient word.

 **प्रति-** stands for anti-, प्रति-घटीवत्is anti-clockwise from घटीवत् clockwise. वामावर्त and दक्षिणावर्त are ancient words and can be used as alternatives.

 **प्रतिबन्ध** condition. Condition is that which limits or modifies the existence or character of something, a restriction or qualification. The word is used in Hindi.

 **प्रनियम** principle. प्रनियम = प्रथमनियम. Principle is a comprehensive law or doctrine from which others are derived or on which others are founded; an elementary proposition or fundamental assumption. The use of प्र in the sense of first is well-known. Cf. प्रकृतिthe original or primitive substance. प्रथम(प्र+तम) itself is a superlative of प्र.

 **प्रमेय** for theorem is in use in several languages. Guha's Anglo-Bengali Dictionary gives प्रमेयोपपाद्य. प्रमेय is that which is to be established by प्रमाणor proof. Cf. निर्मेय problem.

** फल** 'result' is from सूर्यसिद्धान्त(the result of a calculation, product or quotient, etc.).

 **बहिर्लेखन** escribe. बहिर्लिखित escribed. बहिर्लेखन is to write (or draw) externally. Escribe is to draw (a circle) touching one side of a triangle externally. बहिर्लेखनexcircle, बहिष्कोण exterior angle, बहिष्केन्द्र excentre.

 **बिन्दुरेख** graph. बिन्दुरेख is literally dots and lines. A graph is a diagram symbolising system of inter. relations by spots (बिन्दु), all distinguishable from one another and some connected by lines (रेखा) of the same kind.

 **बिम्ब** 'disc' is an ancient word.

 **भागफल** quotient. Quotient is literally 'how many times'. It is the number resulting फल from the division भाग of one number by another. भागफल is current in Hindi and Bengali. लीलावतीgives फलwhich we have already retained for result in general.Other ancient words for quotient are भाग, लब्धि, आप्त, आप्ति, अवाप्त, अवाप्ति, लब्ध.

 **भिन्न** 'fraction' is from लीलावती. It is widely used in ancient Indian mathematics; some of its compounds are भिन्न-संकलन addition of fractions, भिन्न-गुणन multiplication of fractions, भिन्न-घनthe cube of a fraction, भिन्न-भाग हर division of fractions (लीलावती).

 **भुज** meaning the side of any geometrical figure has been used as early as कात्यायन-श्रौतसूत्र.  
मापांकis clear than English 'modulus' which literally means 'a small measure'.

 **मिथश्छेदन** intersect. Intersect is to cut छेदनinto one another मिथः.

** मूलक्रिया** 'extraction of roots'. It is an ancient word. Latin 'evolution' means simply 'unfolding'.

 **यथार्थ** exact. Cf. सुतथ्य precise, शुद्ध correct, परिशुद्ध accurate.

 **योग** ‘addition’ is from सूर्यसिद्धान्त. Cf. वियोग 'subtraction' from गणिताध्याय.

** राशि**'quantity', an ancient word, is current in Hindi, Bengali, etc.

 **रैखिकी**geometry. रेखागणितis in common use. रैखिकी is short for रैखिकी विद्या the science pertaining to lines or the science of lines. Similarlyप्राणिकी=प्राणिकी विद्या zoology, औद्भिदी= औद्धिदी विद्या botany.

 **Naming of sciences** was as varied in ancient days, as it is today in the European languages. Sometimes abstract nouns were used, as परचित्तज्ञता. Chemistry, surgery are European examples of abstract nouns as names of sciences. In the names of arts and crafts, some word denotative thereof was suffixed—मधूच्छिष्टकृतम् wax-modelling (मधूच्छिष्ट wax),सूचीकर्म needle-work, मणिभूमिका-कर्म gem-mosaic work. Sometimes the word denotative of art and craft was left out as in मणिराग colouring of precious stones.The general action noun करण hasbeen used in शुक्रनीतिसार in धातु-सांकर्य-पार्थक्य-करणम् the art of combination and isolation of minerals.  
 कर्म standing for art was sometimes dropped particularly where the preceding word was itself a compound. It was usual to transfer the neuter gender of कर्म to the compound which was a sort of adjective made to serve as a noun.We have a beautiful examplenin the समवायसूत्र, viz. उदकमृत्तिकम्. The use of adjectives for naming sciences also became common, e.g.सांख्यम्,वैशेषिकम्,ऐन्द्रजालिकम्.  
 As for arts and crafts the general term कर्म was a neuter noun, so for different branches of knowledge there was the general term विज्ञानम्. शुक्रनीतिसार mentions धात्वादीनां संयोगापूर्वविज्ञानम् 'knowledge of new combinations of minerals', and काचपात्रादिकरणविज्ञानम् 'knowledge of making glass utensils'.  
 From the most ancient times we read of numerous विद्याऽ or sciences. The परा and अपरा विद्या of the उपनिषद् are well-known. Again, adjectival forms with feminine endings, originally intended to be followed by विद्या, have been used in the same way as the neuter उदक-मृत्तिकम्. मानसी thus is the science of the mind. त्रयी, वार्ता,आन्वीक्षिकी are well-known from the अर्थशास्त्र of Kautalya.रामचन्द्र in his commentary on the first verse of लक्ष्मणकवि, a continuation of चम्पूरामायण of विदर्भराज, mentions two sciences अदृश्यकरणी and दूरकरणी. The commentators ofश्रीमद्भागवत, such as श्रीधर, record वैनयिकी विद्या, वैजयिकीविद्या, वैतालिकी विद्या  
 The adjectival suffix *-ic* in English (ultimately derived from Skt.
-इक through Greek -*ikos*, Latin *-icus* and French *-ique*) has been similarly used. Greek or Latin nouns that were originally adjectives used substantively have been adopted into English, as arithmetic,music, logic, etc. Since 1600 A.D. the plural form *-ics*has been used instead to denote names of sciences as in physics, mathematics, politics, athletics, economics. This was probably in imitation of the Greek *ta phusika,ta ethika.* It is further interesting to note that these plural forms are now construed as singulars. In French and German the singular is still used in the names of sciences, *e.g., die Physik, die Politik* in German and *la physique*, *la politique* in French.  
 लम्ब 'perpendicular' is an ancient word. Other words used in ancient works are अवलम्ब (लीलावती), अवलम्बक, अधोलम्ब, आलम्व, वलम्ब, कोटि (the perpendicular side of a right-angled triangle, सूर्यसिद्धान्त). Compounds from लम्ब are समलम्ब having equal perpendiculars, अन्तर्लम्ब a triangle in which the perpendicular falls within, etc.  
 लम्बकेन्द्र orthocentre. Orthocentre is the common intersection of the three altitudes of a triangle, or of the four altitudes of a tetrahedron provided these latter meet in a point.  
 लम्ब-कोण right angle, i.e., the angle कोण made by a perpendicular लम्ब. In Hindi and Bengali समकोण is sometimes used for a right angle. It is not a happy word because it means equal.  
 लम्बपूर कोण complementary angle. लम्बपूर is short for लम्बकोण-पूरक that which completes पूरक a right angle लम्ब- कोण.  
  वक्र 'curve' is an ancient word.  
 वर्गsquare,वर्गमूल square root, In ancient usage वर्ग is the square of a number, e.g. पञ्चवर्ग square of five, भिन्नवर्ग square of a fraction. वर्ग and वर्गमूल are widely current in Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, etc.  
 वर्तुल 'circular' is an ancient word. It is from $\\sqrt{}$वृत् to turn, to revolve. Cf. वृत्त a circle.  
 विकर्ण diagonal. In ancient mathematics कर्ण has been used for hypotenuse and diagonal both, कर्ण has been retained by us for hypotenuse, while the specificatory prefix वि- (here short for विशेष) has been added to कर्ण to designate a diagonal.  
 विकोणमान theodolite. Theodolite is an instrument for measuring horizontal and usually also vertical angles. विकोणमान is literally an instrument which measures मान angles कोण of various kinds वि, वि being short for विविध.  
 वियुत minus. It is from सूर्यसिद्धान्त.  
 वियोग 'subtraction' is from गणिताध्याय. Cf. योग addition.  
 विवेचक 'discriminant'. विवेक'discrimination' is well-known.  
 विवेचन is the verbal noun from the same root,  
 विषम 'odd', is from बृहज्जातक of वराहमिहिर AIso current in Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, etc.  
 वृत्त 'circle' is from गणिताध्याय. It is current in many Indian languages.  
 वैकल्पिक 'alternative' is an ancient word. It is used in Hindi, Bengali, etc.  
 व्यञ्चक 'expression' is the current Marathi wordand is also an ancient usage.  
 व्यास'diameter' is from Vedic शुल्बसूत्रऽ.  
 व्युत्क्रम reciprocal. It is an ancient word meaning inverted order, so is the reciprocal of a function. In Latin 'reciprocal' is turning backward and forward.  
 शकल sector (part of a circle). शकल means a fragment, piece, or bit. In Kādambari of Bāna occurs the expression चन्द्र-शकल  
 शतिक centesimal, शतिक 'hundredth' occurs in the बृहत्संहिता of वराहमिहिर.  
 शिरोदण्ड or शिरोवार bar = vinculum. शिरोदण्ड or शिरोवार the bar at the top. Vinculum is a straight horizontal mark placed over two or more members of a compound.  
 शिरोबिन्दु vertex. In any figure having a base it is the point बिन्दुopposite to and farthest from the base, the top शिरस्.  
 शून्य zero. It occurs in such works as गणिताध्यायand वराहमिहिर's बृहत्संहिता. From it are derived Gk *kenos,keneos, kennos,* etc. That the conception of zero is essentially Indian is now well-known. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the Sanskrit term शून्य passed into Arabic as *assifra,* from which are derived Italian, French and English zero.  
 श्रित function. "This term is used mostly to point out dependence on some certain variable or variables"— Mathematics Dictionary by G. James and R.C. James (New York, 1949). श्रित is the past participle form from$\\sqrt{}$श्रि to depend on. आश्रय is from the same root.  
 श्रैढी 'progression' is an ancient word meaning a particular numerical notation or progression of figures.  
 षष्ठक sextant. Sextant is the sixth part of a circle. It occurs as early as पाणिनि.  
 षाष्टिक sexagesimal, meaning pertaining to or founded on, the number sixty. षाष्टिक is the adjectival form of षष्टि sixty.  
 संवादी 'corresponding' is an ancient word (e.g. in काव्यादर्श). Literally it means conversing with, hence agreeing or harmonizing with. The English word 'correspond' (com-+ respond) etymologically means 'to answer to' from which are derived its figurative senses 'to answer in fitness, character, function, amount'.  
 संस्पर्श contact. Contact is from Latin *con-tactus*to touch on all sides.संस्पर्श= सं mutual,close +स्पर्श touch.  
 संचापारकोण radian. Radian is an angle कोण subtended by an are चापequal सं in length to the radius अर-सत्यापन 'verification' is an ancient word. The verbal form is सत्यापयति verifies.  
 सदिश vector. Vector (from Latin *vehere, vectum*to carry) is a complex entity representative of a directed magnitude. सदिश means 'having a direction दिशा'. Our word is clearer and will be more easily understood by the Indian students.  
 समांग homogeneous, uniform. Homogeneous is alike in nature and therefore, comparable in parts (सम alike + अंग parts).  
 समान्तर श्रेढी arithmetic progression. गुणोत्तर श्रेठी geometric progression. Arithmetic progression is a progression श्रेणीwhose elements progress by a constant (समsame) difference अन्तर (positive or negative) as 1,3,5,7 or a, a <MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1693386759rb30.png"/>d, a <MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1693386788rb30.png"/>2d, a<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1693386817rb30.png"/>3d. 'Arithmetic progression' is not a very intelligible expression. Geometric progression is that in which elements progress by a constant factor, as 1,2,4,8,16, any term is obtained by multiplying the preceding one by the constant factor: गुणोत्तर श्रेढी— गुण multiplication, उत्तर successive, श्रेढी progression.  
 समायत square (figure). समायत is an आयत or rectangle with all the sides सम or equal. In Hindi वर्ग is used to denote a square figure as well as the product of a number or quantity multiplied by itself. We have retained वर्ग for the latter sense and समायतfor the former.  
 समाई 'equivalent'. अर्हाis an ancient word. अर्हा 'value' is derived from the root अर्ह्'to be worthy of'.  
 संपतन or संपात coincidence. The English word is derived from Latin *coincidere*, from *co-* + *incidere* to fall on. संपतन = सं- together + पतन falling.  
 संमितीय 'symmetrical' is from संमिति'symmetry' (सम्- sym- +-मिति-metry).  
 सरलन simplify. सरलन is a nominal verb (नामधातु)fromसरल simple.  
 सर्वांगसम congruent. सर्वांगसम (सर्व + अंग + सम) equal in all parts. Congruent is from Latin 'to come together, coincide, agree'. In geometry it means superposable so as to be coincident throughout. For us सर्वांगसमis simpler and more expressive than congruent.  
 साद्यन्त throughout. साद्यन्त (स with + आदि beginning +अन्त end). It is prevalent in this sense in Hindi and Marathi.  
 साध्य 'that which is to be found out by calculation, to be proved or established'. Similarly प्रमेय 'that whichis to be established by प्रमाण or proof.

 सामि- The Latin prefix *semi-*, akin to Greek *hemi-*, is related to Sanskrit सामि-. It is combined chiefly with adjectives and nouns meaning half. Cf, semi-perimeter सामि-परिमाप.

  सारणी for 'table' is of common use among the astronomers of India.  
 स्थिरांक 'constant', is a magnitude that is supposed not to change its value in a certain discussion or stage of investigation. The adding of अंक to स्थिर makes the Indian word clearer,  
 हर 'denominator' is an ancient word. It is derived from $\\sqrt{}$हृ to take away, i.e. to divide.

**TOPOGRAPHICAL MAPS**

 Topographical maps are useful for tourists, touring officers, archaeologists and hunters. In the army the survey maps are of inestimable value. Even the ordinary soldier uses them for finding out distance,direction and altitude.  
 Agricultural and industrial planners also make use of them.  
 Topographical maps mention a large number of items such as cultural features, water features, mining terms (e. g., mineshaft), military terms (e. g., riflerange, air bombing target), communication terms (e. g.,aerodromes, railways, ropeways), forest terms, mountain features, heights, trigonometrical symbols, coastal symbols.  
  A few of these are explained hereunder :  
 Air bombing range वायु-प्रस्फोटन-क्षेत्र. प्रस्फोट is a bomb, 'that which explodes',प्रस्फोटन is the verbal noun for bombing.

 यूप is here used for- the mooring mast. Hence विमान-यूष is "air mooring mast". यूष has been used in ancient literature, not only for the post or pillar to which a sacrificial animal was tied but also for a जयस्तम्भ (see शब्दकल्पद्रुम). यूप is derived from the root यु meaning 'to bind, fasten, hold fast', or from युप्.  
स्थात्र is an ancient Rigvedic word for station. While the English word station has come into wide use in the compound 'railway station', it is not possible to use it in Hindi or any other Indian language in a compound like the seaplane station. -त्र is the suffix of location, i.e., a place where something stands. 'Station' too is etymologically akin to the Sanskrit root स्था.  
 'Feature' is 'form' or 'outer appearance' रूप and hence रूपधेय. Cf. नामधेय.  
 Perennial water is सदाजल (cf. सदानीरा, सदातोया which are names of ancient perennial streams). Non-perennial water is असदाजल.  
 Embankment is बद्धतट.बद्धतट, is more precise and expressive for an embankment, which is a structure of earth, gravel, etc, raised to prevent water from overflowing. बांधin Hindi is a general term and stands for embankment, dam, etc.  
 Canal नहर. It is an Arabic word for stream. In Northern India it is commonly used in the sense of a canal. It has been retained. Sanskrit is कुल्या. It is used in Kashmiri (क्वल), Bengali, Marathi, Nepali (कुलो), Sindhi (कूल), etc.  
 Lock is जलावरोध. Weir is Sanskrit वार. It is a most fascinating word. It is derived from Middle English *wer*, which is from Anglo-Saxon. It is a wordof high antiquity, going back to Sanskrit वृणोति. It means 'to hold back, to keep in check'. In European languages, it has got several cognates, e. g., Greek *erysthai* 'to guard, to rescue', Latin *verire* 'to cover', Lithuanian *verti* 'to close or open', Gothic *warjan*, Modern German *wehren*.  
 Weir is a dam in a river to stop and raise th water for the purpose of conducting it into a new bed,or to a mill or the like.  
 रथ्या for road is a common Sanskrit term use especially for a road suited to wheeled traffic (from रथa chariot').  
 एकपदी for foot-path is from Mahābhārata. The common Hindi word is पगडण्डी (पग a foot).  
 Aqueduct is जल-सेतु (a bridge सेतु for conductingwater). Via-duct is मार्ग-सेतु (a bridge for conducting a way). Via of Latin is akin to Sanskrit वीथि, Greek *oimos,*Lithuanian *vyti.* The full explanatory words would be जलवाहि-सेतु and मार्गवाहि-सेतु. But for the sake of brevity the intermediate वाहिhas been dropped out.

   Dam बांध.बांध is also an embankment, Sanskrit रोधन has been used by us as a specific term for dam as against बद्धतट for embankment रोधस् and रोधना are other alternatives of high antiquity.  
  Siphon नि-नाल is the tube नाल whose one end goes down नि.

'Telegram' was first used on April 6, 1852. "A friend desires us to give notice that he will ask leave...to introduce a new word into the vocabulary. It is *telegram,* instead of telegraphic despatch, or telegraphic communication". *Albany* (N. Y.) *Evening Journal* (*April* 6, 1852).

  तार is a common word in Northern India for telegraph as well as for telegram. Hence it has been  
retained. But for technical and more specific usage it is necessary to translate the word. Telegram means a message by telegraph. Telegraph is originally 'an apparatus for communication at a distance'- दूर-लिख Telegraph is also used for a telegram दूरलेख. Etymologically *tele-* is 'far' दूर + *gram* 'writing' लेख.  
  Tele- occurs in no less than two hundred words, some of which are-teleautogram, teleautograph, teleanemograph, telebarograph, telebarometer, telechirograph, telecinematography, telecode, telecommunication, telecryptograph, telectroscope, telegnosis, telegony, telegraphone, telegraphoscope, telehydrobarometer, telelectric, telelectrograph, telelectroscope, telemanometer, telemechanic, telemechanics, telemeter, telemetry, telemetrograph, telemotor, telenergy, telengiscope, telepath, telephone, telephonograph, telephoto, telephotograph, telephotography, teleradiophone, telescope, telescriptor, teleseismology, telespectroscope, telestereoscope, telesthesia, teletactor, teletape, teletherapy, telethermoaph, telethermometer, teletopometer, teletype, telepesetter, teletypewriter, television, televisor, televocal, teleevox, etc., etc.

 When one looks at a series like this one knows that one has to deal not with a single word but with a pattern of words, whose initial element is *tele* which is दूरWhile for ordinary purposes it would do to have the word ar but for more specific purposes and for achieving uniformity and understanding, one has to translate the word and distinguish between telegram (noun and verb), telegramic or telegramatic (adjectives), telegraph (noun and verb). Not only that. The word telegraph has derivatives too: telegrapher, telegraphic, telegraphically, telegraphist. It enters into compounds like telegraphone, telegraphoscope. Telegraphese, though not in common use, is a well-recognised word in the English language, meaning "a language characterized by terseness and elliptical expressions, such as common in telegrams". Phrases with telegraph are numerous, e. g., telegraph wire, telegraph wireman, telegraph rope, telegraph plant or wireless telegraph,. typewriting telegraph, solar telegraph, needle-telegraph,. field telegraph, auto-telegraph, photo telegraph, radiotelegraph, typo-telegraph and similar words ending in telegraphy.

 Tele-communication includes communication by telephones, telegraphs, etc.

  If we translate telegraph, telegram, telephone, television, etc., with then we shall be having thesame inter-connection as obtains in English. As pointed out before, it would be possible to have all the derivatives, compounds and phrases of telegram and telegraph by such a word.

 Telephone is दूरभाष'speaking from a distance'- In Siam they use the word . It is a beautiful word. Only it does not yield a verbal form so readily. दूरभाष gives the verbal form दूरभाषण to telephone, दूरभाषक one who telephones, telephoned, telephonic,. दूरभाषणा telephony.

 'Railway' is known only to the English-speaking world. Even in English-speaking countries there are other substitutes: 'ironway, ironroad, railroad'.

 In other countries of Europe and the rest of the world 'railway'! is usually translated with the help of local words for 'iron' and 'way or wagon'. In modern Greek it is *sidero-dromos,* in German *Eisen-bahn,* in French *chemin* de fer. Similarly in Arabic, Japanese, etc.

 Railway has not to be taken as a single word, Rail, railway, railway train are three connected words.

 Railway is one of a series of words expressing different types of ways-such as, water-way, rope-way, road-way, air-way, bridge-way, cable-way, wire.way, foot-way, sea-way, run-way, tram-way, etc., etc.

 In most of these words 'way' can be uniformly translated by मार्ग.

 For scientific purposes and to meet the requirements of compounds and derivatives it is necessary to give an Indian word ( iron). Incidentally, it may be pointed out that is the parent of the Latin aes, German Eisen and English iron.

 लोहमार्ग can be used as a synonym of अयोमार्ग, only in Southern India z often means metal. In the list of technical and scientific terms for chemistry issued by the Government of Madras in 1947, अयस् has been adopted as the term for iron or ferrum, अयकfor ferric and for ferrous (p. 25, s.v. *elements*).

 Gauge-In railways gauge is the distance between the heads of the rails, or secondarily, the distance between the wheels of a vehicle. It has been translated by with the specificatory prefix प्र.

 Siding is from side पार्श्व. It is also known as cide-track पार्श्व-पथ.

 Tram was originally a coal-wagon, nowadays, simply a wagon, whether for coal, for ores or for logs, hence a वाहिका. Tram-way would thus be translated fully by वाहिका-पथ which may be shortened to वाहिका.

 Irish Bridge is the same as cause-way. Causeway is originally *causey+way.*It is a raised way or road across wet or marshy ground. Hence it has been translated as उच्चमार्ग. Sometimes, however, cause-way stands for causey, meaning a high-way or a pave-way.

 International अन्तराष्ट्रीयis the correct Sandhi form for अन्तर् + राष्ट्रिय (Panini रो रि ८.३.९४, ढ्रलोपे पूर्वस्य दीर्घोऽणः६.३.१११ 'Final र्, followed by another र् , disappears, lengthening the short vowel that precedes it'). राष्ट्रिय again is a Pāninian form as against राष्ट्रीय in  
Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa. राष्ट्रीय is widely used these days. Those who are not troubled by a grammatical conscience or those who are ignorant of it, can freely use अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय. Some others use आन्तर-राष्ट्रीय, using the adjectival form आन्तर instead of अन्तर and thus avoiding the Sandhi.

 Tribe is an aggregation of people, generally living in the forests— वनजाति.On account of their living together, they might be called fa. In Orissa they are known as जनजाति, जन being used in the sense of प्राकृत जन common, unsophisticated men.

परगना is derived from प्रगणक, employed in ancient inscriptions.

Reserved and protected have been distinguished in the translation by fa and fa respectively.

 Wooded area is लघुवन. Wood is a dense growth of trees usually greater in extent than a grove and smaller than a forest, Wooded area might stand for a wood. It may be taken in its literal sense, 'the area covered with wood or trees'. In that case it would be वनाच्छादित क्षेत्र, वृक्षाच्छादित प्रदेश (प्रदेश region).

 शीनfor snow is a Kashmirian word. It is from Sanskrit $\\sqrt{}$श्यै 'to be frigid, to congeal'. शीत, श्यान अवश्याय(Hindi ओस dew), प्रतिश्याय (Marathi पडसें) are also from the same root.

 Moraine is much better expressed by the Indian word हिमोढ (हिम ice + ऊढ carried, from$\\sqrt{}$ वह् to carry, वहन carrying, at carriage) than by French *moraine,* which  
is of doubtful origin.

 Crevasse is a fissure in the mass of a glacier or snowfield; hence हिमविदर (विदर fissure, वि asunder+ √ हृto tear).

Contours or contour lines are imaginary lines connecting the points on a land surface that have the same elevation, समोच्चरेखा. Contour value is a समोच्चांक a figure (अंक) marking the elevation of the समोच्चरेखा.

Rock outcrops are asina às i.e. rocks that have come out to the surface of the ground (cf. mineral outcrop तलागत खनिज).

Terrace is उत्तल (उत् raised + तल surface).

 Mangrove is a tropical maritime tree or shrub with numerous aerial prop roots which ultimately form an impenetrable mass, so that mangrove swamps become active land builders. वायुशिफ is the name given to the mangrove, from its aerial roots (शिफ root).

 Colourmay be regarded as a psychological category; it can be described and specified in terms derivable from introspective analysis, without any reference whatever to wave lengths, to energy, or to any physical category; but it is also possible to state the physical correlates of the psychologically determined attributes of colour and to draw up certain psychophysical relations between them. All colours are divisible into two classes, the chromatic colours, as reds, greens, purples, browns and pinks; and the achromatic, or neutral colours, including black, white and the intermediate series of greys. The latter are foundto differ from each other only in their degree of

<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1693049232Screenshot2023-08-26165654.png"/>

resemblance to or difference from black (or white). is possible to form a series, ranging from black white, with a median grey at the centre differing equally from black and white, and with each other grey differing from its immediate neighbours by equal sense differences. This series can be made into a scale by assigning an ordinal number to each grey, either ascending toward the lighter greys from black as zeroor ascending with positive numbers and descending with negative numbers from median grey as zero. That attribute which thus measures the variation of the greys is called brilliance; dark greys have low, median grey has medium, and light greys have high brilliance.

 Chromatic colours differ from cach other not only in brilliance but also in hue and saturation. Hue is that attribute in respect to which colours. may be described as red, yellow, green or blue, or as intermediate between two of these. Hues form a natural cyclic series (hue cycle, colour cycle or colour gamut). Colours of the same hue and equal brilliance may differ from each other in saturation, that is, in vividness of hue or in degree of difference from grey. In terms of these three attributes, colours can be arranged in a symbolic tridimensional space (colour solid) having the grey series as axis, with median grey at the centre and black and white at the extremities. Corresponding to each grey is a plane perpendicular to the axis, in which lie the points representing all colours of equal brilliance. In each plane, hue is represented cyclically in the order of the hue cycle, and saturation is represented radically, with the axial points (greys) as reference points of zero saturation, Thus any colour can be specified by giving three ordinal numbers (colour constants or dimensions) which are the co-ordinates of the corresponding point in the colour solid. By the establishing of arbitrary division points on the scales of brilliance and saturation any colour can be described as having very low, low, medium, high or very high position on these scales. "Of very low brilliance" means closely resembling black; "of low brilliance", about half way between black and middle grey; "of medium brilliance", about as brilliant as middle 'grey; "of high brilliance", about half way between middle grey and white; "of very high brilliance", closely resembling white. Similarly, "of very low saturation" means almost grey; "of very high saturation" means very vivid.

 All hues may be described in terms of the four psychologically primary hues, red, yellow, green and blue, which are themselves describable in terms of other hues. Thus red-yellow denotes hueequally resembling, and differing equally from, red and yellow. Between each consecutive pair of the psychologically primary hues many intermediates can be recognized. By the establishing of arbitrary points of division on the hue cycle, hues can be classified as yellowish-red, reddish red-yellow, red-yellow, yellowish red-yellow, reddish-yellow, yellow, greenishyellow, yellowish yellow-green, etc.

  In the method of homo-hetero-analysis, or so-called mono-chromatic analysis hue is determined (to a first approximation but not exactly) by dominant wave length, saturation by purity and brilliance by total light. The wave length of the spectral light required for match is called the dominant wave length. The ratio of the intensity of the spectral light to that of the total (spectral plus grey) light is the purity. The third measure is the total light, integral with respect to wave length.

 In the English tongue colours have been named not in a scientific but in an arbitrary manner.For example, opera pink, tea rose, germanium, cardinal, fluorite violet are reds with different grades of brilliance: very high, high, medium, low and very low respectively. Take another series of reds: peach, salmon, tile red, henna and plum similarly graded. These are known as common names of colours. They may be useful as containing standards for comparison, but every peach, plum and rose does not have the same hue, saturation and brilliance. For popular usage a number of these names have been retained in our translation, but it has been considered imperative to devise a system of scientific nomenclature, in which four hues, five intermediate grades between any two of them, five grades of saturation and five grades of brilliance have been made the basis of colour names. Every colour name specifies hue, saturation and brilliance, thus containing the complete definition within itself, Altogether, sixteen words have been employéd, twelve prefixes and four nouns. They are familiar to every schoolboy. Only, he has to learn them in a new context.

**HUES**

  To take the hues first. There are four primary hues: red, yellow, green and blue. Their common names are रक्त, पीत, हरि and नील. The intermediatecolours between red and yellow, yellow and green, green and blue, blue and red are given hereunder:

<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1693051659Screenshot2023-08-26173607.png"/>

Besides the four wor ds standing for the four primary hues, two pre fixes **आ** 'slight' and **अति** 'much' are all thatare required to be learnt.

**SATURATION**

**(VIVIDNESS OF HUE)**

**विशदता**  
**(वर्ण-सम्पत्)**

 Saturation is that attribute of chromatic colours which determines their degree of difference from a greyof the same brilliance; distinctness or vividness of hue. It is also called chroma, purity.

<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1693201490Screenshot2023-08-28111425.png"/>  
**BRILLIANCE  
शुभ्रता**

 Brilliance is that attribute of a colour without which it cannot exist (except that black is considered to have zero brilliance), and in respect of which it may be classed as equivalent to some member of the series ofgreys ranging from black ( as the zero member) to white; roughly, the degree of resemblance to white or difference from black.

**EXAMPLES**

Note

*1. The order in our translations is brilliance, saturation, hue. Saturation is connected with hue. Every hue has a saturation. So in colour names saturation prefix always comes nearer to hue.  
2. If either brilliance or saturation be medium, the word is left out; but when both brilliance and saturation be medium, one E serves for both.  
3. Prefixes for brilliance begin with consonants, those for saturation (excepting ) begin with cowels.  
4. Prefires for brilliance end in vowels, which naturally coalesce with the following vowel initials of saturation prefixes. That effects an economy of one syllable.*

cameo green (yellow-green, saturation low, brilliance high) प्रात्र-पीत-हरि.  
Dresden blue (blue, sat. medium, bril. medium) मध्य-नील.  
moss grey (yellow, sat low, bril medium) अव-पीत.  
murrey (red, sat high, bril. low) न्युद्-रक्त.  
pyrethrum yellow (yellow, sat, medium, bril, high) प्र-पीत.

[TABLE]

Yellow ocher and chamois are both रक्तातिपीत, but buff is redder पीतरक्तक. In saturation buff is medium, yellow ocher is a bit higher उदा, and chamois a little lower अवा. In brilliance, buff and chamois are high, but yellow ocher is slightly lower आप्र. Thus yellow ocher is आप्रोदारक्तातिपोत, buff is प्रपीतरक्तक and chamois प्रावारक्तातिपीत.

  Hereafter follow tables of the four primary and twenty intermediary hues registering Indian names of

all their shades, i. e. five grades of saturation and five grades of brilliance.

 Each square shows Indian names. English names are not available for every one of them. That demon-strates the superiority of a system of scientific nomen-clature to an arbitrary one.

 For many of the colours, English has a confusing multiplicity of names. Only one is put within a square. Others are given below the tables.

**CHEMISTRY**

* Nagarjuna is our first known alchemist whose work has survived to the present day. He belongs to the same age which produced the famous nonrusting iron pillar of Delhi bearing the inscription of an unidentified king Candra (the carbon content of iron is 0.5 per cent). In his work Nagarjuna covers the whole gamut of ancient alchemic processes. He describes different types of crucibles and stills, cupellation, sublimation, colouring and alloying of metals, extraction of copper from pyrites, use of metal oxides as medicines, etc., etc.*

* The earliest datable account of Nagarjuna is given by Kumārajiva in 405 A.D. Strange as it may seem, it is preserved in China and not in India. According to him, Nāgārjuna was born under the Arjuna tree, whence the second part of his name. His instructions he obtained from the Nagas. Hence the name Nagarjuna. Literally naga means a serpent. In the accompanying portraitone can see the heads of no less than five serpents emerging from behind the halo which forms the background of the head.*

* In Chinese he is known as Lung-Shu or Lung-Meng. The Chinese traveller I-Tsing places Nagarjuna in the first century A.D. as the contemporary of king Kanishka, both of whom are said to have appeared four hundred years after the Nirvana of Buddha. Other Chinese sources of information are Gunabhadra, Bodhiruci and Śikṣānanda.*

* Long accounts of Nagarjuna are available in Tibetan literature. There he is shrouded in legend and mystery. As a sorcerer he is glorified in Grub-thob brgyad-cu-rtsa-bshihi rnam-thar and dpag-bsam-Gon-bzan of Sum-pa mkhan-po ye-ces dpal-hbyor. According to these he was born in the land of Vidarbha (modern Berar) as the son of a wealthy Brahmin who had remained childless for many years. At an early age, at the suggestion of the High Priest Shri Saraha Bhadra of the University of Nalendra in Magadha, he entered the Buddhist order and specialised in all the sciences of his day. After the death of Saraha Bhadra he became the President of the University. Under him the University flourished to such an extent that it obscured the splendour of Vajrāsana, namely Buddha Gaya. Several kings came under his influence.*

* The Tibetan tradition has preserved the name of his teacher, Rahula, while Hiuen-Tsiang mentions one of his pupils, Aryadeva. Nagarjuna's great fame in Buddhist literature rests on his being one of the founders of Mahayana system of thought, which spread soon after him into Tibet, China, Mongolia, Korea and Japan.*

* Nagarjuna is the discoverer of several eye medicines and of the elixir of life which strengthens the weakening forces of men in old age and prolongs life and happiness. He rescued starving humanity from famines by exchanging gold for grain in far off lands. The Tibetan historian Taranatha records that Nagarjuna had strong dykes built to save Buddha Gaya from inundations.*

* Nagarjuna is also the discoverer of several gold mines in South India.*

* The portrait on the opposite page is from a Tibetan original in Tashi Lumpo Monastery. The work of reproduction in colour was undertaken by the Tibetan artist Dge-hlun-chos-phel and Phanindra Mookerjeu for the late Shri R. S. Pandit. The copper plates were very kindly lent to me by Shrimati Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit. portrait represents peace and plenty, power and serenity as the rewards of knowledge of the world in its material and spiritual aspects. Here is the maxim of Nagarjuna:*

* "As long as the science of chemistry prevails, let hunger, pain and poverty not torment men."*

  Elements are the ultimate constituents of matter. In ancient times matter was considered to be constituted of five elements—earth, air, fire, water and sky. This division of the material world was intended to correspond with the sense—organs of smell, touch, sight, taste and hearing respectively. Now when we start teaching chemistry, the पञ्चतत्त्व or पञ्चभूतhave to give place to ninty-two तत्त्वऽ. Of these, several were known to the ancients, namely, antimony, iron, copper, tin, arsenic, mercury, silver, sulphur, lead and gold. There are 17 other names which are very well represented like carbon by प्रांगार, sodium by क्षारातु, calcium by चूर्णातु, etc., etc. स्फटीalum yields स्फट्यातुaluminium. For oxygen we have जारक. We have perfect Sanskrit counterparts of words like hydrogen and phosphorus in उदजनand भास्वर respectively. Instead of calling the substance by its Greek name bromine which means 'bad smelling', we call it by its Indian name दुराघ्री. The rest which are new names are based on some distinctive characteristic of the element. The Indian names have the advantage of being words of the soil and are capable of being understood.

 The name of every element begins with a distinct syllable. Thereby we have succeeded in having a single graphic unit as a symbol of each element. In the European system it is not possible. They have had recourse to two graphic units as symbols in the majority of cases.

 Element-names are of very great importance for the development of our languages as vehicles of scientific thought. Chemical elements are of universal application. In pharmacy their domination is absolute. Medicines deserve to be better known and better understood. That can only be achieved by Indian words and not by foreign words.

 Names of minerals are more than a thousand. In the English language these names are just mouth-filling syllables mostly devoid of significance. With Indian names of elements, we have been able to name the minerals according to their chemical constituents. Thus, every name carries within it the indication of the chief elements of which it is composed.

 In the notes that follow the name of each element, we have compiled sufficient linguistic material from the different Indian and allied languages to show as to how the new words are deeply rooted in the Indian soil.

 The following names are in use in India since ancient times :

**अंजन stibium.**

 It is an all-India word: Hindi, Panjabi, Nepali, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, Oriya, Kannada अञ्जन; Malayalam, Tamil अञ्जनम्; Telugu अंजनमु.

**अयस् ferrum.**

** **अयस् is the forefather of Latin*aes,*German *Eisen*English *iron* and scores of other words in ancient and modern European languages. English *ore* is also akin to अयस्. It is used in high literature in North India, particularly in Hindi and Bengali. In South India its use is commoner: Malayalam, Telugu ; Kannada अयस्; Tamil अयशु.

**ताम्र cuprum.**

** **It is an all-India word: Kashmiri, Shina त्राम्; Kumaoni तामो; Nepali ताम्र, तामो; Assamese ताम्; Bengali ताम्र, तामा; Oriya ताम्र, तम्बा; Hindi ताम्र, तांबा; Panjabi ताम्बा; Sindhi ट्रामो; Gujarati त्रांबुं, तांबुं, ताम्र; Marathi तांबें, ताम्र; Malayalam ताम्रकं,ताम्रं; Kannada ताम्र, ताम्ब्र; Telugu ताम्रमु; Tamil तामिरम्, ताम्बिरम्; Singhalese तम्ब.

**त्रपु stannum.**

** **Like अयस्, ताम्र, रजत and सीस, त्रपु is as old as the Veda. It is derived from $\\sqrt{{त्रप्}\~}$to be shy, on account of its low melting point. It is still used in South India; Malayalam and Kannada त्रपु; Telugu त्रपुवु.

**नेपाली arsenic.**

** **नेपाली or Susruta's नेपालज is a most important word for a historical economic geography of the world in general and India in particular. नेपाली or नेपालज 'produced in Nepal' is originally red arsenic, which is one of the chief sources of the element arsenic. We have specialized the word for arsenic, the element. For arsenic trioxide, which is a deadly poison, the modern languages of India use more than one word, and in common, non-scientific usage these can be retained.

**पारद hydrargyrum.**

** **पारद is an all-India word: Panjabi पारा ; Bengali, Oriya, Hindi, Marathi पारद, पारा; Sindhi, Nepali पारो; Gujarati पारद, पारो; Malayalam पारतम्; Kannada पारद; Telugu पारदमु; Tamil पारदम्.

**रजत argentum.**  
 From रजत are derived Greek *argyros* Latin *argentum*, Old Irish argat, etc.रजत is still widely used  
in India, although there are other words as well. Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Oriya, Kannada रजत; Malayalam रजतं; Telugu रजतमु; Tamil इरशिदम्.  
**शुल्बारि sulphur.**  
 शुल्बारिis the parent of Latin *sulphur, sulpur, sulfur.* This word has been borrowed from Latin by European languages. It is only in Sanskrit that it has a significance 'enemy of copper'.  
 Another common word for sulphur in India is गन्ध, गन्धक. In our terminology we have used गन्धfor thio for its derivatives and compounds.  
**सीस plumbum.**  
** सीस**is an all-India word: Nepali सिसो; Kumaoni सीसो; Bengali सीस, सिसा; Oriya सीसा, सीसक; Hindi सीस, सीसा; Panjabi सीसा; Sindhi सीहो; Gujarati सीसु; Marathi शिसें; Malayalam सीस, सीसक-; Kannada सीस; Telugu सीसमु; Tamil शीशम्.  
**स्वर्ण aurum.**  
 स्वर्णis an all-India word: Kashmiri स्वन्; Western Pahari (Bhadrawahi) सुन्नो; Kumaoni सुनो; Bengali, Hindi स्वर्ण, सोना; Oriya सुवर्ण्ण, सुना; Panjabi, Lahndi सोना; Sindhi सोनु; Gujarati सुवर्ण, सोनँ; Marathi सुवर्ण, सोनें; Malayalam स्वर्ण्ण; Kannada स्वर्ण; Telugu स्वर्णमु; Tamil शुवर्णम्, शोन्नम्; Singhalese सुवन्.

**II**

 Fourteen ancient names of substances have been made the basis of forming such element as are closely connected therewith: अंगार (charcoal) yields प्रांगार \[ प्र उत्कर्षे \] carbon \[ from Latin *carbo* coal, charcoal \].  
 Cf. German Kohlen-stoff, Russian uale-rod, Finnish hiili, Bengali विशुद्ध अंगार, Kannada an Malayalam अंगार, इंगाल. SimilarlyJapanese<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1693461089Untitled.png"/> tan-so charcoal-pure. It would not be out of place here to point out that Lithuanian *angli*-s, Russian *ugolj*, German *Kohle*, English coal, etc., are genetically related to Sanskrit अंगार.  
 अंगार is an all-India word: Kafiri (Ashkun) अङ्गा Dardic (Khovar) अङ्गार् , (Torwali) अङ्गा; Shinaअङ्गार्;

 कुप्य (base metal, zinc) yields कुप्यातु \[ कृप्य + धातु \] \[ from German Zink, of unknown origin\].  

Cf.<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1693464082J.png"/>Japanese *a-en*, next-to-lead, कुप्य is zinc used in High Bengali, Kannada and Malayalam. क्षार (soda) yields क्षारातु \[क्षार+धातु\] sodium \[New Latin, from *soda*\].  
 The wordक्षार is universally used in India, both in its pure form as well as in a slightly modified form: Sindhi खारु; Kashmiri, Panjabi, Lahndi, Assamese, etc. खार; Hindi, Nepali, Gujarati, Marathi, Oriya क्षार, खार; Bengali क्षार; Kannada क्षार, कार; Tamil कारम्; Telugu क्षारमु, कारमु; Malayalam कारं, क्षारं; European Gypsy छार् 'ashes'.  
 **गोमेद** (zircon) yields गोमेदातु \[ गोमेद + धातु \] zirconium \[from *zircon*\].  
 गोमेद is an all-India word: Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati गोमेद; Malayalam, Tamil गोमेदकम्; Kannada गोमेदक; Telugu गोमेधिकमु.  
 Hafnium resembles the previous element zirconium, closely and is hence named गावातु गाव from गो(मेद)related to go(meda) +धातु \].  
 **चूर्ण** (calcis, lime) yields चूर्णातु \[ चूर्ण+धातु \] calcium \[Latin *calx*, *calcis* lime\].  
 Almost all languages of India and Ceylon, from Dardic in the extreme North-West up to Singhalese in Ceylon, derive their words for lime from Sanskrit चूर्ण, e.g., Hindi, Panjabi, Lahndi; Nepali चुन्; Bengali चूर्ण, चुन; Marathi चूर्ण, चुना; Sindhi चुनु; Gujarati चुनो; Assamese सुन्; Oriya चूर्ण्ण, चून; Telugu सुन्नमु;Kannada चूर्ण, सुण्ण; Tamil शुण्णाम्बु, शुण्णम्; Malayalam चूर्ण्ण; Singhalese हुणु.  
 **टंकण** (borax) yields टांकणboron \[ from borax \].  
 Cf. <MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1693465735jj.png"/>Japanese ho-so, borax-pure.  
 टंकण is widely used. It is also called टंक or टंकणक्षार. Hindi, Kannada टंकण; Bengali टंकण, टंक; Gujarati टंकण-खार; Marathi टंकण, टांकणखार; Sindhi कंगड-कारु (cf. Sanskrit टंगर); Malayalam टंकणं; Telugu टंकणमु. Borax was exported

from India to far-off lands in the East as well as in the West. In the Malay Peninsula it is still called *tingkal*. Persian and Arabic show *tankar, tinkar, al-tinkar*. The word reached England as early as 1635 A.D., when it is found spelt tyncall; other spellings of the word are *tinkal, tincal, tinkar, tincar.*  
रुप (silver) yields रुपक \[nickel being nearly silver-white \] nickel \[abbreviated from German *Kupfer-nickel* copper-demon\].  
  रुप orरुप्य is an all-India word: European Gypsy, Shina, Assamese रुप्; Dardic (Kalasha) रुव, (Gawarbati) रुप्; Kashmiri र्वफ्; Western Pahari (Poguli) रुप्प्; Bengali रूप्य, रुपा, रूपा, रौप्य; Oriya रुपा; Hindi रूप; Panjabi रुप्पा; Sindhi रुपोः Gujarati रूपु; Marathi रुपें, रूप्य; Kannada रूप्य; Malayalam रूप्यं; Telugu रुप्यमु; Tamil उरूप्पियम्. It is well-known through 'rupee' the silver coin of India.  
 **लवण**(salt) yields लावणी\[ लावणrelated to salt + -ई -ine; a rare element related to the halogens, halo- 'salt' लवण-\] alabamine \[ from Alabama, a State in U.S. A. + -ine\].

 वंग is used in Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Oriya, Kannada, Telugu (वंगमु), Tamil and Malayalam (वंगम्).  
The English word *bangle* is Hindi *bangri* which is from वंग.  
 **वैडूर्य** (beryl) yields विडूरberyllium \[from beryl \].  
 **वैडूर्य** is also called वैदूर्य, विडूरज, विदूरज—विडूरे भव =वैडूर्य , विडूरे जायते = विडूरजं. वैडूर्य 'beryl' is a silicate of beryllium and aluminium Be₃Al₃(Si O₃)₆वि_(३)स्फ_(३)(सै ज_(३))_(६.)  
 वैडूर्य, Prakrit बेलूरिय has been borrowed from India by the major cultural languages of the world: Chinese *pi-liu-li* (abbreviated *pi-liu* or *liu-li*), Arabic and Persian *bullur*, Greek *berullos*, Latin *beryllus*, Old French *beryl,* *beril,* English *beryl.* Cf. D. Junius Juvenalis, a Latin poet of the 1st cent. A.D.: "A precious stone, of a sea-green colour, found in India." In China, Persia, Arabia the word was applied also to crystal, whence Mediaeval Latin *berillus* 'an eyeglass or spectacles', whence German Brille and Dutch bril 'spectacles'. English *brilliant* and *brilliance* are from the same source.  
 ** वैडूर्य**being the name of a precious stone is used in high literature more than in the common language: Hindi, Bengali, Oriya वैदूर्य; Malayalam वैडूर्य्य; Kannada, Marathi वैडूर्य; Telugu वैडूर्यमु; Tamil वैडूरियम्.  
 **सिकता** (sand) yields सैकता \[ सैकत related to sand + -आ -on; sand is impure silica \] silicon \[from Latin *silicis* a flint \].  
 Silicon is also known as silicium (German *Silizium*), though it is a non-metallic element. Germans have their own name also *Kiesel-stoff* (*Kiesel-erde* silica), while the Russians call it *kr emnij.*  
सिकताis used in Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Oriya, Kannada (सिकत, सिकते), Malayalam and Telugu (सिकत).  
 **सिकता** (sand) also yields सिकातु \[ सिकता + धातु; it resembles silicon in some respects, and was formerly termed *eka-silicon*\] germanium \[from Latin *Germania* Germany\].  
 सिक्ष्य (glass or crystal) yields सिक्ष्यातु \[सिक्ष्य + धातु it is crystalline in structure. Its salts are used in making highly refractive glass\] thallium \[from Greek thallos a young shoot\].  
 स्फटी (alum) yields स्फट्यातु \[स्फटी + धातु\] aluminium \[from Latin *alumen* alum\].  
 स्फटी, स्फटिका, स्फटिकारि are all used as synonyms and denote 'alum'. They are used all over India: Nepali फड्किरि; Bengali स्फटिक, फटिक; Hindi स्फटी, फट्करी, फिट्किरी Panjabi फट्करी; Gujarati फट्कडी; Marathi स्फटी, फटकी; Oriyaस्फटिकारि, Malayalam स्फटिकं; Kannada स्फटिके; Telugu स्फटिक.

**III**

**जारण** signifying 'oxidizing of metals' has been used in the Indian alchemic literature. Hence has been derived our word for oxygen जारक. The common Hindi word for rust जर and जरना to rust', are from the Sanskrit $\\sqrt{}$जृृ, जरण, जारण.  
 Oxygen is adapted from French *oxygene*, intended to mean 'acidifying (principle),' *principe* *acidifiant*(Lavoisier). It is derived from Greek *oxus* sharp + *-gen*producing. Lavoisier's original term, proposed in 1777, was *principe oxygine*, changed 1785-6 to *principe oxygène*; thence in 1786 *oxygène* as substantive, spelt in *Nomenclature* of 1787 *oxigéne;* admitted in Dict. *Acad.* 1835 as *oxygène*. Lavoisier held it to be the essential principle in the formation of acids. This idea has been followed up in Japanese <MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1693481350jjj.png"/>*san-so*acid-pure, German *Sauerstoff* and Russian *kislo-rod*. Soon after it was felt that oxygen was not an appropriate term: "Opponents particularly object, that the base of vital air does not deserve the title of oxygen, as many combinations of it are far from being acids." Med. Jrnl. I. 373 (year 1799).

**IV**

 Hydro-gen appears in our terminology in its Indian form उद-जन.  
 Greek *hudro*, Latin *un*da, English *wet, water,* German *Wasser*, Russian *voda*, and similar words in European languages are from Sanskrit $\\sqrt{}$उद्,$\\sqrt{}$उन्द्, उद. Greek *-genes* born, is Sanskrit $\\sqrt{}$जन्. Hydrogen is so called because water is generated by its combustion. Cf. German *Wasser-stoff,* Russian *vodo-rod,* Japanese<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1693482077jjjj.png"/> *sui-so* water-pure.  
उद or उदक is an all-India word: Dardic (Tirahi) उवा (Kalasha) उक्, (Garvi, Torwali) ऊ; Hindi, Marathi उदक; Bengali, Gujarati उद, उदक; Tamil उदम्; Malayalam उदकम्; Telugu उदकमु; Kannada, Singhalese उद.  
 Phosphorus is again a Greek word which has its exact literary equivalent in Indian भास्वर. Greek *phos* is Sanskrit a 'light' and *-phorus* is Sanskrit (to which is also akin English *bear*). Thus भास्-भर would be the exact counterpart, but भास्वर is better sounding, yields the same sense and has been in use since times immemorial. The Telugu people have already used it (भास्वरमु) for phosphorus (vide P. Shankaranarayana, An English-Telugu Dictionary, Madras, 1928).  
 भास्वर 'shining, bright' is an all-India word: Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, Oriya भास्वर; Malayalam भासुरं; Telugu भास्वरमु.

**V**

 Five other words of Greek extraction, argon, bromine, chromium, iodine and krypton, have been allowed to retain their original connotation in Indian words:  
 Argon \[Greek *argon*, neuter of argos inactive, from anot + ergon work \]—मन्दाति \[मन्दslow, indifferent + वातिgas\].  
 So named on account of its inertness. No compounds of it are known.  
 मन्द is an all-India word: Kashmiri मोन्दु Hindi मन्द, मांद; Sindhi मन्दो; Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Oriya, Kannada मन्द; Tamil, Malayalam मन्दम्; Telugu मंदमु; Singhalese मन्द 'small'.  
Bromine \[from Greek *bromos* bad smell + -*ine*\]-  
दुराघ्री \[ दुर् bad + आ$\\sqrt{}$घ्राto smell at + -ई-ine \].  
 Bromine emits an irritating vapour of disagreeable odour. Cf. Japanese<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-16934843651j.png"/>shu-so stench-pure.  
Chromium from Greek chroma colour\]—वर्णातु \[ वर्ण colour + धातु \].  
 So called from the varied colours of its compounds.  
 वर्ण is an all-India word: Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada वर्ण; Oriya वर्ण्ण; Tamil a; Telugu  
वर्गमु; Malayalam वर्ण्णं.  
Iodine \[from Greek *iodes* violet-like + -ine\] जम्बुकी \[ जम्बुकhaving the colour of the rose-apple fruit + -ई -ine\].  
 So called from the colour of its vapour.  
 जम्बु is an all-India word: Hindi, जम्बु, जामुन;Nepali जामु; Assamese ज़ामु; Bengali जम्बु, जाम; Oriya जम्बु, जामु; Panjabi जम्मू; Sindhi जामूँ; Gujarati जंबु, जांबु; Marathi जंबु, जांब; Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam; जम्बु Telugu जम्बुवु Singhalese दम्ब.

**Krypton** \[Greek *krupton*, neuter of *kruptos* hidden \]— लीनाति \[लीन hidden + वाति gas\].  
 It is one of the inert gases occurring in air (one volume in about a million) and in gases from hot  
springs.  
 लीन is an all-India word: Hindi, Bengali, Nepali, Gujarati, Marathi, Oriya, Kannada लीन; Telugu लीनमु; Malayalam लीनं. Tamil has the cognate इलयम्.

**VI**

 Fluorine, indium, radium and radon are of Latin origin. Their translations are very close: Fluorine \[from Latin *fluere* to flow, whence fluorite, which is one of the sources of fluorine\]—तरस्विनी \[तरस्विन् quick, violent, energetic + -ई -ine\].  
 Fluorine is the most active element known. It is active even at very low temperature. It cannot be prepared or kept in vessels of glass which it attacks freely. तरस्विन् is found in several languages of India : Hindi तरस्वी; Bengali तरस्विन्; Telugu तरस्वि 'an express, a courier'; Malayalam तरस्वि ' an express, a runner', तरस्सु ‘velocity, speed'; Kannada तरस्वि 'swift'.  
Indium \[from Latin *ind*icum ‘indigo' + -ium\] -नैलातु \[नैल (from पीली indigo) +धांतु \].  
 It has two characteristic indigo-blue lines in its spectrum.  
 नीली or नील ‘indigo ' is an all-India word: Panjabi, Hindi, Bengali नील; Sindhi नीरु; Nepali, Assamese निल्; Oriya नील, नीली; Gujarati नील 'dark blue'; Marathi नील; Tamil नील्, नीलम्; Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam नीलि.  
**Radium** \[from Latin *radius* ray\]—तेजातु \[तेजस् light, energy + धातु\].  
 तेजस् is an all-India word: Hindi, Bengali, Nepali, Gujarati, Marathi, Oriya तेज; Tamil तेशु; Kannada तेजस्; Telugu, Malayalam तेजस्सु.  
**Radon** \[radium + -on, as in argon\]— तैजसाति \[तैजस ( from तेजस् in तेजातु radium) + वाति gas\].  
It is a gaseous element resembling argon but radio-active.

**VII**

Some names have been derived from the names of other elements, by adding prefixes to them.  
Proto-actinium \[from Greek *proto-*first + *actinium*\]—  
प्रैजातु \[ प्र (as in प्रपितामह) + एजातु actinium\].  
 It is a radio-element which by disintegration yields actinium.  
 Prefix प्र is used extensively in the Aryan and Dravidian languages of India and Ceylon.  
 The sixteen rare earth metals have been given a special suffix. -ला, a bridged from विरला (मृद्) 'rare (earth)'. The full form विरलाhas however been retained in two words:

**Some Interesting Words of Indian Origin**

**There are scores of words used commonly in chemistry of which origins**

**can be traced back to Indian sources. Some of these were names of important items of Indian export in ancient times. Here are a few examples—**

**Anil, aniline. from Portuguese *anil*, from Arabic *al-nil*, from Sanskrit नीलीindigo.**

**Awl आरा. Dutch *aal*, German *Ahle*, Lithuanian *yla.***

**Bottom बुध्न. Dutch *bodem*, German *Boden*, Latin *fundus*, Greek *puthmen.***

**Corundum is Tamil *kurundam* from Sanskrit कुरुविन्द.**

**Flat, plate पृथु. Greek *platus*, German *platt.*  
Hone शाण.**

**Ion is from Greek *ion*, from *ienai* to go. It is the same as Sanskrit, from the root इ to go.**

**Orange. In Old French *orenge,* from earlier *(n)aranja*** (with loss of initial *n*due to

confusion with indefinite article); ***naranja* in Spanish, *naranj* in Arabic,*narang* in Persian and ultimately नारंगin Sanskrit,**

**Primusपरम. Primus is the Latin superlative form, just as परम is Sanskrit**

**superlative from पर.**

**Saccharo-शर्करा-. Med. Latin *saccharum*, Latin *saccharon,* from Greek*sakcharon,***

**which is from Pali सक्खरा, from Sanskrit शर्करा. Our granulated sugar शर्करा, travelled to the West in days when Pali was the popular speech in India. English 'sugar' and allied European, words are from Med. Latin *succarum*** (also *zugurum*), **from Arabic *sukkar,* from Persian *shakar*, from Prakrit सक्खरा, from Sanskrit शर्करा. Sacchar-, saccharate, saccharic, saccharide, saccharin, saccharoid, saccharonate, saccharonic, saccharose, sucro-, sucrose, etc., are of common use in modern scientific literature.**

**Sulphurशुल्बारि. The presence of the Indian word शुल्बारिin Europeanlanguages in the**

**form of Eng. *sulphur,* Germ. *Schwefel*, Fr. *soufre*, Latin *sulphur,sulfur*, *sulpur*, is of the utmost significance for the history of spread of Indian science.**

**Joseph William Mellor (1869-1938) has admitted in his Handbook ofInorganic**

**Chemistry that the European word sulphur has been derived from Sanskrit शुल्बारि-**

**During the last ten centuries, when India lay low and when the priestsbecame the**

**custodians of Sanskrit literature, non-religious literature perished as much by negligence as by vandalism of the foreign invaders who earned the reputation of burning Sanskrit manuscripts to warm their baths. शुल्बारि has come down to us preserved in lexicons. It occurs in the अभिधानचिन्तामणि** (भूमिकाण्ड, श्लोक १२३), **a systematically arranged lexicon of हेमचन्द्र, the great Jain encyclopaedist. शुल्बारि** (= शुल्ब+अरि) **is so called because it is the enemy of copper शुल्ब.That a copper piece when kept in sulphuric acid for some time is 'eaten up' is well-known. धातुमारी and धातुवैरीalso denote a similar idea.**

**The common word for शुल्बारि is गन्धक which has also been used,particularly in the**

**naming of 'thio' compounds.**

**Another interesting word of cultural significance is अयस् the parent of Latin*ais,* Gothic**

***ais*, old German *er*, modern German *Eisen*, English *iron.***

**Both शुल्बारिand अयस् have been given their due place of honour in thenames of**

**elements.**

**Tri-grip त्रि-ग्रभ-French, Latin, Greek *tri-*. Forgrip compare Dutch*grijpen*, German**

***greifen*, Danish *gribe*, Lithuanian *graibyti*, *griebti.***

**Tri-pod त्रि-पदी. English** *foot***, German** *Fuss***, Swedish** *fot***, Danish** *fod***, Latin***pes,* **Greek**

*podos, poùs.*

**Prefixes**

** An** (= a) **'not', used chiefly before vowels and h. It is the same asSanskrit अ- and अन्-,** **e.g., anhydride अजलेय.**

**Anti-** 'opposite, against, counter'. प्रति- also expresses the sense of 'against, in opposition to', e.g., anti-oxidant प्रति-जारणकर्ता.

 **Hypo-**from Greek, meaning 'under, beneath', is the same as Sanskrit उप- (*y* in hypo is Greek *u*Sanskrit उ; cf. Cyrus, Sanskrit कुरु, the name of an ancient Persian king. कुरु occurs in the inscriptions of Darius).

 In chemistry hypo- indicates a lower state of oxidation or *low* (usually the lowest) position in a series of compounds, e.g., hypo-chlorite उप-नीरित, hypo-bromite उप-दुरित, etc. उप- 'under, below' occurs in such words as उपकक्ष 'being under the armpit', उपग्रहण 'the act of seizing from below'.

** Meso-,** from Greek, is Latin *medius* and Sanskrit मध्य.

** Ortho-** is also from Greek. It is Sanskrit ऊर्ध्वhigh. Ortho- is employed in naming certain *higher* forms of hydration (either the *highest* form or the *highest* stable form) specially in the case of acids. The ortho- position is higher on the benzene ring than the meta- or the para- position. Ortho- indicates 1.2 position, meta- 1.3 position, and para- 1.4 position.

 **Per-,** a prefix denoting the presence in a compound of the *largest possible* or a relatively *large* proportion of the same element, or the presence of an atom having its*highest,* or a relatively *high,* valence. Our counterpart for per-is अति-, e. g., per-iodide अति-जम्बेय.

 **Pyro-अग्नि-,** is a combining form, Greek *pyr, pyros,*meaning fire अग्नि. It is used to denote fire or heat, e.g., Pyro-gen अग्नि-जन.

**Suffixes**

**-ate** is used for naming salts and esters from those acids whose names end in -ic. We have used -ईय which forms adjectives and adnouns, as in arsenate नेपालीय, borate टांकीय, carbonate प्रांगारीय, molybdate संवर्णीय, phosphate भास्वीय, silicate सैकतीय, sulphate शुल्बीय, titanate रञ्जीय, tungstate चण्डीय, uranate किरणीय, vanadate रोचीय.

** -gen,** French *-gene,* from Greek *-genes* to be born, is the same as the Sanskrit -जन from $\\sqrt{जन्}$'to be born'. It is used in forming nouns denoting a substance that produces or generates; used chiefly in chemistry, as in hydro-gen उद-जन, pyro-gen अग्नि-जन.

** -ic** signifies pertaining to'. It is the same as the common Sanskrit adjectival suffix -इक,which occurs, e.g., in लौकिक 'pertaining to लोक'. Sulphuric शुल्बारिक,  
nitric भूयिक, boric टांकिक, cupric ताम्रिक.

** -ide** is used in names of compounds, as in chloride; specifically in naming binary compounds by adding it to the contracted name of the non-metallic or negative element or radical, as in hydrogen sulphide, lead iodide.

 This suffix is originally Latin *-is*, plural -*ides,* which is a patronymic suffix, e.g., Nereid 'a daughter of Nereus'.

 Our counterpart is -एय, denoting 'origin or descent from, suitable for, etc.', as in कौन्तेय a son of कुन्ती; श्यामेय descended from श्याम; सभेय fit for an assembly सभा; व्रैहेयsown with व्रीहि;शैलेय rocky, produced in rocks शैल, etc. Examples are: antimonide अञ्जनेय, arsenide नेपाल्येय, chloride नीरेय, fluoride तरस्वेय, oxide जारेय, sulphide शुल्बेय, telluride वंगकेय.

** -idine** is a compound suffix, -ide + -ine एय + ई = एयी (the final vowel of एय has been assimilated by पररूप).

 Suffix **-ine** is variously used. It is used for forming both adjectives and nouns. It represents Latin -*inus,-ina, inum.*In English it is taken from French where *-in* is masculine and *-ine* is feminine. In English it is usually represented by -ine, only occasionally by -in.
-ine when forming nouns represents French *-ine* which is derived from Latin *-ina,* which again is from Greek *-ine,* forming feminine titles, as in Greek *eroine,* Latin *heroina,* French *heroine,* English *heroine.* In Latin *-ina*  
formed feminine abstracts from verbs as well as substantives from other sources. In chemistry -ine was first used unsystematically in forming names of extractive principles and chemical derivatives of various kinds; also, in English names given early in the nineteenth century to the four elements *chlorine, fluorine, iodine, bromine* (in French *chlore, fluor, iode, brome*). In all these, but especially in the names of extractive principles the ending -ine was by some reduced to -in. In recent systematic nomenclature the two forms have been differentiated.

** -in** is a modification of the chemical suffix -ine. It was introduced into systematic nomenclature by Hofmann in about 1860, used systematically in Walts' A Dictionary of Chemistry in 1866 and subsequently adopted by the Chemical Society for the names of neutral substances, such as glycerides, glucosides, bitter principles, colouring matters and proteids, which are thus distinguished from the names of alkaloids and basic substances in -ine. Examples, albumin, casein, fibrin, globulin, mucin, myosin, pepsin; cerebrin, chitin, chondrin, gelatin, lecithin; acetin, alizarin, aloin, arbutin, cerotin, curcumin, dextrin, haematin, indigotin, inulin, isatin, palmitin, purpurin, salicin, ulmin, vanillin. Some of these were formerly spelt with ine and in that spelling had passed into popular use before the rectification of nomenclature, esp. dextrine, gelatine, margarine,  
which are still commonly so spelt in non-scientific use. Cf. "Basic substances should invariably be indicated by names ending in -ine, as aniline, instead of anilin, the termination -in being restricted to certain neutral com- pounds, viz. glycerides, glucosides, bitter principles, and proteids, such as palmitin, amygdalin, albumin." Chemical Society, Instructions to Abstractors, sec.16 (A.D. 1881). Some chemists, however, prefer -in for basic substances also.

 We have translated the chemical suffix -ine by its counterpart feminine suffix -ई and have distinguished it from -in, which has been translated by -इ; the two remaining close to each other though still different.

** -ite** is Latin *-ilus,* an ending of past participles. Sanskrit is
-त or -इत (गणित, कथित). We have used -इत to serve the purpose, as in antimonite अञ्जनित.

 In chemistry **-ium** has been used to form the names of new metallic elements. Latin names of metals were in *-um,* e.g., *aurum, argentum, ferrum;* the names *sodium, potassium and magnesium* derived from *soda, potassa* or *potash,* and *magnesia,* were given by Davy in 1807, with the derivative form *-ium ;* and although some of the later metals have received names in *-um,* the general form is in -*ium*, as in *cadmium, lithium, palladium, titanium;* in conformity with which *aluminum* has been altered to *aluminium.* So hydrogen (उदजन) when theoretically regarded as a metal, has been called *hydrogenium* (उदजनातु ).

 In India the common word for metal is धातु. It has been abridged to
-आतुand has been used to form the names of new metallic elements.

 When, however, -ium, um are used to denote elements, which are non-metals, such as helium (which is a gas),-आतु is not used.

** -metry,** a combining form, Greek *-metria,* from*metron,* denoting an art, process, or science of measuring

(something specified). -मिति'measuring' from $\\sqrt{मा}$'to measure' is its Indian counterpart.

  -ose is short for glucose. Similarly -धु is short for मधु. In certain cases, viz., मधु-म, दुग्ध-म, -म has been used instead of -धुfor the sake of euphony.

  -ous is an adjectival suffix, meaning 'full of, abounding in, having', etc, etc. In chemistry it has been specialised to denote a valence lower than that denoted by -ic, as in nitrous, sulphurous, etc., as contrasted with nitric, sulphuric, etc.

  We have specialised the adjectival suffix -य to serve the purpose of -ous, स्वर्ण्यaurous (cf. स्वर्णिकauric).

  -yl denotes radicals. A radical is मूल.Its second part -ल has been used to serve as a suffix, just as*-yl*from Greek *hyle,* as in uranyl किरणल.

  In adding suffixes to the names of elements we have taken care to keep the length of the original word limited to two syllables, so as to avoid longish words. As a rule we have not allowed our words to exceed the length of four syllables. The practice of shortening names of elements before suffixes is well-established in English, e.g., phosphorus is shortened to phosph- before -ate, -ide, -yl.

**MINERALOGY**

  Every mineral has its distinct chemical composition. The Natural History Section of the British Museum has arranged its index of mineral species and varieties chemically. As a single major element in mineralogical nomenclature chemistry plays an important role. Hence it is to chemistry that we turned for a basis of our mineral names.

  English mineral names are mostly uncouth, uncanny, clumsy, rugged and even solitary (being unconnected). They are uninviting. They repel the layman. To the student a memory-load, that can be carried only as long and as far as it must.

  Mineralogy must remain outside the pale of our general consciousness as long as we have nothing but English terms, which can neither be pronounced nor mineralogically explained.

  Abbreviations are an outstanding feature of the chemical and other nomenclatures based thereon. They help us to incorporate, within the short span of a name, the most salient ingredients that go to form the mineral.

  The suffix *-ite* is used not only for naming minerals, but also for rocks (e. g. granite), explosives (e.g. cordite), chemical salts and esters formed from acids whose names end in *ous* (e.g. sulphite), palaeontological fossils (e. g. ammonite), and even divisions of the body (e.g. somite). Thus the English suffix is a non-specific and hence not useful as a means of distinguishing mineral names from others.

  Similarly *-lite* (equivalent to *-lith,* from Greek *lithos*'a stone') is used to denote not only a mineral, but a rock, a fossil, etc.

  The non-specific character of *-ite* is due to the start of its use at the beginning of the present era of science, when a mineral, a rock, an explosive, a salt could all be named with one suffix.

**BOTANY**

औद्भिदी stands forऔद्भिदी विद्या.औद्भिदी is a feminine adnoun from उद्भिद् a plant. उद्भिद् is derived from उद्up + $\\sqrt{भिद्}$ to break, on account of its coming out after breaking the seed and the earth (बीजं भुवं वा उद्भिनत्ति). The term was applied to Spermatophytes as well as to Sporophytes (बीज including both seeds and spores).

 उद्भिद्-विद्या has already been used in ancient times as a designation of the science of plants.

 The popular name for botany is वनस्पति शास्त्र. Etymologically वनस्पति is 'the lord of the forest'. Technically it signifies a large tree, bearing fruit apparently without blossoms, as several species of the fig, the jack tree, etc.

 औद्भिदी has been formed in accordance with the system of naming sciences in ancient times (see note on रैखिकी pp. 74-75).

 We have preferred the use of the termऔद्भिदी andother similar formations like प्राणिकी zoology, जैविकी biology, etc. to उद्भिद्-विद्या, प्राणिशास्त्र, or जीवशास्त्र because the former terms are single words and hence better suited to form compounds and derivatives. For example: botanical garden औद्भिद उद्यान is to be preferred to उद्भिद्विद्यीय उद्यान.

**Binomial and Trinomial Nomenclature  
            in Biology**

 In scientific nomenclature of plants and animals, the elements constituting a binomial or trinomial term are placed in the sequence—genus, species, sub-species, thus the full Latin name is composed of two or three words, of which the first denoting the genus is the main word. It can stand by itself. The second word which comes after the genus name is an adjective which has no  
 independent existence. The two words together constitute the name of the species. In case a species is further divided into sub-species, a third word is added on to the preceding two. It too has no independent standing. It qualifies the preceding two words taken as a whole. All the three together stand for the name of the subspecies. Thus *Ficus* is the genus of figs. *Ficus religiosa* is the peepal tree, which is a species of *Ficus*. For an example of a trinomial term we might take *Corvus*, a genus of crows. *Corvus levaillanti*, the species, and *Corvus levaillanti culminatus*, the sub-species.

 Thus in Latin nomenclature, adjectives follow substantives. It is quite common in Latin and French. But the case is reverse in English, Hindi or Japanese, in which as a rule the adjective precedes the noun. In the examples given above the English translations are 'the Religious Fig-tree' for *Ficus religiosa* and 'the Tibetan Raven' for *Corvus corox tibetanus* (Raven standing for the species *Corvus corax*).

 One might pick up similar examples from astronomy, pharmacy, etc. Latin *Ursa Major* (*Ursa* from Skt. ऋक्ष), and *Ursa Minor* are translated into English as the Great Bear (bear from Skt. भल्ल = भल्लूक) and the Little Bear respectively. Similarly *acidum boricum* in Latin is boric acid in English.

Here are a few examples from Japanese—

|-----------------|---------------------|
| Latin           | Japanese            |
| Medicago sativa | murasaki umagoyashi |

* Umagoyashi* is the Japanese name for the genus Medicago. The adjective *murasaki* precedes the noun *umagoyashi*. It may also be noted that *murasaki* is not a translation of *sativa* (eatable). It refers to another characteristic of the species, viz., the purple colour. *Medicago sativa* which is popularly known as alfalfa in U.S A. and purple medic in England, bears bluish-purple clover-like flowers.

| Latin              | Japanese    |
| *Vitis thunbergii* | *ebi dzuru* |

 Japanese *dzuru* stands for *Vitis*. *Thunbergii* is the specific adjective from a proper noun (Thunberg, name of a Swedish botanist), which has not been retained by the Japanese but replaced by their own specific adjective ebi.

| Latin                      | Japanese                |
| *Chloris sinica kittlitzi* | *ogasawara kawarachiwa* |

 In this case the Japanese have replaced the specific and the subspecific adjectives in the Latin term, which both happen to be proper nouns, by a proper name of their own viz. *ogasawara*, which is a small island in the North Pacific (although it is not the only place where this bird is found).

 In the Indian system of nomenclature, as in the Japanese, the genus name will come last and will be preceded by attributive words, serving as specific or subspecific adjectives, e.g.,

**Ocimum** (genus) **तुलसी**

**Ocimum sanctum सामान्य तुलसी**

**Corvus** (genus) **काक**

***Corvus levaillanti* कृष्ण काक  
*Corvus levaillanti culminatus* दक्षिण कृष्ण काक** (found in South India दक्षिण).

 In India we have a rich Ayurvedic literature which has preserved more than a thousand names of plants and herbs. These names have been used since immemorial times throughout the length and breadth of India.The use of these terms will make the study of systematic botany homely even for those who do not know a syllable of English.

 The Indian words have a homely atmosphere. The English words or rather the Latin words are hard as stone and cannot be easily digested. At present our boys and girls spend weeks and months of strenuous labour in trying to stuff their brains with Latin words. Botany can become a most pleasant study if it is taught with Indian words. Otherwise it will remain a neglected subject in our universities. So far as the common man is concerned, it would be idle to hope that he wi॥  
have any interest in the subject in spite of the fact that plants and flowers surround him and he would love to know as much about them as possible.  
 Botany is a descriptive science and there will be no

difficulty in spreading its knowledge far and wide to the lowest intelligence if the Latin terms are replaced by proper Indian words. The study of botany is closely connected with agriculture. We shall be able to impart botanical knowledge to our farmers and achieve good results. But the same would be unthinkable if we stick to English terms.

 It is only the research worker who has to establish contacts with the whole world, who will have to learn English and not only English but German, French, Russian, Japanese, that is, any language in which notable contributions have been made in the particular branch in which he is engaged. The research worker's labourof learning foreign languages cannot be avoided, but he too, will find it far more pleasant to get his initiation through his mother-tongue.

 Scientific study of botany is begun now-a-days at about the age of fifteen. With English terms it cannot be begun earlier. But with our own terms it can be begun at about the age of twelve, as soon as the powers of observation begin to quicken. The young students canbe taken freely into the domain of leaves, flowers, fruits and plants. It can almost become a pastime. With the aid of a microscope the pastime can pass into a thorough study.

**ZOOLOGY**

 Zoology is the science of animals: प्राणविद्या, प्राणिशास्त्र or प्राणिकी. प्राणी is the general term for animals. Etymologically it should include all life 'that breathes'. But by long usage the word has been restricted to animal life. प्राणी तु चेतनो जन्मी जन्तु-जन्यु- शरीरिणः—अमरकोश. चेतन as a synonym of प्राणी, is a highly significant word. In general, animals exhibit a higher degree of excitability or irritability to external stimuli than do plants, and most multicellular forms have a more or less distinct nervous system; in the highest species, there are manifestations of sensation and*consciousness*, not recognizable in plants. English 'animal' is from Latin *animalis*, from *anima* breath. The Sanskrit root under-lying *anima* is अन् to breathe. With प्र, we get प्राण'breath' and प्राणी 'that which breathes'.

 जीवविद्या or जैविकी is biology, which includes botany and zoology. Although historically bio- and zoo- are both akin to Sanskrit जीव, जीव has been restricted to denote life in general as against अजीव. English 'inanimate' corresponds to अप्राण in शतपथ ब्राह्मण.

 Zoology and botany are descriptive sciences. They stand on a different footing from abstruse sciences. Here terms dominate the science. Taxonomy alone would yield over two million words. In European scientific practice terms are derived from Greek and Latin. "Apparently every name of an animal used in classical Greek has been made to do service in modern nomenclature" *E. C. Jaeger*. Not only this much, Greek and Latin names have been modified and corrupted until they form a large number of designations. Calomys and Callomys, both derived from Greek *kalos*'beautiful' and *mus* 'mouse' (from Sanskrit मूष), have actually been proposed for different genera of mice. Reference may also be made to merely arbitrary groups of letters which are known as 'nonsense-names'. They have been proposed by authors who, like Ameghino, Gray, and Lataste, in making many names have found the usual sources insufficient or unsatisfactory. Examples of nonsense-names are Azema, Blarina, Degonia, Kogia and Tatera.

 A large proportion of names are compound words. While Latin offers comparatively little opportunity for making compounds, the Greek language lends itself readily to the combining together of nouns and adjectives in almost endless variety. In Latin modifications by prefixes and suffixes alone are common. Formerly compounds seem to have been in disfavour, for Illiger in 1811, following Linnaeus, rejected them. At the present time, compounds are considered not only unobjectionable but highly desirable. For without them it would be almost impossible to coin designations for the ever-increasing multitude of genera and specieswithout resorting to anagrams and arbitrary nonsense combinations of letters.

 Coues has complained that 'systematic Zoology or the practice of classification, has failed to keep pace with the principles of science, we are greatly in need of some new and sharper tools of thought". This complaint is true for European nomenclature.

Our names may be divided into two major classes:

 (1) Classical Sanskrit names— We have laboured for years to make a wide collection from Vedas, Purāṇas, Rāmāyaṇa, Mahābhārata, Suśruta, Buddhist and Jain texts as well as lexicons and general literature that is available in print. Thousands of names have thus been collected. While in many cases it is possible to identify a Sanskrit name with a modern one, there remain a good many whose exact value is yet to be ascertained.

 Ancient names are mostly names of species. The names of genus, family, order, etc., are derived by the addition of the word meaning genus, family, order, etc., *e.g., Anser* a genus, is हंस-प्रजाति (प्रजाति is our word for genus. प्रजाति is a higher category than जाति. जाति is defined as समान-प्रसवा 'which brings forth its like' i.e. a species), *Anserinae* is the subfamily हंसानुवंश (अनुवंश subfamily), *Anatidae* is the family हंस-वंश (वंश family), and *Anseres* the order हंस-गण (गण order). It is more convenient to denote genus, subfamily, family, order, etc., by a full word rather than by a suffix.

 As we have gone up so we can go down the scale and have a perfectly clear nomenclature for species. The common swan is known to European science as *Anser anser*. Our word for it is सामान्य हंस. *Anser anser* is a tautonym and if we had followed the European practice we could have translated it by हंस हंस. It would be so odd. Light has dawned on the western taxonomists and such names are now forbidden by the Inter-national Code of Botanical Nomenclature.Let us hope that the zoologists will follow suit.

 Other species of *Anser* are designated by the addition of some significant adjective, *e.g. Anser erythropus* रक्तपाद हंस (Greek *erythros* means red रक्त, while *pus* is पाद).

 (2) In the absence of ancient Sanskrit names modern Sanskrit names are derived either from Sanskrit roots with requisite suffixes or by coupling well-known Sanskrit words.

 Geographical names are sometimes made use of to particularise the locality where a species or subspecies is found. Names indicate size, form, colour, habit or some special character.

  As a rule our names are not arbitrary. None of them is nonsensical. Every one of them is designed to be helpful in understanding some distinctive feature.

 Our names have the enviable characteristic of not being removed from our literary language. In the examples given above the scientific words *Anser* and *erythropus* are unintelligible, for *Anser, erythro*, and *pus*are not used in general or literary English (English words are goose, red and foot).

 Against these their Indian counterparts हंस, रक्त and पादare known to every student of Indian literature. The vast majority of the word-elements in Indian scientific terminology partake of this feature.

 E. C. Jaeger in his Source-book of Biological Names and Terms gives twelve thousand terms, which he considers to be the essential elements from which biological names and terms are made. With us the number is far smaller.We are able to cover the entire sphere of biology (anatomy, histology, cytology, physiology, embryology, genetics, taxonomy, paleontology, bionomics, ethology) with about six thousand elements. Sanskrit is known for its high transparency. Five hundred common roots and a hundred affixes form the rock-basis of Sanskrit vocabulary. Of these 600 elements, those in frequent use are not more than 400. Formations from these 400 elements are widely current in every language of India and are known to our school boys and girls. About 1000 plant names and an equal number of animal names have been made the foundation for naming numerous genera.

 The remaining three thousand words are common nouns, adjectives, adverbs, which are used singly or in combinations to form descriptive words. Out of these three thousand, no less than 2500 are current in literary prose, poetry and newspapers. What the Indian science student has to do is to acquaint himself with the process of analysis and synthesis of roots and affixes, and a few rules of composition of words and word-elements. TheIndian student can take it up as a study or he can go on mastering words as they come. While studying science through English, an Indian student hardly ever stops to grasp a scientific term.He takes it as a sound and spelling unit, and remains unconcerned with its etymology. Its meaning he knows from the definition. The Indian student is handicapped by his ignorance of Anglo-Saxon, French, Latin or Greek and hence is unable to probe into its heart. When words are not understood spellings are a great memory-burden. I have quoted above a few nonsense words. To the Indian student, ignorant of the origins of English words, biological terms in general are nonsensical conglomerations of syllables.

 In the East, we can derive instruction from the Japanese system of biological nomenclature. We reproduce a few specimen names from the Bulletin of the Biogeographical Society of Japan, Vol. I, No. 3, June 1930. This volume describes the bird-life of Bonin and the neighbouring islands.

*Corvidae = Jap. karasuka* (*karasu* 'crow'*, -ka* 'family').  
*Fringillidae = Jap. atorika* (*-ka* 'family').

*Chloris sinica kittlitzi = Jap. ogasawara kawarahiwa* (*ogasawara* 'Bonin Island'. Note that the European proper name has been replaced).

*Chloris sinica seebohmi = Jap. iwoto kawarahiwa* (*iwoto* 'Volcano Island'. Here and in the previous name the trinomial nomenclature has been replaced by the binomial. The proper name *seebohmi* has been deleted).

*Zosteropidae = Jap. mejiroka* (*-ka* 'family').

*Zosterops japonicus = Jap. bonin mejiro* (The popular Japanese name is *mejiro*).  
*Zosterops japonicus alani = Jap. iwoto mejiro* (*iwoto* 'Volcano Island'. Its popular name in Japanese is *mejiro*).

*Pycnonotidae = Jap. hiyodorika* (*-ka* 'family').

*Microscalis amaurotis squamiceps = Jap. ogasawara hiyodori* (ogasawara 'Bonin Island'. The popular name in Japanese is *hiyodori*).  
*Microscalis amaurotis magnirostris = Jap. hashibuto hiyodori* (the Japanese popular name in the Volcano Island is *hiyodori*).

*Sylviidae = Jap. uguisuka* (*-ka* 'family').

*Horornis diphone diphone = Jap. ogasawara uguisu* (its popular name in Japanese is *uguisu*).  
*Horornis diphone iwootoensis = Jap. iwoto uguisu.*

*Turdidae =* Jap. *tsugumika* (*-ka* 'family').

*Aegithocichla terrestris =* Jap. *shima gabicho* (*shima* 'island' as contrasted with water; cf. *terrestris* in the Latin name).

*Accipitridae*=Jap. *tukaka* (*taka* 'hawk, falcon'+-ka'family').

*Buteo japonicus toyoshimai =* Jap. *ogasawara nosuri.*

*Falconidae =* Jap. *hayabusaka* (hayabusa 'falcon'+-ka 'family').

*Falco peregrinus fruitii=*Jap. *shima hayabusa* (*shima* 'island', *hayabusa* 'falcon').

**AVIFAUNA**

 India, Burma and Ceylon contain one of the richest and most varied avifaunas on: the face of the globe. Covering some 40 degrees of latitude and about the same of longitude, they enclose within their boundaries a vast diversity of climate and physical features. These range from the dry, scorching sandy deserts of Sindh and Rajputana and the humid evergreen rain forests of Assam and the South Western Ghats, to the region of glaciers and eternal snow in the mighty Himalayas. Smooth wide spaces of depressed river basins, either sandy, dry and sun-scorched or cultivated, or water-logged under a steamy moisture-laden atmosphere (the terai) lie at the base of the northern ramparts. The great Central Indian and Deccan Plateaux succeed the fertile alluvial Gangetic Plain and are flanked on the west by the broken crags and castellated outlines of the ridges of the Western Ghats which overlook the Arabian Sea and continue southward in gentle, smoothly-roundedslopes of green uplands—the Nilgiri and other hills of Southern India.

 Altogether there are 24 hundred species and sub-species which have been described with great patience and scholarship by E. C. Stuart Baker in the 8 volumes of Indian Fauna (Birds). They were published from July 1922 to September 1930. Each bird has been given a bi- or a tri-nomial designation. According to the scientific practice in the West the names are in Latin. Each Latin name is followed by an English name. The English names are not always translations of Latin.\* In the Latin nomenclature the words signifying the genus come first and those signifying the sub-species come last, the words for the species being placed in between. In English the order has been reversed, the sub-specics coming first and the genus coming last.

 Binomial or trinomial system of naming plants and animats is a recent scientific device. In ancient times we have single names standing mostly for species. Our ancestors lived with nature and loved plants, animals, rivers and mountains. They observed and named animals with loving care. We find hundreds of names of birds in Sanskrit literature.

 In the present work ancient names have been fitted into the trinomial scientific scheme. These names, while serving the needs of scientific classification would be found to be more significant, easier to grasp, simpler to pronounce and hence incomparably quicker to remember than their Latin counterparts. In certain quarters it has sometimes been felt that Latin names be left untranslated. But this view loses all force when we find that foreigners who came to India from a distance of six thousand miles thought it practicable to append to every Latin name an English trinomial designation so that their compatriots could better study and appreciate Indian birds than could ever be done through the mouth-filling mass of vowels and consonants known as scientific names. The Indian names, more-over, correlate the present with the past. Our names have a pedigree and hence future scientific studies will not be removed from the past achievements of the race. It does not, however, mean that Indian scientists will not acquire a knowledge of Latin names. Research workers will have to get acquainted with Latin and English names when they are studying the works written by foreign scholars.

 Sanskrit words are a fascinating study. Sanskrit is known for being the most transparent language.Seven or eight words out of ten are crystal clear in the basic idea on which they have been founded. They embody the observations and the reactions of our forefathers to  
their surroundings.

 The general word for a bird is पक्षिन् 'feathered'. Birds are conspicuously different from all other classes in that they possess feathers. This idea of a feathered creature was constantly before the mind's eye and hence besides पक्षिन् we have such other words as पक्षधर and पक्षालु. It was further extended to पक्षगम 'going with the help of feathers' and पक्षवाहन 'having feathers as the vehicle'. पत्र,the parent of English 'feather', and पतत्र, both from पत्'to fly', and signifying 'feather' have yielded some more synonyms—पत्रिन्, पत्र-वाह, पत्रि-वाह, पत्र-रथ and पतत्रिन्.

 Another designation of birds is द्विपाद 'biped'.अण्डज 'oviparous', द्विज 'born twice—once the egg and then the young one from the egg', द्विजाति, अनेकज were constantly used to signify a bird. But this characteristic is not an exclusive one. It is shared by birds with reptiles and other creatures.

 तपस 'warm' is a curious epithet for a bird. Of course we know that the temperature of the body of a bird is 2 to 14 degrees higher than that of mammals. The high temperature is connected with the large pro-

\* Trinomial names are sometimes rendered by binomials-

Lat.—*Brachy-pteryx major albi ventris*.  
Eng.—*The White-bellied Short-wing*.

 Here *major* is left out. The rest is faithfully rendered.  
 Proper names of places and persons are freely replaced. There is no sacrosanctity about them—

Lat.—Cinclus pallassii tenuirostris.  
Eng.—The Indian Brown Disper.  
Lat.—*Tickellia hodgsoni*.  
Eng.—*The Broad-billed Flycatcher-Warbler*.  
Lat.—*Acrocephalus concinens stevensi*.  
Eng.—*The Plains Paddy-field Warbler*.

 This Reed-Warbler was discovered breeding by Mr. and Mrs. H. Stevens in Lakhimpur, but while translating in English it was not considered necessary to retain the discoverer's name.

portion of muscle, and the conservation of heat is secured by the nonconducting plumage.

 शकुन or its synonyms शकुन्त, शकुनक, शकुनि, शकुन्ति are derived from the root शक् 'to be strong', the root from which we get the common words शक्ति 'power' and शक्र Indra 'the mighty'. One of the Vedic words for bird is वाजिन् 'powerful' from वाज 'strength'. These are highly expressive of the great invigoration of life which is contributed to birds by a supply of purely arterial blood pumped by the four-chambered heart.

 With flight is connected the more lightly built skeleton, the sternum acquiring a keel for the insertion of the muscles of flight, the neck becoming long and supple and the beak taking on the work of a hand. This is beautifully expressed by the Sanskrit term त्रोटकहस्त (त्रोटक 'beak', हस्त 'hand').

 नीडज, नीडोद्भत्र 'born in a nest', नीडिन् 'having a nest', वृक्षगृह, वृक्षावास, अगौकस्, नगौकस् 'making their homes in trees', तरुशायिन् 'resting on trees' and again कुलायस्थ 'nest-dweller' are popular epithets and are used as regular synonyms of पक्षिन्.

 Insects, bats, birds and the extinct Pterodactyls in which a fold of skin was extended on the greatly elongated outermost or fifth finger, are all included in the term पतंग 'which move by flying'.

 वा 'to blow' gives वायु, वात for 'wind' and a series of words for 'bird' वि, वी, वीक, वे, वयस्, वयस, वाय, वायस. From वि is derived the Sanskrit word for aerial car विमान 'made to the measure of birds'. The wings of birds combine the functions of propellers and planes.

 The value of flight is obvious but it may be useful to recall some of the different ways in which it has justified itself in the struggle for existence. It gives its possessor a new safety and independence, expressed in the Sanskrit word यथेष्टचारिन्. It enables them to follow food and to seek water over long distances. It helps them to secure the well-being of their offspring by building nests in places often inaccessible except to enemies able to fly or climb. The power of flight has given to birds a unique power of annihilating distance, of evading the winter, of having two summers in the year, of having two homes, of changing their season in a night. In seeking out suitable feeding-places and breeding-places neither space nor time present obstacles to the flying bird.

 Teeth are absent in modern birds.The Sanskrit poet has alluded to this feature by रसना-रद. Their absence is compensated for by the horny bill covering the jaws अस्थितुण्ड, कीकस-मुख, कीकमास्य (अस्थि- and कीकस- both signify 'bony'). It often has a sharp edge and a hooked tip; it varies from a massive crushing instrument in the toucan to a delicate probe in the humming bird. The variety of type should be considered in the light of the fact that the forelimb has been surrendered to making a wing, and that the bird's jaws have to discharge duties which in mammals usually fall to the hands. Hence the name त्रोटक-हस्त referred to before. It would be profitable to pursue a paragraph or two to realise the value of the bill as a hand.

 A generalized bill may be illustrated by the crow and its allies—strong, pointed, somewhat triangular in section. Shortening, sharpening and curving of such a bill would yield the predatory type of hawk and eagle—quick to give the death-blow by piercing the skull or cutting the jugular vein, also well suited for rapid skinning and plucking, and for drawing out strips of flesh from the body. It is interesting to see an eagle deftly run down the backbone of a fish with its bill, dislocating the vertebrae. Somewhat of the same type are the bills of the owls and the parrots, though the former are carnivorous and the latter vegetarian. The parrot's beak has a movable hinge between the premaxillae and the front of the skull, and there are often strong file-like roughnesses to the inside of the bill, which serve in gnawing nuts or grinding hard seeds. Not very remote are the broadly conical strong bills characteristic of the finches, suited for breaking capsules and splitting seeds.

 On another line are the delicate slender types, familiar in warblers, suited for dealing with small insects, with a climax in the elongated slender bills of humming birds. Not far removed, though used in a different way, are the elongated narrow bills of curlews, snipe, avocet and woodcock, for probing in mud, sand and the like. In a very different direction are the broad bills of ducks and geese, for sifting the mud and cropping vegetation, and on this line might be placed the broad bills of some storks and herons, and the spatulate type of the spoonbill. Also broadened out, but kept very short, are the insect-catching bills of nightjar and swift. A slight specialization of the rook-type leads to the sharp form of bill seen in snake-birds, herons and bitterns. Lateral compression in puffin and razor-bill reaches an extreme in the long, high knife-blade of the skimmer (Rhynchops), a tropical relative of the terns. This bird flies very close to the surface and skims the water with the mandible which is longer than the upper jaw. When the knife edge of the mandible touches a small fish or crustacean it tilts the booty into the open mouth. The skimmer or scissor-bill is also said to skim soft mud. There are many strange types, such as that of the crossbill, where the points of the upper and lower halves of the beak cross one another when at rest, a position that occurs as an abnormality in some birds, such as crows. The peculiarity is utilized by the crossbill in the exceedingly rapid extraction of the seeds of fir-cones, a deft manipulation in which the tongue assists. In the wry-bill plover of New Zealand the bill is turned to the right-hand side, and it is interesting to notice that a one-sided twist is occasionally seen in an individual oyster-catcher. In the flamingo the whole beak is bent almost at right angles on itself, half-way down its length, and is thrust upside down into the mud, where it searches for small molluses and the like. The kiwi is the only bird in which the nostrils open at the tip of the bill. In the huia, another New Zealand rarity, there is sex-dimorphism in the bill. According to Alfred Newton, the male uses his short, strong, almost straight bill to chisel holes in decaying wood where grubs may lurk, while the female uses her much longer, decurved and slender bill to probe into crevices. But when he, having discovered a grub in his excavations, is unable to reach it, she utilizes the opportunity.

 अंगु and अंजस् (from अंजू, उणादि) imply intensity of motion. Going through the sky is a pet name of the Sanskrit poets and is expressed in various ways ख-ग (ख sky), खगम, खचर, खेचर, विहग, विहायस्, विहायस, विहंगम, विहग, विहंगक, द्युग (द्यु sky), द्योभूमि 'for whom the sky is the earth', नभश्वर, नभसंगम, अम्बरचर, उपरिचर, अभ्रग 'going-among the clouds', गगनचर, गगनेचर, व्योमचारिन्, अन्तरिक्षग, अन्तरिक्षचर, आकाशचारिन्, आकाशग, वियच्चारिन्.

 वातगामिन् 'going with the wind' is a significant designation. Besides ordinary flight, there is gliding—when the bird, having attained to a certain velocity, rests on its oars for a while; or having attained a certain height descends to the ground without any stroke of its wings.

 वातगामिन् may also refer to the velocity of flight, 'going as quick as the wind'. The most accurate measurements of flight of birds have been made from aeroplanes on birds keeping level with the machine and flying in the same direction. Thus measured by Meinertzhagen, small song-birds show an average rate of 20-37 m. per hour, crows 31-45, ducks 44-59, plovers 40-51; but these may be increased in exceptional circumstances, and an occasional rate of 100 m. an hour is quite credible.

 Sanskrit literature is full of bird-lore. In the Ṛigveda we read यो वेद वीनां पदमन्तरिक्षे पतताम् 'Varuṇa, who knows the paths of birds flying through the sky'. वीनां पदं reminds us of वणिक्पथ, नौपथ and पक्षिपथ 'the bird-migration routes'.

 From पत् 'to fly', there is a host of words. That they all mean a bird is not certain. Some of them definitely signify, besides a bird, flying insects. The simplest formations are पतत्, पतम, पतंग, पतंगम and पतंगिन् 'those who go flying'. पत्र masculine or neuter, besides being used for a feather, signifies a flying creature as well. पतेर is still another word. उत्पत 'flying high or up'. There are three words which have been formed by the addition of desiderative suffixes—पित्सत्, पिपतिषु, पिपतिषत्. Here the desideratives might signify birds which are constantly on the wing.

 The procedure followed in giving scientific names to birds is a simple one. If there be an ancient name of a species or subspecies, it is made the basis of the name of the genus (प्रजाति, and of the family if that be derived from the genus) to which it belongs, e. g., काक, the Common Indian House-Crow, yields काक-प्रजाति*Corvus*, the genus, and further काक-वंश *Corvidae*, the family.

 In the trinomial system the Common Indian House-Crow, itself, is the subspecies *Corvus splendenssplendens* सामान्य भस्मच्छवि काक. *Corvus splendens*, the species, is characterised by the ashy-brown colour of its nape, ear-coverts, head, upper back and breast. भस्म-च्छविsignifies the ashy-brown shade (भस्म ash, छवि colour). *Corvus splendens* भस्मच्छवि काक has four sub-species:*splendens, zugmayeri, insolens* and *protegatus*. The first, being the starting point, is designated by prefixing सामान्य'common' to भस्मच्छवि काक. The second, third and fourth sub-species are distributed over Sindh, Burma and Ceylon respectively and hence are particularised by prefixing सिन्धु, ब्राह्म and लंका respectively. Thus—

*Corvus splendens spiendens* **सामान्य भस्मच्छवि काक**  
*Corvus splendens zugmayeri* **सिन्धु भस्मच्छवि काक**  
*Corvus splendens insolens* **ब्राह्य भस्मच्छवि काक**  
*Corvus splendens protegatus* **लंका भस्मच्छवि काक**

 Each element of the Indian name is clear in connotation.

 Some other species of *Corvus***काक** are-

1.*Corvus corax* **द्रोण काक** (ancient word)  
2.*Corvus levaillanii* **कृष्ण काक** (ancient word)  
3.*Corvus frugilegus* **संघचारी काक** (संघचारी 'gregarious'—ancient word).

 A species has one, two or more sub-species, of which many are found in a particular geographical zone, and hence defined by it. Thus—

*Corvus levaillanti levaillanti* **सामान्य कृष्ण काक**  
*Corvus levaillanti culminatus* **दक्षिण कृष्ण काक** (found in दक्षिण Southern India)  
*Corvus levaillanti intermedius* **हिमालय कृष्ण काक** (found in the Himalayas).

 Alongside the Latin scientific names there are popular English names for every bird. The English names, at times, follow Latin closely, but often they follow a different line. They may even be binomial, while the Latin is trinomial—(Latin) *Oriolus trailli trailli*—(English) *Marcon Oriole*.

 The English generic names are not necessarily co-extensive with Latin, e.g., *Pipit* covers *Anthus* and*Oreocorys*.

 After long experience we decided to provide Indian words not only for Latin names but also for popular English names. Sanskrit language and literature are rich enough to serve both.

 We have been able to use ancient words by the hundred (normally a specification to this effect is registered within parentheses). While doing so we had before us the European love for their past. *Edmund C. Jaeger*discussing the origin of biological generic names records:

 "Apparently every name of an animal used in classical Greek has been made to do service in modern nomenclature".

 He goes on further:

"And these have been modified until they form a large number of the designations in common use...

 "A large number of names comprise derivatives and compounds of the same Greek or Latin words, These names may have different forms".

 We, on our part, have not been able to use every Sanskrit name.

 Sanskrit names are bearers of an imagery, all their own.  
 When, however, ancient names were not available, we followed the path of Pāṇini, Kātyāyana and Patañjali, and devised अन्वर्थ names, e.g.

चञ्चला *Fulvetta* (the birds of this genus are restlessचञ्चल)  
दीर्घ-पुच्छ*Heterophasa* (their tail पुच्छ isextraordinarily long दीर्घ)  
भेक-मुख *Batracho-stomus* (the Greek word has been literally rendered into English 'Frog-mouth' and Sanskrit भेक-मुख).  
मशकारि *Culici-capa* (culicis मशक, English 'Flycatcher'-अरि 'enemy')  
वृक्ष-सर्पी *Certhia* (वृक्ष tree, सर्पी creeper)  
हिम-चटक *Montifringilla* (they are all Snow हिम Finches)  
सित-नयन *Zosterops* (they have a white सित ring round the eye नयन).

 Modern names in North and South Indian languages have been of immense value.

**MAMMALIA**

 In our work of finding Indian counterparts for the vast and varied scientific names, we have been greatly helped by the huge store of names recorded in our ancient literature: hardly is there a family or an important genus which has not been represented therein, as will be evident from the perusal of the explanatory notes that follow the suprageneric or generic names. For a single animal we have a variety of names which is unsurpassed by Greek and Latin singly or both combined.

In accordance with scientific requirements each mammal has a bi- or tri-nomial Latin designation in the West. In the present work ancient names have been fitted into the trinomial scheme.

 Our method of naming is as follows. When there is an ancient word corresponding to the Latin or other European etymon, that is used as a base for the generic and supra-generic nomenclature derived therefrom. Thus, hyaena is तरक्षु, a word which occurs in the Vājasaneyi-Saṃhitā 24.40 and Maitrāyaṇīya-Saṃhitā 3.14.21, Rāmāyaṇa, Mahābhārata, Susruta, etc. Its derivative *taras* is used in Marathi and Sindhi.Naturally, the genus *Hyaena* will be तरक्षु-प्रजाति, the family *Hyaenidae*तरक्षु-वंश. Similarly, *Herpestidae* the family of mongooses will be नकुल-वंश, its subfamily *Herpestinae* नकुलानुवंश (अनु- sub-+वंश family), its genus *Herpestes*नकुल-प्रजाति. From नकुल is derived Hindi नेवला, Kashmiri नूल, Assamese, Bengali नेउल. It may be noted that the Greeks seem to have had no word for 'mongoose', whence it has been designated as *herpēstēs* 'a creeping thing'. The species of the genus *Herpestes* have been named in our system after their characteristics: *H. edwardsii*which has a speckled (बिन्दुकित) pelage is बिन्दुकितनकुल.It has four sub-species. The sub-species "symbolize the geographical and environmental variants of a species". Hence they follow their distribution: *H. edwardsii nyula*is found in Northern India (उत्तर), so it is उत्तर बिन्दुकित नकुल. *H. edwardsii ferrugincus* is found mainly in the desert (मरु) districts of N. W. India: hence मरुबिन्दुकित नकुल; *H. edwardsii edwardsii*is सामान्य बिन्दुकित नकुल being the starting-point (सामान्य common); *H. edwardsii lanka*, the Ceylonese (लंका) Grey Mongoose, is लंका बिन्दुकित नकुल.

 In Neo-Latin an adjective follows the noun it qualifies. For example, in astronomy, *Ursa major* and*Ursa minor* for Great Bear and Little Bear respectively; *corpora adiposa, corpora amylacea* in medicine; *acidum boricum, acidum nitricum, acidum tannicum, borax purificatus, aqua anisi concentrata* 'concentrated anise water', *aqua foenicula concentrata*, etc, etc. In taxonomy too, the specific element of a scientific name, which is an adjective or has an adjectival function, comes after the generic term. In the English names accompanying the Latin ones, the adjective precedes the noun it qualifies in accordance with English grammar, e.g. *Talpa micrura* (*micr-* 'small'+*ura*'-tailed') is the White-tailed Mole, *Soriculus macrurus* is the Long-tailed Shrew (*macr-* long' + urus '-tailed'), *Crocidura leucogenys* (*leuco-* 'white'+*genys* 'cheek') is the White-cheeked Shrew, *Chimarrogale himalayica* is the Himalayan Water-Shrew.

 In the Indian nomenclature, the genus-species sequence is the adjective-noun one, in keeping with our grammatical structure:

*Erinaceus megalotis* **महाकर्ण जाहक** (megal- महा+-otis कर्ण; is from Varāhamihira's Bṛhatsaṃhitā and from it is derived its Sindhi name *jaho*).

 Similarly the following specics of the genus *Cynopterus* **बभ्रुपत्र-प्रजाति—**

*C. marginatus* **दीर्घकर्णबभ्रुपत्र** (characterized by long दीर्घ ears कर्ण)  
*C. brachyotus* **लघुकर्ण बभ्रुपत्र** (*brachy-* लघु+-*otus* कर्ण)  
*C. brachysoma***पीनबभ्रुपत्र** (*brachy*- short+*soma* body. The body is very short and thick

पीन. Its popular English name is the Thick-bodied Fruit-Bat).

 Latin specific names have often an English name. In many instances, names of persons are replaced by a descriptive term in English: *Vesperugo leisleri* is the Hairy-armed Bat, *Mus berdmorei* is the Grey Rat, *Mus blanfordi* is the White-tailed Rat, *Mus jerdoni* is the Bicoloured Rat, *Mus gleadowi* is the Sand.coloured Rat *Nesocia hardwickei* is the Short-tailed Mole-Rat. Such English names have been of great help to us in replacing  
meaningless personal names by significant characteristics  
and avoiding unnecessary burden of *eponyms*. Through-out we have taken pains to see that our names reflect scientific observations in a greater measure than Latin or English ones. It will be interesting to note that in revising and systematizing the terminology in medicine, eponyms are being replaced by significant terms. To quote Prof. O. H. Perry Pepper, Medical Etymology (Philadelphia, 1949):

 "Unfortunately for all of us, eponyms are very numerous in medical terminology. Taken out of any historical context they are meaningless, and hence hard to remember. Medical terminology is bad enough without the added burden of eponyms. The bacterial cause of typhoid fever can be easily remembered as long as the organism is named the *Bacillus typhosus*, or even more easily if we discard the Latin terms, but to christen this same bacterium with the diminutive eponym*Eberthella* is just making trouble for countless students yet unmatriculated. It may be very proper to honor the discoveries of Eberth, Salmon, Bruce, Shiga, Escherich, and Nocard, but it is tough on the student.

 "Most eponyms perpetuate the name of the discoverer or the first describer of some structure or phenomenon, but few survive long for this reason alone. *As a rule, an eponym remains in use only if no satisfactory term can be found to take its place*. For example, no brief adequate term has ever been suggested to describe all that is conveyed by the ancient eponym "Hippocratic facies", with the sunken cheeks and pinched nose of the terminal moribund state. Nor have good substitutes come forward to push many of the anatomical eponyms into the discard. Fallopio (1523-1562) and Eustachio (1520-1574) still plague us with their respective tubes. The term "Broca's area" also is no help with our medical speech.

 "Eponymic titles are given to diseases only for lack of something better. The name Bright's disease persisted longer than it should have, and the name Hodgkin's disease is still used because of our ignorance, in spite of the cumbersome substitutes suggested. *Such eponyms persist and defy the advance of knowledge, but must always lose out in the end, when science learns enough to justify the coining of some appropriate term. Often an eponym is a clear indication of our ignorance, and constitutes a challenge to the investigator to rid our terminology of one more eponym. Any disease designated by an eponym is a good subject for research.*

 "Eponyms also open the way to confusion. Some term a certain condition Graves' disease, others call it Parry's disease—both names had best be relegated to the histories of medicine. The supraclavicular node, enlarged by neoplastic metastasis, is in some parts called the Ewald, the Belin, or the Virchow node. Why not discard them all and adopt the other term—the signal node? Then there are two different Addison's diseases, and several conditions named after Sir James Paget.

 "Our vocabulary of eponyms is constantly changing: some are dying, others are being born. A few apparently are going to live forever—caesarean and roentgen, for example. One might guess that the tetralogyof Fallot would have a long life, for the condition defies a short descriptive name. On the other hand, we should soon be rid of Gaucher's disease, Banti's disease, and many others, including the many so-named muscular dystrophies. In fact, the author likes to hope that fewer eponyms are forced on the student today than had to be learned in his student days; the eponyms of the eye signs of thyroid disease, and Niemeyer's pill and Niemeyer's dictum, are gone, among others". (pp. 11, 12)

 If English eponyms are "tough" on the English student how much "tougher" are they on the Indian student !

 Besides the eponyms, we have the toponyms which are based on the names of countries, mountains, towns, rivers, etc. They are not confined to subspecies. They are extended to species too.

 Geographical and personal names are not a scientific necessity. It is a matter of convenience. Latin may have them, English may not, and vice versa. While we have used geographical names, such as are known to our literature and people, we have found descriptive words more intelligible than foreign toponyms.

 Our civilisation was developed in the midst of tropical nature. Our forefathers had deep love and keen observation of their surroundings. Such words as व्याघ्र,सिंह, द्वीपी, वृक, हलीक्ष्ण, तरक्षु, लोपाश, कशीका, छगल and गो, go back to the earliest period of our documented history, namely the Vedic scriptures. Our lexicons, ancient and mediaeval are rich in faunic names.

 In the West names have been derived from Greek and Latin. It is the duty of the Indian scientist to take care of the achievements of his race, to lift them out of oblivion and to bring them to life.

 Majority of our generic and suprageneric terms are based on ancient names: *Hylobatidae* (family) शाखामृग-वंश (शाखामृग occurs as early as the महाभारत), *Colobidae* (family) लांगूलि-वंश (लांगूलीis an ancient word), *Kasi* (genus) कीश-प्रजाति (कीश occurs in पञ्चतन्त्र, भागवतपुराण and the रामचरितमानस of तुलसीदास). The genus *Nycticebus* is ह्रीकु-प्रजाति, ह्रीकु being a synonym for loris in शब्दरत्नाकर and अभिधानचिन्तामणि, while its related genus *Loris* is designated by लज्जालुक, another term from the शब्दरत्नाकर. So also the genus of the snow-leopard *Uncia* has an ancient name चित्रव्याघ्र-प्रजाति. In the same way पिण्डारक-प्रजाति for *Neofelis*, हलीक्ष्ण-प्रजाति for *Lynx* (हलीक्षण occurs in the तैत्तिरीयसंहिता), चित्रक-प्रजाति for *Acinonyx* (from चित्रक is derived the Hindi word चीता). The family *Mustelidae* is कुमारी-वंश, कुमारी occurring in the वैजयन्ती-कोष, which is rich in faunic names. The family *Tapiridae* is लुलाप-वंश, लुलापbeing from the अमरकोष. Again, the genus *Nemorhaedus*derives its name गोकर्ण-प्रजाति from गोकर्ण used in the famous medical works of Caraka and Suśruta.These instances will amply illustrate to what extent we have been fortunate in being the inheritors of a literature singularly rich in the observation of nature.

 We have made use of synonyins to designate different genera:

|                 |                  |
|:---------------:|:----------------:|
| मर्कट (प्रजाति) | *Trachypithecus* |
|    प्लवंगाः     |   *Cynomorpha*   |
|  कीश (प्रजाति)  |      *Kasi*      |

Out of twenty generic and suprageneric names in the Primates for only these three have we had recourse tosynonyms. The rest are image-delineations within the limits of two to five syllables.

 Identification of ancient names has not always been easy. There are those about which there is no difference of opinion, while there are many others which had to be identified anew. Here lexicons, commentaries and modern Indian languages have come to our help.

 A few important words of Greek and Latin go back as genetic relatives of Sanskrit which, incidentally, is far older and richer than either Greek or Latin or even both taken together, e.g. *panther* is Sanskrit पुण्डरिक, *otter*is उद्र, Lat. *ovis* is अवि. From them have been formed: *Pantherinac* पुण्डरीकानुवंश (अनुवंश subfamily), *Panthera* (genus) पुण्डरीक-प्रजाति, *Panthera pardus* पृदाकु पुण्डरीक, *Ovis*(genus) अवि-प्रजाति. Weasel is akin to Sanskrit विस्र, from which we get its name विस्रा with the specificatory feminine suffix.Greek *pardos* has been connected with Sanskrit पृदाकु by Webster, while the prefix *pro* is etymologically the same as Sanskrit प्र. Hence *Pardo-felis*and *Pro- felis* arerespectively translated into Sanskrit पृदाकु-विडाल and प्र-विडाल.

 Latin *ursus* and Greek *arktos* are the same as Sanskrit ऋक्ष. Hence the series:

|               |                     |
|:-------------:|:-------------------:|
|   *Ursidac*   |      ऋक्ष-वंश       |
|    *Ursus*    |   ऋक्ष- (प्रजाति)   |
|  *Melursus*   | मन्दऋक्ष- (प्रजाति) |
| *Selenarctos* |  वनऋक्ष- (प्रजाति)  |
|  *Helarctos*  | शाखा ऋक्ष (प्रजाति) |

 Several ancient names have come down to us in a changed garb in modern Indian languages. These words have enabled us to identify ancient names and to avail of them in the present nomenclature. A few instances will suffice: Hindi कसिया is from कशीकाwhich occurs in the ऋग्वेद. From it we get the subfamily *Martinae* कशीकानुवंश, and the genus Martes कशीका प्रजाति. Sindhi *jaho* gives us the identification of जाहक 'hedgehog', from which we have जाहक-वंश *Erinaccidae*, जाहकानुवंश *Erinaceinac*, and जाहक-प्रजाति *Erinaceus*. The genus *Pleropus* is वाग्गुद-प्रजाति, its family वाग्गुद-वंश. वाग्गुद is from मनुस्मृतिand it is found as the second member of the Marathi compound-wordवटवाघूल. The genus*Rhinoceros* is गण्डक-प्रजाति, its family *Rhinocerotidae* गण्डक-वंश; fromगण्डक is derived Hindi गेंडा. In Assamese *deo-chagal* is used for the Goral, for which it has been retained.

 Here we may also point out a few instances where Sanskrit equivalents have derivatives in modern Indian languages:

Acinonyx (Gk. *akaina* 'thorn'+*onyx* 'claw') चित्रक-प्रजाति (from चित्रक is derived Hindi चीता).  
Herpesles नकुल-प्रजाति (from नकुल is derived Hindi नेवला).

 In cases, where a Latin scientific name is based on a distinctive characteristic, the same has been made the basis of the Indian name. The group Mammalia स्तनिवर्गitself is an example of the isonymic principle, Lat. *mamma* 'breast' स्तन. Catarhini is a group having nostrils directed downward (*cata*- down अधो+*rhinos* 'nose' नास+group समूह) which gives its Indian equivalent अधोनास-समूह. Similarly, the section Anthropo-morpha containing the Man-like Apes is नररुपाः (नर- corresponding to *anthropo*- and रुपाः to -*morpha*). In the genera *Pardofelis*and *Profelis* Lat.*felis* 'cat' is विडाल, Gk. *pardos* 'panther' is Sanskrit पृदाकु(see Webster) and Gk. *pro* is Sanskrit प्र; so the two are respectively पृदाकुविडाल and प्रविडाल. The genus of the Vampire Bats, *Megaderma* is composed of Gk. *mega*- 'great' विशाल and *derma* 'skin, leather' पत्र 'wing'; so its Indian name is विशालपत्र-प्रजाति(प्रजाति genus). The genus *Synotus* is from *syn*- 'together' युक्त+*otus* 'ear' कर्ण, its ears being united at the base (युक्तकर्ण-प्रजाति). Similar is the relationship of तनुकर्ण-प्रजाति to *Microtus* (genus): micro- तनु+-otus -कर्ण. *Tetracerus* thegenusof the Four-horned Aṅtelope, is the derivationally identical चतुःशृंग-प्रजाति (*tetra*- चतुः+*cerus* श्रृंग).

 Besides the above two categories of archeonyms or words based on their ancient Indian name, and isonyms or words having the same etymological basis as the Latin word, there is another category, the euonyms, which represent an improvement on the Latin name, being more expressive and suitable than the latter.

They clearly bring out the characteristic feature. नर- वानर-गण, the euonym for Primates defines the scope of the order in an unambiguous manner viz. that 'it includes a 'man' and a 'monkey'. The genus *Presbytis*derived from Greek *presbytis* 'an old woman' indicates no precise feature of the animal, while our word श्वेतोरु-प्रजाति immediately gives clue to the fact that the inner side of the thigh ऊरु is conspicuously white. The Indian equivalent नखाकोचि-अनुगण for the suborder *Aeluroidea*gives the predominant characteristic of its having retractile claws. *Carponycteris* is दीर्घचिह्न-प्रजाति which at once brings out its main feature of having a long tongue. The genus of Leaf-nosed Bats, *Hipposiderus* is पुष्पनास-प्रजाति, a word which graphically portrays the more or less square or oblong and complicated noseleaf looking like a flower-like appendage on the nose. *Pecora* is the plural of Latin *pecus* 'cattle', which is akin to Sanskrit पशु. It connotes the typical (प्र) ruminants and is hence प्ररोमन्थिनः(√रोमन्थ् 'to ruminate'), a better defined and more expressive term.

 In the Latin terminology, several widely separated genera are distinguished only by an easily confusable spelling- or gender-differentiation. Such confusions are absent from the Indian system. For instance, the genus of weasels is *Mustela* and the genus of dogfishes *Mustelus*, the family of both being spelt alike: *Mustelidae*. Another glaring instance of such confusion is afforded by the homo-etymonic genera *Peramus* and *Peramys*, which belong to entirely different subclassses, the Pantotheria and Metatheria respectively; two separate words have been provided for them in the Indian terminology. To take yet another instance of two generic names, distinguished only by a tantalizing difference in spelling: *Hemigalus* and *Hemigaleus*. The former is a genus of palm-civets whence termed तरुपूतीक-प्रजाति (पूतीक for civet occurs in the कल्पद्रुकोष), while the latter is a genus of sharks, the सामिग्राह-प्रजाति.

 Our terms are self-cxplanatory.

*Hylobatidae* (Gk. *hyla* 'wood'+*bates* '*climber*'+-*idae* 'suffix for the family') शाखामृग-वंश.  
*Cercopithecidae* (Gk. *kerkos* 'tail'+*pithekos* 'ape'+-*idae*) पुच्छकपि-वंश.  
*Otocolobus* (Gk. *otos* 'ear'+*kolobos* 'mutilated, stunted') लघुकर्ण-प्रजाति (genus प्रजाति characterized by having short लघु ears कर्ण).  
*Arctomys* (Gk.*arktoos* 'northern'+*mys* 'mouse' from Sanskrit मूष) हिममूष-प्रजाति (found on high altitudes: हिम 'now').  
*Perissodactyla* (Gk. *perissos* 'odd'+*daktylos* 'finger') विषमांगुल-अनुगण (विषम 'odd'+अंगुल 'toes'+ अनुगण+'suborder').  
*Artiodactyla* (Gk. *artios* 'even') समांगुल-अनुगण (सम 'even').

 The minutiae of the Western terminology have been duly attended to: the genus *Cervus* is महागृह-प्रजाति, while the diminutive *Cervulus* is क्षुद्रमृग-प्रजाति.

 In several cases, an exclusive characteristic has been made the basis of naming a species. *Macacaspeciosa*, the Stump-tailed Macaque, is distinguished by the shortness of the tail, which is reduced to a conical, sparsely hairy stump स्थूण—hence स्थूण-पुच्छ कोशमुख.

 A few more examples of the Indian names being more significant in as much as they incorporate the distinguishing features in themselves. The arboreal and terrestrial families of Shrews, the *Tupaiidae* and *Soricidae* are readily recognizable in तरुचुंचु-वंश and भूचुंचु-वंश (चुंचु ‘shrew' occurs in the हारावलीकोप). Similarly in *Hystricidae* and *Erethizontidae* which are respectively भूशल्यक-वंश and तरुशल्यक-वंश. In the same way a number of vague and ill-defined Latin words have been made more precise in our system by including the essential part of the definition. In Simplicidentata and Duplicidentata, Lat. *dentis*, which means any 'tooth', has been particularised by कृन्त which stands for the incisors. अदन्ततिमि-अनुगण and सदन्ततिमि-अनुगण bring out the difference between the two suborders Mystacocoeti and Odontocoeti far more accurately. In the heterogeneous order Edentata there are 'very few structural characters common to all the different suborders included in it, except the absence of teeth in the front of the jaw' (W. T. Blanford, Mammalia, 1888-91, p. 595). This common feature is well brought out in the Indian अनग्रदन्त-गण thus rendering it superior to its English name (fr. Lat. *edentatus*, past part.of *edentare* to render toothless) which 'is a misleading one as most of them have teeth' (Webster's New International Dictionary, second ed., 1948).

 In the matter of the bases of nomenclature, English follows its own line, only here and there conforming to the internal structure of the Latin designation. Even in matter of toponyms and eponyms, i.e. personal and geographical names, English shows scantyrespect to Latin. Here are a few examples:

*Canis aureus*: The Asiatic Jackal.  
Latin means “golden dog".  
*Hyaena hyaena hyaena*: The Indian hyaena.  
English has got rid of the hideous tautonym.  
*Synotus darjelingensis*: The Eastern Barbastelle.  
Here Darjeeling has been replaced by a more general term Eastern. In the previous examples, the geographical attributive had commended itself more to English than to Latin.  
*Vesperugo ceylonicus*: Kelaart's Bat.  
English replaces a toponym by an eponym.  
*Vesperugo blanfordi*: Limberg's Bat.  
The "honour" has shifted from one person to another.  
*Pantholops hodgsoni*: The Tibetan Antelope.  
The "honour" conferred on Hodgson by the Latin nomenclator has been taken away and the eponym replaced by a toponym.  
*Lepus tibetanus*: The Afghan Hare.  
This is a case of an exchange of toponyms.

 While the main purpose of our terminology is to provide Indian terms so as to make the spread of scientific knowledge possible, we have not failed to correct the confusion and inaccuracies of the European nomenclature. We have taken advantage of standing on the shoulders of our European predecessors and thus having a longer range of view, and fresh courage to bring order.

**The Chinese System**

 Chinese is an ancient language. Its present written characters go back to three thousand years. The written characters are its essence; much more than in any other language. They do not record the sound. Writing is on the whole independent of the sound. Still, every written character has to be  
pronounced. The pronunciation changes from locality to locality but the written symbols remain the same.

 There are forty thousand written characters. Three thousand are common. Making new words often means making new characters. One character means one word. Every word is only one syllable, as Chinese language along with Tibetan, Burmese, Thai and others is monosyllabic.

 Grammar plays little part in Chinese. The syntax and the context usually determine whether a particular word is a noun, adjective, verb or adverb.

 For one century, particularly since the rise of the modern newspapers, the Chinese have been creating new words with great rapidity. How they do it will be illustrated in this section.

**ATOMIC ENERGY**

We shall start with taking examples from a publication of the United Nations. It is a glossary of technical terms concerning atomic energy. It was issued in March 1948. Alongside English, French, Russian and Spanish it gives Chinese terms. Chinese is the only Asian language recognised for use at the United Nations.

 The Chinese Government has recently issued glossaries of several natural sciences. We shall take examples from them.

**CHEMISTRY**

<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1693375577Untitled5.jpg"/>

"Basic principles for giving names to chemical substances ".

It was published in August, 1953. It discusses chemical nomenclature chapter by chapter. It is the only volume in the series which is not arranged alphabetically.

The second chapter deals with names of elements.
